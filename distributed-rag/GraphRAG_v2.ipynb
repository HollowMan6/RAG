    "# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex - V2\n",
    "\n",
    "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions using Neo4J.\n",

    "This notebook updates the GraphRAG pipeline to v2. If you haven’t checked v1 yet, you can find it [here](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/docs/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v1.ipynb). Following are the updates to the existing implementation:\n",
