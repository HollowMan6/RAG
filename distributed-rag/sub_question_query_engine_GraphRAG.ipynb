    "# Sub Question Query Engine as a workflow with GraphRAG\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex has a built-in Sub-Question Query Engine. Here, we replace it with a Workflow-based equivalent and intergrate it with the GraphRAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions using Neo4J.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook updates the GraphRAG pipeline to v2. If you haven’t checked v1 yet, you can find it [here](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/docs/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v1.ipynb). Following are the updates to the existing implementation:\n",

    "\n",
    "The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.\n",
    "2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.\n",
    "3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.\n",
    "4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.\n",
    "5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.\n",
    "2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.\n",
    "3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extraction Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input node (chunk of text):\n",
    "1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.\n",
    "2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.\n",
    "3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata\n",
    "4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.\n",
    "5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage."

      "Final response is  The total amount of San Francisco's budget has changed significantly from 2016 to 2023. In 2016, the total budget was $9.6 billion. It increased to $10.1 billion in 2017 and further to $11.04 billion in 2018. There is a discrepancy in the data for 2019, with a reported budget of $4.03 billion, which seems unusually low compared to the surrounding years. Information for 2020 is not available. The budget then increased to $12.43 billion in 2021 and $13.25 billion in 2022. By 2023, the total budget reached $14.6 billion. Overall, there has been a substantial increase in San Francisco's budget over these years, with the exception of the anomalous figure for 2019.\n",
