{"result": "CIRROS is a small Linux distribution specifically designed for use as a test image on cloud platforms, such as OpenStack. It is provided by CSC for quick instance booting, primarily for testing purposes, and is not recommended for use in persistent virtual machines (VMs). CIRROS remains an active image available for use and is accessible in Pouta's project. This operating system is typically utilized for testing due to its lightweight nature, making it an ideal choice for users looking to conduct tests or experiments on cloud infrastructures without the need for a full-fledged OS.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
