{"result": "Rahti 1 is a comprehensive cloud service platform provided by CSC, specifically designed for open research and education in Finnish universities and polytechnics. It functions as part of a proxy setup, configured to relay requests to Rahti 2, and hosts an internal registry with a maximum image size limit of 5GB, considering images over 1GB as very big to ensure better performance and manageability. As a container cloud service, Rahti 1 offers extensive resources and tutorials on container technology and orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift, highlighting its capabilities in project creation and management within OpenShift environments.\n\nRahti 1 stands out for its authentication options, supporting command line login and project management features, which can be managed via tools such as OpenShift's oc tool or Kubernetes' kubectl tool, offering specific features for OpenShift when using the oc tool. It is a platform that, while not natively supporting GPUs, allows access through custom device plugins, specifically handling Nvidia GPUs. The service supports HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports for incoming traffic, uses HAProxy load balancers, and provides pre-created domain names with valid TLS certificates, ensuring applications are securely exposed to the Internet.\n\nSecurity is a paramount concern for Rahti 1, which provides guidelines and measures for securing routes and image security, as well as managing IP addresses for firewall openings. It emphasizes the importance of security for services running on it, offering scalable and fault-tolerant application deployment as a container orchestration service running on OKD.\n\nFrom a storage perspective, Rahti 1 provides local ephemeral (temporal) storage solutions, utilizing RAID-0 SSD storage for the fastest filesystem available, with the caveat that data is lost when the Pod is killed or restarted. Additionally, it supports templating service deployment code, allowing its reuse and lists default templates bundled with OKD in its Service Catalog.\n\nAs of 1.02.2020, Rahti 1 operates on a billing model that consumes CSC Billing Units, reflecting its value proposition to its target audience in the academic and research sectors. This platform is a pivotal resource for computing projects, offering a robust set of features for application hosting, including image registry and deployment capabilities, making it a versatile tool for users in need of a reliable container service platform.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
