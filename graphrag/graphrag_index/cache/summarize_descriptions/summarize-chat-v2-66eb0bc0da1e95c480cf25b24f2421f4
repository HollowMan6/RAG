{"result": "The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a versatile method used for interacting with various software components and operating systems, allowing users to perform specific tasks by typing commands. It is notably utilized in environments such as Rahti2, where it offers a command-line interface method for provisioning snapshots. This enables users to directly manage volume snapshots through commands. Additionally, the CLI is employed for interacting with database instances, facilitating operations like resizing the volume through specific commands. Beyond these applications, the CLI serves as a text-based user interface for viewing and managing computer files, showcasing its broad utility in executing a wide range of tasks across different platforms and systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
