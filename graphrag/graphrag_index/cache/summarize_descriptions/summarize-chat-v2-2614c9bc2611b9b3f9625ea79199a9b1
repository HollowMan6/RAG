{"result": "EPOUTA, also known as ePouta, is a comprehensive cloud service platform provided by CSC, specifically designed for handling and processing sensitive data with high security and privacy requirements. It offers a variety of virtual machine flavors to cater to different computing needs, including standard, I/O, GPU, and HPC (High Performance Computing) flavors, each with specific cores, memory, disk sizes, and billing units. Unlike its counterpart, cPouta, ePouta emphasizes security, especially for tasks requiring high performance and sensitivity in data handling. This emphasis is evident in its infrastructure, which includes redundant power, Intel Xeon CPUs, and local SSD disks for computing instances.\n\nePouta operates as a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service, ensuring that sensitive data is managed with the utmost security. Access to the service requires a direct connection to the Private IP, as it does not provide Virtual IPs, and necessitates an MPLS VPN connection, highlighting its focus on privacy and security. Initial quotas for the service are agreed upon at the project's start, and the service will be disabled for the project upon closure, including powering off all virtual machines.\n\nThis cloud service is managed by the organization's own IT unit, offering flexibility and the ability to meet specific requirements, making it an ideal infrastructure service for research organizations. ePouta's design for sensitive data and computing ensures high security and privacy, distinguishing it from other cloud services by its capability to handle high-security tasks and its requirement for traffic considerations, especially for connections going over the internet to Pukki.\n\nIn comparison to SD Desktop and its sibling service, cPouta, ePouta may offer different or additional features, including floating IP addresses and short-lived virtual machines as shared resources. It is a variant of the Pouta cloud service, with project selection through the OpenStack Horizon UI, and is designed to provide a secure and flexible computing environment, particularly for sensitive data handling.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
