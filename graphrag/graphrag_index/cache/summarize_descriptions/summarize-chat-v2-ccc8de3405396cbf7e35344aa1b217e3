{"result": "RAHTI is a comprehensive container cloud service provided by CSC, designed to support the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications across a cluster of servers. It is based on OpenShift OKD and incorporates OpenStack and Kubernetes technologies, enabling users to host applications and services in containers and make them accessible over the web. RAHTI is notable for its ability to integrate with CSC supercomputers, such as Puhti and Mahti, although it is recognized for its complexity in establishing these connections.\n\nRAHTI offers a range of features tailored to various needs, including project management, resource quota applications, and project sharing capabilities. Upon the closure of a project, RAHTI sets the project pod quota to 0 and stops all workloads, ensuring efficient resource utilization. It supports two versions, Rahti 1 and Rahti 2, each offering different features and configurations, such as TLS support and unique egress IPs, to cater to diverse application requirements.\n\nAdditionally, RAHTI provides tutorials on deploying applications, managing Docker Hub credentials, caching images, and data transfer, making it a valuable resource for users at different levels of expertise. It also allows for the setup of HTTP redirection using web servers like nginx and offers a wildcard SSL certificate for DNS names under the subdomain `*.2.rahtiapp.fi`, managing the certificate renewal and installation process.\n\nOne of RAHTI's unique aspects is its billing system, which operates with its own rates, and the way it maps OpenShift projects to CSC projects using the Description field of the OpenShift project. Despite its comprehensive tracking of usage, RAHTI records all use without user information, indicating a focus on privacy and a lack of detailed usage tracking.\n\nIn summary, RAHTI is a versatile and complex cloud service by CSC that provides a robust platform for deploying, managing, and scaling applications and services in containers, offering detailed guidance and support for users, while ensuring privacy and efficient resource management.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
