{"result": "Rahti 2 is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) based on Kubernetes, offering container-based platform deployment in a shared Kubernetes cluster. It is a container cloud system that utilizes the OpenShift distribution of Kubernetes, running on Linux as its operating system. This platform is designed for deploying a simple CI/CD pipeline using Kubernetes concepts and supports HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports for incoming traffic, utilizing HAProxy load balancers to manage incoming virtual IP traffic. Rahti 2 allows for project creation, user and group access management, and project deletion functionalities, making it a versatile platform for managing Kubernetes applications, possibly related to or a part of Helm's ecosystem.\n\nRahti 2 is known for its container orchestration capabilities, offering services related to container technology and orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift. It is provided by CSC for computing projects and does not run images as root, which can lead to permission denied errors for containers expecting root access. This platform is running on OKD, offering scalable and fault-tolerant application deployment. It supports various operations, including data storage and backup solutions, and allows for the sending of e-mails, potentially involving large amounts of SMTP traffic for services like public mailing lists.\n\nThe platform supports automatic horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU and Memory consumption and allows the use of a wildcard certificate for `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` DNS names. It can be accessed and managed via command line tools such as OpenShift's oc tool or Kubernetes' kubectl tool. Rahti 2 provides local ephemeral (temporal) storage solutions, utilizing RAID-1 SSD storage local to the node and offering the fastest filesystem available in Rahti 2. It supports internal UDP traffic for Pod to Pod communications within the same namespace but does not allow external UDP connections, emphasizing the importance of security for services running on it.\n\nRahti 2 implements security measures such as no root privileges, random UID/GID, restricted-v2 policy, default pod resource limits, TLS encryption for routes, and advises on image security and IP addresses for firewall openings. It includes an internal registry for images which can be deployed using the image stream option and supports database hosting as part of CSC's cloud offerings. Rahti 2 provides a catalog of applications and components, including databases, and follows updates from Redhat, the upstream provider. It supports webhooks to trigger rebuilds for applications and uses IPv4 for all networking, divided into Namespaces or Projects, with", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
