{"result": "Elmer is an open-source Finite Element Method (FEM) multi-physics simulation package developed and made available under the CSC's module tree. It is designed for comprehensive multiphysical simulations, covering a wide range of applications including fluid and solid mechanics, acoustics, and electro-magneto dynamics. As a versatile software environment, Elmer supports solving problems across various fields of computational physics and engineering. Its capabilities make it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers seeking to conduct detailed simulations in multiple physical domains simultaneously.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

However, based on the provided text snippet, there are no explicit mentions of persons, geographical locations, or events that fit the criteria for extraction as entities or relationships according to the instructions and the entity types provided (organization, person, geo, event). The text primarily discusses the use of Elmer software in computational physics and engineering contexts, and mentions a practice related to computing resources (undersubscribing nodes) without referencing specific organizations, people, geographical locations, or events beyond the Elmer software itself.Given the nature of the text and the instructions for entity and relationship extraction, there are no additional entities or relationships to extract from the provided text snippet beyond the initial extraction related to the Elmer organization. The text does not provide enough context or information to identify other entities such as persons, geographical locations, or events that are clearly related to Elmer or each other within the scope of the provided instructions.If there were more context or additional text provided that included specific names of people involved with Elmer, locations where significant events related to Elmer took place, or specific events tied to the Elmer organization, then it would be possible to identify and extract more entities and their relationships. Without such information, the output remains as initially provided.<|COMPLETE|>\", \"Open source multi-physics FEM package\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
