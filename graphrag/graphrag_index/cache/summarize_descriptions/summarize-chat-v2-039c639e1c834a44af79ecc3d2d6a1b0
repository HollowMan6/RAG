{"result": "CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to manage the build process of software in a compiler-independent manner. It is an extensible software build system that uses CMakeLists.txt files to generate Makefile build files for compiling source code, creating libraries, generating wrappers, and building executable binaries. CMake supports multiple versions available as extensions of another module on the system, emphasizing its flexibility and adaptability across various development environments. This tool is integral for developers looking to build, test, and package software efficiently and effectively across different platforms.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
