{"result": "Helmi is the first Finnish quantum computer, co-developed by VTT and IQM Quantum Computers, characterized by its 5-qubit capacity and superconducting qubits. It features a star-shaped topology, which is significant for qubit mapping in quantum computing. Helmi supports job submissions using both Qiskit and Cirq, indicating its compatibility with a specific computing resource or location within the quantum computing context. This platform is accessible through LUMI, where users are required to set up projects and accounts for access, specifically via the FiQCI partition on LUMI for running quantum computing jobs. Helmi is associated with specific basis gates and offers a quantum computing environment provided by CSC, allowing users to run quantum jobs and circuits. It is a real quantum computer that supports quantum software stacks like Qiskit and Cirq, making it a versatile and accessible platform for quantum computing projects.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
