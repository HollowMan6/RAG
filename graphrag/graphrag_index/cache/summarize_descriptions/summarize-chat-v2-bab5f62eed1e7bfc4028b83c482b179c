{"result": "Rahti 2 is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) based on the OpenShift distribution of Kubernetes, utilizing Linux as its operating system and is provided by CSC for computing projects. It represents the next version of OpenShift OKD running in CSC, using Kubernetes version v1.28 and cri-o as the container runtime. This platform is designed for container-based platform deployment in a shared Kubernetes cluster, offering services related to container technology and orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift. Rahti 2 supports various operations, including data storage, backup solutions, and database hosting, but it does not support non-HTTP traffic from external sources.\n\nRahti 2 allows users to manage container deployments and scaling, emphasizing security with measures such as no root privileges, random UID/GID, restricted-v2 policy, default pod resource limits, TLS encryption for routes, and advises on image security and IP addresses for firewall openings. It supports HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports for incoming traffic, uses HAProxy load balancers for managing incoming virtual IP traffic, and supports internal UDP traffic for Pod to Pod communications within the same namespace. However, it does not allow external UDP connections but supports HTTP/HTTPS for Routes and TCP ports for oc port-forwarding.\n\nThe platform enables project creation, user and group access management, project deletion functionalities, and automatic horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU and Memory consumption. It also allows the use of a wildcard certificate for `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` DNS names and can be accessed and managed via command line tools such as OpenShift's oc tool or Kubernetes' kubectl tool. Rahti 2 provides local ephemeral (temporal) storage solutions, utilizing RAID-1 SSD storage local to the node and offers the fastest filesystem available in Rahti 2. Data can be stored using either a persistent volume or an object storage service, with a change in behavior regarding volume creation, where the volume is only created when mounted for the first time.\n\nRahti 2 is mentioned in various contexts such as database access, CI/CD, deploying web servers, and sending e-mails, potentially involving large amounts of SMTP traffic for services like public mailing lists. It supports webhooks to trigger rebuilds for applications, indicating a platform or service that integrates with various version control systems. The platform provides a catalog of applications and components, including databases, and follows updates from Redhat, the upstream provider. It also provides a web interface for users to interact with", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
