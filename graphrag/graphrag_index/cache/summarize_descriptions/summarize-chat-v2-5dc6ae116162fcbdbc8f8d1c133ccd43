{"result": "STANDARD.SMALL is a flavor in OpenStack designed to define the compute, memory, and storage capacity of virtual machines, or instances, tailored for small use cases. It is specifically utilized to specify the size of a Database as a Service (DBaaS) instance, indicating a smaller database instance size suitable for less demanding applications. This database instance flavor is equipped with 2 cores and 2000 MB (approximately 1.9 GiB) of memory. It is billed at 2 units per hour, making it a cost-effective option for users. STANDARD.SMALL is also available as a virtual machine flavor in both cPouta and ePouta environments, where it offers full redundancy in power, data, and network connections to ensure reliability and uptime. In addition to the core and memory specifications, the ePouta flavor of STANDARD.SMALL includes 80 GB of total disk space, further enhancing its storage capabilities. This configuration makes STANDARD.SMALL a versatile and economical choice for deploying small-scale applications and services within the OpenStack framework.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
