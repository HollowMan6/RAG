{"result": "AMBER is a comprehensive molecular dynamics package designed for performing simulations of biomolecules. It is a versatile software suite that includes a variety of tools for analysis, NMR structure refinement, and other simulations relevant to the field of chemistry. AMBER is available under an academic license and is part of the CSC software stack, accessible via CSC's module tree, including on LUMI servers. This suite of biomolecular simulation programs, known as AMBER, also encompasses AmberTools and has been developed collaboratively by a wide range of researchers. Notably, AMBER is capable of running on both CPUs and GPUs, making it adaptable to various computational environments. This makes AMBER a critical resource for researchers in the field of molecular dynamics, offering a robust platform for the simulation and analysis of biomolecules.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
