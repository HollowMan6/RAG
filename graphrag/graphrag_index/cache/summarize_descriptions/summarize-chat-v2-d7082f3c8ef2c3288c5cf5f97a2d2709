{"result": "SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK is an environment variable in the SLURM workload manager, a highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters. This variable specifies the number of CPU cores allocated per task within a SLURM job. It is used in Slurm job scripts and is defined by the parameter --cpus-per-task, which directly indicates the amount of CPU cores to be allocated for each task. This setting is crucial for optimizing the distribution of computational resources across tasks in a SLURM-managed cluster environment, ensuring that each task has the necessary computational power as defined by the user or administrator.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
