{"result": "SLURM, an acronym for Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management, is an open-source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system designed for Linux clusters of all sizes, from small to large. It is widely used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments for allocating resources, managing, and monitoring jobs on supercomputers, computing clusters, and computing grids. SLURM provides a comprehensive framework for submitting, scheduling, and managing jobs on computing clusters, enabling users to execute parallel jobs efficiently. It allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for a specified duration, facilitating the execution of work. Additionally, SLURM manages a queue of pending work, arbitrating contention for resources among users.\n\nSLURM is integrated with tools like Snakemake and is compatible with various computing environments, including CSC's supercomputers, LUMI, Puhti, and Mahti. It supports batch job submission, interactive applications, and offers monitoring and controlling capabilities for jobs. SLURM's design addresses challenges such as excess log data and scheduling overhead when dealing with a large number of jobs, making it an efficient solution for managing jobs and resources on multi-node and multi-core computers.\n\nAs a workload manager, SLURM is mentioned in various contexts, including its use in running FARMING jobs efficiently, as part of a workaround for a gdb4hpc issue, and in the usage process for Intel VTune Profiler. It is also used for scalability tests and managing job queues on supercomputer clusters like Puhti. SLURM's role in HPC systems is critical for research and computational tasks, providing a reliable platform for submitting jobs to the batch queue, allocating computational resources, and optimizing job scheduling across diverse computing environments.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
