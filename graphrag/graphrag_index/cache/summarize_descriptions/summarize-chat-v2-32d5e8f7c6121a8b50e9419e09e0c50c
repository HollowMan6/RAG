{"result": "A SNAPSHOT is a saved state of a virtual machine's storage in the Pouta cloud environment, specifically designed to capture the file system state at a specific point in time. It is a method used within Pouta for creating a point-in-time copy of an instance. This snapshot excludes ephemeral storage, focusing solely on the permanent aspects of the storage system. Once created, a snapshot can be utilized to boot a new instance, allowing for the selection of a different flavor, thereby providing flexibility and recovery options for users. This tool is essential for data protection, system recovery, and the efficient management of virtual machine instances in the Pouta cloud environment.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
