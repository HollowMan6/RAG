{"result": "TURBOMOLE is a sophisticated computational chemistry software developed by the University of Karlsruhe and Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, and it is currently maintained by TURBOMOLE GmbH. This program package is designed for electronic structure calculations and is renowned for its efficiency in studying large molecular systems. It offers a wide range of computational methods and properties applicable to both ground and excited states, making it a versatile tool for performing quantum chemical calculations on molecular systems. TURBOMOLE is instrumental in optimizing molecular structures, calculating energies, and simulating spectra, thereby serving as an essential resource for researchers in the field of computational chemistry.\n\nThe software is compatible with TmoleX, which enhances its usability for quantum chemistry calculations, and it can also be used in conjunction with COSMOconf to generate COSMO files for analyzing relevant conformations. Over the years, TURBOMOLE has seen continuous development and updates, with versions 7.5.1, 7.7, and the latest 7.8 being installed on high-performance computing environments such as Puhti and Mahti. Version 7.8 is currently set as the default module on these platforms, featuring new functionalities and improvements, particularly in the `ricc2` module, which signifies its ongoing evolution to meet the demands of modern computational chemistry tasks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
