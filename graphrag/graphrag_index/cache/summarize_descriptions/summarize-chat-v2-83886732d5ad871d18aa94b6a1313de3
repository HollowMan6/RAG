{"result": "SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol designed for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. It is widely used for secure remote logins, command execution, and data transfer, making it a fundamental tool for securely accessing and managing remote computers, virtual machines (VMs), and supercomputers such as Puhti and Mahti. SSH requires port 22 to be open for ingress traffic, enabling users to establish a secure connection between computers for various purposes, including troubleshooting login issues, performing secure rsync transfers, and tunneling X11 for remote graphics.\n\nSSH is particularly noted for its role in securely logging into various systems over a network, including CSC's Puhti supercomputer, and for facilitating secure connections to remote servers specified as the remote shell for rsync transfers. It is also mentioned in the context of security updates, notably due to the Terrapin vulnerability affecting systems like Puhti and Mahti, highlighting its importance in maintaining secure network services.\n\nFurthermore, SSH is a key tool for securely accessing and managing computers over an unsecured network, including specific references to secure access to remote computers such as Kvasi and Puhti. It is also a Linux tool used for secure remote login from one computer to another, emphasizing its utility and widespread application in secure communications and network services over insecure networks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
