{"result": "Visual Studio Code, colloquially known as VS Code, is a versatile and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is designed to support a wide array of programming languages and features, making it a powerful tool for developers. Available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, VS Code has been embraced by the coding community for its flexibility and comprehensive functionality. This application stands out for its ability to receive updates across web interfaces, ensuring users have access to the latest features and improvements.\n\nOne of the key features of Visual Studio Code is its support for remote development through the Remote SSH extension. This allows developers to write and edit code directly on remote machines, such as CSC supercomputers, including Mahti, Puhti, and LUMI. Specifically, it is listed as an interactive application on LUMI's web interface, enabling users to edit and run code efficiently on this platform. The integration of VS Code with these supercomputers underscores its utility in high-performance computing environments.\n\nMoreover, Visual Studio Code's interactive application is accessible via web interfaces on various platforms, including LUMI, where it supports a range of programming languages and extensions. This adaptability facilitates a seamless coding experience, whether working on local projects or managing complex tasks on supercomputers. By combining its open-source nature with robust support for remote development and a user-friendly interface, Visual Studio Code has established itself as a preferred choice for developers around the globe.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
