{"result": "Rahti 2 is a comprehensive container cloud service provided by CSC, designed to support computing projects with a focus on container technology and orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift. It operates on the OpenShift distribution of Kubernetes, utilizing Linux as its operating system, and runs on OKD, offering scalable and fault-tolerant application deployment. Rahti 2 is known for its robust platform capabilities, including deploying simple CI/CD pipelines, database access, and web servers, highlighting its versatility as a computing or cloud service platform.\n\nThe platform supports various operations, including data storage and backup solutions, with options for using either a persistent volume or an object storage service. It provides local ephemeral (temporal) storage solutions, utilizing RAID-1 SSD storage local to the node, offering the fastest filesystem available. Additionally, Rahti 2 allows for automatic horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU and Memory consumption and supports HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports for incoming traffic, utilizing HAProxy load balancers for managing incoming virtual IP traffic. It also supports internal UDP traffic for Pod to Pod communications within the same namespace but restricts external UDP connections, emphasizing security with measures such as no root privileges, random UID/GID, restricted-v2 policy, default pod resource limits, TLS encryption for routes, and advises on image security and IP addresses for firewall openings.\n\nRahti 2's platform is distinct for not running images as root, which can lead to permission denied errors for containers expecting root access. It includes an internal registry for images deployable using the image stream option and supports webhooks to trigger rebuilds for applications, integrating with various version control systems. The platform may require SSH keys for building from private GitHub repositories and supports database hosting, although it does not support non-HTTP traffic from external sources.\n\nThe service provides a web interface for users to interact with Pods, including opening terminals to running Pods, and offers a catalog of applications and components, including databases, following updates from Redhat, the upstream provider. Rahti 2 allows project creation, user and group access management, project deletion functionalities, and utilizes Kubernetes namespaces with additional annotations for project management and storage solutions. It supports the sending of e-mails, potentially involving large amounts of SMTP traffic for services like public mailing lists, and uses a wildcard certificate for `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` DNS names. The platform's applications are exposed to the Internet, emphasizing the importance of security for services running on it.\n\nRahti 2", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
