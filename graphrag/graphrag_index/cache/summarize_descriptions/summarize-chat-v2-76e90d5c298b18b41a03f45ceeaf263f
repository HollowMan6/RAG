{"result": "LUMI-G is a specialized hardware partition within the LUMI supercomputer ecosystem, known for its massive GPU capacity and designed specifically for GPU-intensive tasks. It consists of 2978 compute nodes, each equipped with 4 AMD MI250x GPUs and a single 64 cores AMD EPYC \"Trento\" CPU. These nodes are organized into 24 electrical groups of 124 nodes each, with the last group containing 126 nodes, all interconnected by 32 switches in an all-to-all configuration. This setup delivers an aggregated HPL Linpack performance of 379.70 PFlop/s, highlighting its significant compute power.\n\nUnlike typical compute nodes, LUMI-G nodes do not have local storage and instead rely on network-based storage options. This partition is optimized for GPU usage, featuring GPU accelerated nodes using AMD Instinct MI250X GPUs. It supports a specific part of the LUMI computing environment designated for certain programming environments and offers a system configuration for building containers with cotainr, possibly optimized for GPU usage.\n\nLUMI-G implements a low-noise mode across its compute nodes, which involves reserving one core to the operating system and disabling the first core in each of the 8 L3 regions. This adjustment leaves 56 cores available for jobs, ensuring efficient operation while minimizing operational noise. Additionally, LUMI-G nodes utilize ROCM drivers for operations, and it is a partition within the LUMI software stack environment where cpeAMD will become available, further enhancing its capabilities for specialized computing tasks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
