{"result": "EPOUTA, also known as ePouta, is a cloud service platform provided by CSC, designed specifically for handling sensitive data and computing with high security and privacy requirements. It offers a variety of virtual machine flavors to cater to different computing needs, including standard, I/O, GPU, and HPC (High Performance Computing) flavors, each with specific cores, memory, disk sizes, and billing units. Unlike its counterpart, cPouta, ePouta may offer different or additional features, such as redundant power, Intel Xeon CPUs, and local SSD disks for computing instances.\n\nAs a virtual private cloud service, ePouta emphasizes security, especially for traffic that goes over the internet, requiring MPLS VPN connection for access. This focus on security makes it suitable for research organizations and projects that deal with sensitive data. Managed by the organization's own IT unit, ePouta provides the flexibility to meet specific requirements, making it an infrastructure service that offers a high degree of control and customization.\n\nHowever, ePouta does not provide Virtual IPs and requires a direct connection to the Private IP, which distinguishes it from some other cloud services. It also features a policy where the service will be disabled for a project upon closure, including powering off all virtual machines, ensuring that sensitive data is handled with utmost care even at the end of a project's lifecycle.\n\nePouta is related to cPouta as another cloud service offering by CSC, potentially focusing on different aspects or functionalities within the cloud computing spectrum. It allows for project selection through the OpenStack Horizon UI and offers floating IP addresses and short-lived virtual machines as shared resources, providing a comprehensive set of features for users with high security and privacy needs.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
