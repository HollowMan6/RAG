{"result": "SD Connect is a comprehensive service provided by CSC, designed for securely managing, storing, and sharing sensitive data. It serves as a crucial component of the CSC Sensitive Data Services, enabling users to upload, download, encrypt, and decrypt files up to 100 GB directly through a web browser, with support for larger files via command line interface. This platform is suitable for all file types and formats, catering to various research fields with data stored securely in Finland.\n\nSD Connect offers a range of functionalities, including automated file encryption and decryption, key management, and three levels of sharing permissions across CSC projects, ensuring that sensitive data is handled with the utmost security. It supports federated authentication methods, allowing for seamless access and management of data. The service is directly accessible through the public internet without the need for installing any software, making it highly accessible for users.\n\nThe platform is not only a directory for encrypting and uploading `.vsix` files for VS Code extensions but also facilitates the uploading and managing of data buckets, PostgreSQL containers, installation packages, and other tools. It is compatible with modern web browsers, though not with Firefox incognito mode, and requires login for accessing its features.\n\nSD Connect is also integrated with SD Desktop, providing services for importing data securely, ensuring proper encryption for processing sensitive data. It allows for the storage of data, including files, virtual desktops, and volumes, with a default storage space of 10 TB provided by Allas, expandable up to 200 TB. The platform supports the uploading of sensitive data to the cloud, automatically encrypting files smaller than 1 GB, and is used for storing sensitive research data, although it is not accessible for registry data processing.\n\nAdditionally, SD Connect facilitates data sharing between different teams, offering functionalities like upload, share, download, and delete, with files and folders being automatically decrypted after download. It provides a web-user interface designed for sensitive data storage and sharing, facilitating data management throughout various research stages. The platform also allows users to manage files, including uploading, sharing, downloading, and deleting files and folders, and supports the importing of Apptainer containers to SD Desktop.\n\nA new version of SD Connect is available for testing purposes, featuring enhanced capabilities such as automated file encryption and decryption for files up to 100 GB, along with improved key management and sharing permissions. This service is part of CSC's commitment to providing secure and efficient solutions for sensitive data computing, making it an essential tool for researchers and teams requiring", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
