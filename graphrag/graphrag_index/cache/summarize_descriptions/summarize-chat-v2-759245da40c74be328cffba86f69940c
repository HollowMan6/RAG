{"result": "Gaussian is a comprehensive computational chemistry software widely used for quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations, as well as for molecular electronic structure calculations. It is a versatile program package designed for electronic structure modeling, making it an essential tool in the field of computational chemistry. Gaussian can be run on various platforms, including CSC's Puhti and Mahti servers, and it supports a range of calculations, possibly including RB3LYP calculations as indicated in some user logs. The software is not only referenced for citation and user guidance but also supported by tutorials for farming jobs using HyperQueue, provided by CSC. Additionally, Gaussian's compatibility with Gabedit enhances its usability on platforms like Puhti, facilitating a more user-friendly interface for conducting complex computational tasks. Overall, Gaussian serves as a pivotal application in computational chemistry, offering robust capabilities for researchers and scientists engaged in electronic structure modeling and related simulations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
