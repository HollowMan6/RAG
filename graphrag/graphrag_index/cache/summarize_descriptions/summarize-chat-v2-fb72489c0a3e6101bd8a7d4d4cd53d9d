{"result": "LUMI-F is a high-performance, flash-based Lustre filesystem within the LUMI infrastructure, designed specifically for temporary data storage. It operates as a hardware partition on LUMI, contributing significantly to the total storage capacity with its flash-based parallel file system. This specialized storage solution is part of LUMI's parallel filesystems storage infrastructure, offering an impressive storage capacity of 8 petabytes (PB) and an aggregate bandwidth of 1,740 gigabytes per second (GB/s), utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) for fast data access and processing. LUMI-F stands out for its high performance storage capabilities, making it an ideal option for users in need of fast flash-based Lustre scratch space. However, it is important to note that LUMI-F bills at a rate 10 times higher than the main storage options available on LUMI, reflecting its premium performance and storage capacity.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
