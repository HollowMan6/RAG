{"result": "The Scratch Directory is a temporary storage space on Puhti, specifically designed for project files and computational data that are actively used during the runtime of a project. It is highly recommended for tasks such as indexing the genome with Bowtie2, as it helps avoid using up valuable space in the home directory. This directory serves as an essential resource for users who need to manage large datasets or perform intensive computational tasks, ensuring that their home directory remains uncluttered and that the system's performance is optimized.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
