This license is notable for its application across a wide range of software, including but not limited to bioinformatics tools and applications. Specifically, GPLv3 is the license under which several key bioinformatics tools are available, ensuring their free use, distribution, and modification under the same terms. These tools include Exonerate, STAR, Salmon, wtdbg2, BayeScan, BioPerl, MrBayes, BWA, Bowtie2, FastQC, HMMER, Megahit, Prokka, RAxML, Roary, Stacks, and iPyrad. Each of these tools, ranging from sequence alignment and analysis to phylogenetic reconstruction, is freely available and open source under GPLv3, highlighting the license's significant role in promoting open science and the free exchange of scientific tools and resources within the community.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
