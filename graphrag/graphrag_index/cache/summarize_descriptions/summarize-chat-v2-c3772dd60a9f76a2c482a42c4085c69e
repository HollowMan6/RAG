{"result": "The Workspace Shared Folder is a shared directory within the Noppe service, designed to facilitate collaboration among users in a workspace. This shared volume is created specifically for each workspace and is persisted throughout the workspace's lifetime. It comes with a default size of 20 GB and is mounted in the `$HOME/shared` directory. Access to this folder is tiered: the workspace owner and managers or co-owners have full access, allowing them to modify, add, and delete files as needed, while other users are granted read-only access, enabling them to view and download files without making changes. This structure ensures that critical information and resources can be shared efficiently and securely within the workspace, promoting a collaborative environment.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
