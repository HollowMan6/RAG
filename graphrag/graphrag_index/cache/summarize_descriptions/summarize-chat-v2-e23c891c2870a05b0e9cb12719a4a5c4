{"result": "CRYPT4GH is a versatile encryption tool designed specifically for the secure handling of sensitive data, particularly human genetic data, in accordance with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards. Developed by CSC (IT Center for Science in Finland), CRYPT4GH serves a dual purpose of encrypting and decrypting files, making it an essential application for researchers and professionals dealing with sensitive genetic information. It supports operations such as encryption, decryption, and key generation, utilizing both public and private keys to ensure secure data transfer.\n\nThis tool is capable of encrypting files up to 100 GB, making it suitable for large datasets, and it is specifically recommended for securing files downloaded from SD Connect. CRYPT4GH files are typically marked with a `.c4gh` extension, indicating their encrypted state. It is also compatible with CSC Sensitive Data Services, highlighting its utility in encrypting sensitive research data across various formats before export or upload. Notably, CRYPT4GH allows for encryption using several public keys, which is a feature leveraged within CSC's sensitive data services to enhance data security.\n\nFurthermore, CRYPT4GH is recognized for its asymmetric encryption capabilities, recommended by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health for encrypting large datasets. This tool is not only a method for encrypting data formats within CSC Sensitive Data Services but is also an encryption utility used for securing data before upload to Finnish FEGA, underscoring its broad application in the field of genomics and health research.\n\nIn summary, CRYPT4GH is a comprehensive encryption solution developed by CSC, adhering to GA4GH standards for the secure encryption and sharing of human genetic data. Its functionality extends to encrypting and decrypting large files and datasets, supporting secure data analysis and transfer with its robust key generation and management features.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
