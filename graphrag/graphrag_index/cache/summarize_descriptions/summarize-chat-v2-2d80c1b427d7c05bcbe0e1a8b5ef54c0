{"result": "STANDARD is a Slurm partition on LUMI designed for jobs that necessitate the use of all resources on a node, primarily catering to CPU-intensive tasks. It operates in exclusive mode, meaning it bills for the entire node regardless of the number of cores utilized. This setup ensures that tasks requiring significant computational power have the necessary resources allocated exclusively to them, optimizing performance for demanding applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
