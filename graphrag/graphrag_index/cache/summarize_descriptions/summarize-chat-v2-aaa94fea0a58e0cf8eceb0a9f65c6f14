{"result": "Materials Studio is a versatile modeling suite designed for building and performing quantum and classical simulations of molecules, materials, and nanostructures. It is recognized for its comprehensive capabilities in materials modeling. However, it's important to note that the license for Materials Studio, provided by CSC, will be discontinued after 2023. This indicates that users may need to seek alternative solutions or arrangements for their molecular modeling needs beyond this timeframe.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
