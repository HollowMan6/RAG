{"result": "Rahti 1 is a comprehensive container cloud service provided by CSC, specifically designed for open research and education in Finnish universities and polytechnics. It operates as part of a proxy setup, configured to relay requests to Rahti 2, and hosts an internal registry with a maximum image size limit of 5GB, considering images over 1GB as very big to ensure better performance and manageability. As a platform running on OKD, Rahti 1 offers scalable and fault-tolerant application deployment, emphasizing the importance of security for services running on it. It supports HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports for incoming traffic, uses HAProxy load balancers, and provides pre-created domain names with valid TLS certificates. Applications on Rahti 1 are exposed to the Internet, with guidelines and measures for securing routes, image security, and managing IP addresses for firewall openings.\n\nRahti 1 offers a range of authentication options and project creation capabilities, including command line login and project management features, which can be managed via tools such as OpenShift's oc tool or Kubernetes' kubectl tool. It provides specific features for OpenShift when using the oc tool and does not natively support GPUs but allows access through custom device plugins, specifically handling Nvidia GPUs. The platform is a container orchestration service at CSC, running on OKD, and offers resources and tutorials on container technology and orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nFurthermore, Rahti 1 provides local ephemeral (temporal) storage solutions, utilizing RAID-0 SSD storage for the fastest filesystem available, with the caveat that data is lost when the Pod is killed or restarted. It supports templating service deployment code, allowing its re-use and lists default templates bundled with OKD in its Service Catalog. Rahti 1, the current deployed version of OpenShift OKD running in CSC, uses Kubernetes version v1.11 and is in open beta. Starting from 1.02.2020, the service consumes CSC Billing Units, indicating a structured approach to resource usage and billing for its users.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
