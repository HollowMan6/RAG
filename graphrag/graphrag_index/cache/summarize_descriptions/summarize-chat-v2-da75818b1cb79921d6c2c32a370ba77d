{"result": "MPI, or Message Passing Interface, is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. It serves as a standard for parallel programming in distributed computing environments, enabling communication among processes, each having its own memory, across multiple nodes. MPI is utilized for running parallel programs across multiple nodes, facilitating efficient execution of parallel applications. This system is particularly mentioned in the context of Fortran MPI programs, hybrid MPI+OpenMP jobs, building parallel applications in environments like Mahti, and launching MPI \"hello world\" applications with tools such as gdb4hpc. MPI-based batch jobs highlight its capability for each task to have its own memory allocation, underscoring its importance in parallel computing environments where efficient and effective communication and computation are critical.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
