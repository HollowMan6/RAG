{"result": "A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software computer that emulates a physical computer, running an operating system and applications. It is a computing resource in Pouta, an environment provided by CSC, which can be accessed and managed through various methods. The VM operates within the OpenStack platform, allowing for optimization of billing units and offering the flexibility to use default or custom network settings. This virtual computing environment is designed to be isolated from the internet for enhanced security reasons.\n\nVirtual machines in Pouta exhibit various states, including active, shut off, paused, suspended, shelved, and terminated. Each state impacts resource usage and billing, making it essential for users to manage their VMs efficiently. The process of creating and running a VM in Pouta involves utilizing the service to support the creation of these machines, ensuring users can tailor their virtual computing resources to meet their specific needs.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
