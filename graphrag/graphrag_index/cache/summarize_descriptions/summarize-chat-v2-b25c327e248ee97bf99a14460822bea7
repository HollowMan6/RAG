{"result": "SSH keys are a pair of cryptographic keys that serve as a digital fingerprint used for authenticating computers and users over a network. They are a form of secure identification that allows users to establish a secure connection for data transfer. SSH keys are employed as a method for secure authentication, enabling access to services like RStudio Server on Puhti via SSH tunneling. Additionally, they facilitate secure remote login from one computer to another. These keys are integral to the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, where they enhance communication security and access control by ensuring that the connection between the client and the server is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
