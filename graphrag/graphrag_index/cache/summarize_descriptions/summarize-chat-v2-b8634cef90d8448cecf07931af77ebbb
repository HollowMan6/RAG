{"result": "SLURM, an acronym for Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management, is an open-source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system designed for Linux clusters of all sizes. It is widely used on many of the world's supercomputers, computing clusters, and high-performance computing (HPC) systems, including notable installations on CSC and LUMI supercomputers, as well as the Puhti cluster. SLURM's primary function is to allocate exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to computational resources (computer nodes) to users for a specified duration, enabling the execution of work, typically parallel jobs. It provides a comprehensive framework for submitting, scheduling, managing, and monitoring jobs on computing clusters, supercomputers, and computing grids, including multi-node and multi-core computers.\n\nSLURM supports a variety of computing environments, facilitating the submission of jobs to batch queues, managing job scheduling, and offering monitoring capabilities. It is particularly noted for its integration with tools like Snakemake, enhancing its utility in complex computational workflows. SLURM ensures efficient resource allocation for both batch and interactive applications, managing contention for resources through a queue of pending work. This workload manager is also capable of running and managing jobs on CSC machines, including batch job creation and submission, and is used by LUMI for submitting and managing jobs on the HPC cluster.\n\nAs a job scheduler, SLURM is instrumental in allocating resources, managing, and monitoring jobs on high-performance computing clusters. Its design caters to the needs of a wide range of computing environments, from single-cluster setups to extensive computing clouds, making it a versatile tool for researchers and IT professionals. The system's fault tolerance and scalability make it suitable for small research labs to large-scale academic and commercial organizations, emphasizing its role in facilitating high-performance computing across various scientific disciplines.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
