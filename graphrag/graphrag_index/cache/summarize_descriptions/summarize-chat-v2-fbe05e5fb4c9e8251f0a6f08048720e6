{"result": "HAKA is a comprehensive identity federation and authentication service provider primarily serving educational and research institutions in Finland. It enables users affiliated with Finnish higher education institutions, polytechnics, and research institutes to access a wide range of services through a single sign-on mechanism using their home organization credentials. This federation facilitates seamless login experiences across various platforms, including MyCSC, SD Apply, CSC accounts, and the cPouta web interface, among others. HAKA is integrated with OpenID Connect for Puhti login and supports access to LUMI for users with a Finnish allocation.\n\nAs a federation, HAKA allows users from member organizations to log into CSC services, such as Puhti, and external services like Funet FileSender without the need for additional accounts.

This system is not only a cornerstone for accessing educational and research resources but also supports authentication for various applications, including SD Desktop and SD Connect.\n\nIn summary, HAKA stands as the identity federation of Finnish universities, polytechnics, and research institutions, offering a unified and secure authentication framework.
