{"result": "PLUMED is an open-source library designed for free energy calculations and enhanced sampling in molecular systems. It seamlessly integrates with some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) engines, including GROMACS, for which it provides additional functionalities through command-line tools. Developed by a community, PLUMED is available under CSC's module tree, making it accessible for a wide range of scientific research purposes. This compatibility with several MD codes positions PLUMED as a versatile tool in the field of computational chemistry and physics, facilitating advanced simulations and analyses.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
