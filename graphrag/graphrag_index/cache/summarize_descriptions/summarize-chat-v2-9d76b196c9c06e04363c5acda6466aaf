{"result": "RAHTI is a comprehensive container cloud service provided by CSC, designed to host applications and services in containers, making them accessible over the web. It is built on OpenShift OKD and utilizes OpenStack technologies, allowing for the deployment of a wide range of applications, including those requiring complex setups like MLflow tracking servers. RAHTI supports the deployment of Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster developed by RedHat, highlighting its robust infrastructure for containerized application management.\n\nThe service is known for its detailed project management capabilities, where OpenShift projects are mapped to CSC projects using the Description field of the OpenShift project. This mapping facilitates the management of resources, including the application for resource quotas and the sharing of projects with others. Upon project closure, RAHTI sets the project pod quota to 0 and stops all workloads, ensuring efficient resource utilization and security.\n\nRAHTI offers unique features such as the ability to set up HTTP redirection using web servers like nginx, and it provides a wildcard SSL certificate for DNS names under the subdomain `*.2.rahtiapp.fi`, managing the certificate renewal and installation process. The service operates with a shared outgoing IP address, necessitating strong security measures, especially for database access. This is critical when using MongoDB as a backend for FireWorks or connecting databases to CSC supercomputers like Puhti/Mahti, with RAHTI noted for its complexity in these connections.\n\nThe platform is designed to handle common cloud service issues, including DDoS attacks, SSL certificates, and SSH key problems, ensuring a secure environment for users' applications and services. RAHTI records all usage without user information, indicating a focus on privacy and a lack of detailed usage tracking.\n\nRAHTI provides tutorials on deploying applications, managing Docker Hub credentials, caching images, and data transfer, making it a valuable resource for users at various skill levels. It supports two versions, Rahti 1 and Rahti 2, each offering different features and configurations, such as TLS support and unique egress IPs, catering to diverse user needs.\n\nIn summary, RAHTI by CSC is a versatile and secure container cloud service that supports the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications across a cluster of servers. Its comprehensive features, including project management, security measures, and educational resources, make it a preferred choice for hosting applications and services in containers.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
