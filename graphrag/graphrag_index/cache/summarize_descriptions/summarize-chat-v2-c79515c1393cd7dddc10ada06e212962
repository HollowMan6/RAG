{"result": "Rahti 1 is a comprehensive container cloud service provided by CSC, specifically designed for open research and education in Finnish universities and polytechnics. It operates as part of a proxy setup, configured to relay requests to Rahti 2, and hosts an internal registry that considers images over 1GB as very big, with a maximum image size limit of 5GB. As a platform running on OKD, Rahti 1 offers scalable and fault-tolerant application deployment, making it an ideal solution for computing projects that require container technology and orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nThis service is notable for its project creation and management capabilities within OpenShift, offering resources and tutorials to support users in leveraging container technology effectively. Rahti 1 can be managed using command line tools such as OpenShift's oc tool or Kubernetes' kubectl tool, with specific features for OpenShift available when using the oc tool. Despite not natively supporting GPUs, Rahti 1 allows access through custom device plugins, with specific handling for Nvidia GPUs.\n\nFor network traffic, Rahti 1 supports HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports, utilizes HAProxy load balancers, and provides pre-created domain names with valid TLS certificates. It also offers local ephemeral storage solutions, utilizing RAID-0 SSD storage for the fastest filesystem available, though users must note that data is lost when the Pod is killed or restarted. Additionally, Rahti 1 supports templating service deployment code for re-use and lists default templates bundled with OKD in its Service Catalog.\n\nFrom a billing perspective, Rahti 1 consumes CSC Billing Units, with this policy starting from 1.02.2020. This platform represents a significant resource for the Finnish academic community, offering a robust set of features for deploying and managing containerized applications and services.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
