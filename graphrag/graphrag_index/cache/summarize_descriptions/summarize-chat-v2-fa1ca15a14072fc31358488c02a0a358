{"result": "PLUMED is an open-source library and set of tools designed for enhanced sampling methods in molecular dynamics (MD). It is specifically developed to facilitate free energy calculations within molecular systems. PLUMED operates by integrating with some of the most popular molecular dynamics engines, thereby extending their functionalities. This integration is notably achieved through its compatibility with several MD codes, including GROMACS, which it enhances through additional command-line tools. Available under the CSC's module tree, PLUMED stands out as a community-developed resource, offering its capabilities to researchers and scientists engaged in computational molecular studies.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
