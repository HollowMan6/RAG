{"result": "CRYPT4GH is a versatile encryption tool designed specifically for the secure handling of sensitive data, particularly human genetic data, in accordance with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards. Developed by CSC (IT Center for Science in Finland), CRYPT4GH serves a dual purpose of encrypting and decrypting files, making it an essential utility for researchers and professionals dealing with sensitive research data. It supports operations such as encryption, decryption, and key generation, utilizing both public and private keys to ensure secure data transfer.\n\nThis application is capable of encrypting files up to 100 GB, making it suitable for datasets containing large amounts of files, including those downloaded from SD Connect. It is specifically recommended for securing files before their export or upload to Finnish FEGA, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected throughout its lifecycle. CRYPT4GH is compatible with CSC Sensitive Data Services and is mentioned as a method for encrypting data formats within these services. It allows for encryption with several public keys, highlighting its flexibility and adaptability to various security needs.\n\nFiles encrypted by CRYPT4GH bear a `.c4gh` extension, signifying their secure status. The tool is not only recommended by CSC for encrypting data in various formats but is also an asymmetric encryption tool endorsed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health for encrypting large datasets. Its integration with secure data transfer methods, such as direct sending with SFTP after encryption with the CSC public key, underscores its utility in a wide range of data security contexts.\n\nIn summary, CRYPT4GH is a comprehensive encryption solution developed by CSC, adhering to GA4GH standards for the secure encryption and sharing of human genetic and other sensitive data. Its capabilities extend to generating encryption keys, encrypting files for secure upload and analysis, and decrypting data files encrypted by SD Connect, making it an indispensable tool for researchers and organizations handling sensitive information.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
