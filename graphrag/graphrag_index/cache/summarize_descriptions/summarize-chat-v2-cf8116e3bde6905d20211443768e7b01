{"result": "POUTA is a comprehensive cloud service platform provided by CSC - IT Center for Science, primarily catering to Finnish research and educational institutions, as well as offering services for commercial purposes. It operates on the OpenStack cloud computing infrastructure, providing a wide range of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions. These include the provisioning of virtual machine instances, cloud computing resources, storage options, and network configuration capabilities. POUTA is designed to support various computing needs, from deploying web applications to processing sensitive data, particularly through its ePouta variant which offers virtual servers with full control over the computing environment.\n\nPOUTA's offerings encompass a broad spectrum of functionalities such as image and volume snapshot management, instance and volume resizing, and the ability to create, convert, upload, and share virtual machine images. It supports both CPU-based and limited GPU resources for applications, allowing users to specify GPU needs. For data management, POUTA provides temporary and longer-term storage solutions, including persistent volumes and a CEPH cluster, ensuring data persistence beyond the life of a virtual machine.\n\nThe platform is accessible through a web UI for managing cloud resources like shared buckets and offers a secure way to manage application credentials via role-specific and time-limited tokens. POUTA emphasizes security in its infrastructure, providing options for network and router settings configuration, and requires users to manage virtual machines, network configurations, and user accounts diligently.\n\nBilling in POUTA is calculated in Billing Units (BUs) for both academic and commercial customers, with a specific usage policy and billing system in place. It offers virtual machine service orchestration via OpenStack Heat, and its services are accessible through OpenStack APIs, covering compute, VM images, authentication, object storage, block storage, and networking. POUTA's cloud services include cPouta and ePouta, which offer flexibility and resources for application development and deployment, with a lifecycle for virtual machines that impacts billing and resource usage.\n\nIn summary, POUTA is a versatile cloud service platform that provides a wide array of computing resources and services, designed to meet the diverse needs of its users, from academic research to commercial applications, emphasizing control, security, and flexibility in its offerings.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
