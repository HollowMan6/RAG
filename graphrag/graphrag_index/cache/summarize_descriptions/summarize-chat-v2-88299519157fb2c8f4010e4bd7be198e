{"result": "MATLAB Parallel Server is a service designed to enhance computational capabilities by allowing users to run parallel MATLAB code on the Puhti cluster. It facilitates the process of sending work as a batch job from a local MATLAB installation directly to Puhti. This service supports extensive computational tasks by enabling the use of up to 500 computing cores simultaneously. Through MATLAB Parallel Server, users can significantly expand their computational resources beyond the limitations of a local setup, optimizing the efficiency and speed of data processing and analysis tasks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
