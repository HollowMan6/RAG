{"result": "CRYPT4GH is a versatile encryption tool designed specifically for the secure handling of sensitive data, particularly human genetic data, in accordance with the standards set by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). Developed by CSC (IT Center for Science in Finland), CRYPT4GH serves a dual purpose of encrypting and decrypting files, making it an essential utility for researchers and professionals dealing with sensitive research data. It employs asymmetric key-based encryption, allowing users to encrypt files using public keys before transferring them securely, for instance, via SFTP. This tool is particularly noted for its compatibility with CSC Sensitive Data Services and is recommended by CSC for encrypting data in various formats, including those for secure upload to Finnish FEGA and for securing files downloaded from SD Connect.\n\nCRYPT4GH is capable of handling large datasets, supporting the encryption of files up to 100 GB for secure upload and analysis. It generates encryption keys and decrypts data when necessary, facilitating secure data transfer utilizing both public and private keys. The tool is designed to work with files having a `.c4gh` extension, indicating its specialized use in the encryption and decryption process. Despite its niche application, CRYPT4GH's importance is underscored by its recommendation by both the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health and CSC for encrypting large datasets and securing sensitive data files before export.\n\nIn summary, CRYPT4GH stands out as an encryption utility tailored for the secure management of sensitive genetic data and research data across various formats. Its development by CSC underscores its significance in the field of genomics and health research, providing a reliable method for encrypting and decrypting large amounts of files, thereby ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data in compliance with GA4GH standards.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
