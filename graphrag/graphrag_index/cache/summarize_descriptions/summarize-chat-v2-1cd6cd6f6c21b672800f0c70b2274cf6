{"result": "The \"REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED\" error is an alert generated by the SSH client when it detects that the key stored in its known hosts file for a virtual machine (VM) does not match the key presented by the VM during a connection attempt. This discrepancy suggests a possible security risk with SSH connections, as it could indicate that the VM is not the server the client was expecting to connect to, potentially due to a man-in-the-middle attack or other security compromise. This error serves as a warning to users that the integrity of their connection may be at risk.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
