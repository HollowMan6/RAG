{"result": "CRYPT4GH is a comprehensive encryption tool designed specifically for the encryption and sharing of human genetic data, adhering to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards. Developed by CSC (IT Center for Science in Finland), CRYPT4GH serves a dual purpose of generating encryption keys and decrypting data when necessary, making it an essential application for researchers handling sensitive data. It supports encrypting files up to 100 GB, facilitating secure upload and analysis of large datasets, and is particularly adept at handling files with a `.c4gh` extension. \n\nThis tool stands out for its use of asymmetric encryption, recommended by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health for encrypting large datasets, and is compatible with CSC Sensitive Data Services. It is designed to encrypt and decrypt files, utilizing public and private keys to ensure secure data transfer. CRYPT4GH supports operations like encryption, decryption, and key generation, based on the GA4GH cryptographic standard. It is an encryption utility recommended by CSC not only for encrypting data in various formats but also for securing sensitive data files before export, including its use within CSC's sensitive data services and before upload to Finnish FEGA.\n\nCRYPT4GH's capability to encrypt files for secure analysis and its recommendation by CSC for encrypting sensitive research data underscores its importance in the field of genomics and health research. Its ability to handle datasets containing large amounts of files and its compatibility with several public keys for encryption make it a versatile and secure choice for researchers worldwide.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
