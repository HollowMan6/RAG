{"result": "OpenACC is a programming standard and model for parallel computing, specifically developed to simplify the coding process for systems with accelerators, such as GPUs. It is a user-driven, directive-based, performance-portable parallel programming model, aimed at assisting scientists and engineers in porting their codes across a wide variety of heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC) hardware platforms. OpenACC is characterized by its simplicity in coding for accelerators and is supported by the Cray Fortran compiler in the Cray Compiler Environment (CCE) for Fortran, although it is not supported by the C/C++ compilers. This specification is designed to facilitate the programming of heterogeneous CPU/GPU systems, making it a valuable tool for developers working in the field of parallel computing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
