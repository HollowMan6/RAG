{"result": "RAHTI is a comprehensive container cloud service provided by CSC, designed to host applications and make them accessible over the web. It is based on OpenShift OKD and utilizes OpenStack technologies, allowing for the deployment of applications, including databases and machine learning models, in a secure and scalable environment. RAHTI supports the deployment of Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster developed by RedHat, offering a platform that is particularly suitable for applications requiring database connectivity, provided that the application is also deployed within RAHTI.\n\nThis service is noted for its complexity, especially when connecting from CSC's supercomputers, Puhti and Mahti, but it offers tutorials on deploying applications, managing Docker hub credentials, caching images, and data transfer to assist users. RAHTI allows for the creation of virtual applications based on container images and provides tools for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of these applications. It supports two versions, Rahti 1 and Rahti 2, each with different features and configurations, including TLS support and unique egress IPs.\n\nRAHTI projects are mapped to CSC projects using the Description field of the OpenShift project, and upon project closure, the project pod quota is set to 0, and all workloads are stopped. The service uses a shared outgoing IP address, requiring strong security measures, especially for database access. It deals with issues like DDoS attacks, SSL certificates, and SSH key problems, providing a wildcard SSL certificate for DNS names under the subdomain `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` and manages the certificate renewal and installation.\n\nThe platform is also capable of setting up HTTP redirection using web servers like nginx and allows users to manage projects, apply for resource quotas, and share projects with others. RAHTI has its own billing rates and records all use without user information, indicating a lack of detailed usage tracking. It is a versatile service that offers a web user interface accessible post-setup, making it a suitable choice for deploying a wide range of applications, from web services to MLflow tracking servers.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
