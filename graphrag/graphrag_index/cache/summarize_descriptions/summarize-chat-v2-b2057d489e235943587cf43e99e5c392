{"result": "C/C++ are programming languages that typically require an extension for development in Visual Studio Code. However, there is a contradiction in the provided information regarding the availability and installation process of this extension on LUMI. On one hand, it is stated that extensions for C/C++ are installed by default in Visual Studio Code on LUMI, suggesting no additional steps are needed for users to begin development. On the other hand, another description indicates that for C/C++ development in Visual Studio Code, users must manually download and install the extension due to its unavailability in the extensions tab. To resolve this contradiction and provide a coherent summary, it's essential to clarify that while C/C++ support might come pre-installed in some configurations of Visual Studio Code on LUMI, users should verify the availability of these extensions in their setup. If the extensions are not present, they will need to manually download and install them to proceed with C/C++ development.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
