{"result": "KAIVOS.CSC.FI is a MySQL database server provided by CSC (IT Center for Science in Finland) specifically designed for data import and export. This database service is accessible exclusively through CSC's computing servers, namely Puhti and Mahti. Users can manage and store data efficiently on Kaivos, but direct access from outside the CSC computing environment is restricted. However, it can be made visible to a local computer through the use of port forwarding and an SSH tunnel, enabling secure remote access.
