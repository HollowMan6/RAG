{"result": "CPEAOCC is a module within the LUMI software stack designed to serve as a comprehensive toolchain equivalent to Cray's PrgEnv-aocc. It is specifically tailored for compiling software on the LUMI supercomputer, utilizing cray-mpich for message passing interface capabilities and Cray LibSci for advanced mathematical library functions. CPEAOCC stands out as a crucial component in the LUMI stack by offering a replacement for the traditional PrgEnv-aocc, incorporating necessary workarounds for known issues, such as the aocc/3.1.0 module bug identified in version 21.12. This ensures that users have a seamless and efficient experience when compiling their software on LUMI, leveraging the best available tools and libraries to optimize performance and reliability.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
