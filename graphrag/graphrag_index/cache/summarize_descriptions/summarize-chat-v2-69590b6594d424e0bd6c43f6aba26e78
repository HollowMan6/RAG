{"result": "Small is a partition within CSC's computing resources, specifically designed for jobs that require fewer resources, potentially offering faster access to computing time. It operates as a Slurm partition where billing is based on the number of allocated cores or memory usage. This computing configuration, offered by CSC, features 4 cores and 15 GiB of memory, making it suitable for small or memory-intensive jobs. Additionally, Small serves as a partition in LUMI, tailored for tasks that can benefit from longer run times on a few nodes. This setup is ideal for users who need to run smaller-scale computations or those with applications that are memory-intensive but do not require the extensive computational power of larger partitions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
