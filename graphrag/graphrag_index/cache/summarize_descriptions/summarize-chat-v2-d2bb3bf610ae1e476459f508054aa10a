{"result": "MPI, or Message Passing Interface, is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. It is a central standard for parallel programming in distributed computing environments, enabling efficient communication in parallel computing environments. MPI jobs involve running parallel programs across multiple nodes, where each task in an MPI-based batch job has its own memory allocation. This system is used for building parallel applications in various contexts, including but not limited to Fortran MPI programs, hybrid MPI+OpenMP jobs, and launching MPI \"hello world\" applications with tools like gdb4hpc. It is notably utilized in environments such as Mahti for developing parallel applications. MPI stands as a cornerstone for researchers and developers in the field of parallel computing, offering a robust framework for executing complex computations across multiple computing nodes efficiently and effectively.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
