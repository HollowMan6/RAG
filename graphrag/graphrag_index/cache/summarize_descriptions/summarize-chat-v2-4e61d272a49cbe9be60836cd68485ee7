{"result": "Rahti 2 is a comprehensive container cloud service platform provided by CSC, designed for computing projects and based on the OpenShift distribution of Kubernetes. It utilizes Linux as its operating system, ensuring a robust and secure environment for container orchestration. Rahti 2 is specifically tailored for applications requiring scalable and fault-tolerant deployment, running on OKD to offer a wide range of cloud service capabilities, including container technology and orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nThis platform supports a variety of operations such as data storage, backup solutions, and database hosting, but it does not support non-HTTP traffic from external sources. Rahti 2 allows for the creation of projects, user and group access management, and project deletion functionalities, making it a versatile environment for managing computing resources. It includes an internal registry for images, which can be deployed using the image stream option, and provides local ephemeral (temporal) storage solutions utilizing RAID-1 SSD storage local to the node, offering the fastest filesystem available in Rahti 2.\n\nRahti 2 is designed with security and efficiency in mind, not running images as root to avoid permission denied errors for containers expecting root access. It supports automatic horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU and Memory consumption and allows the use of a wildcard certificate for `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` DNS names. The platform supports HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports for incoming traffic, uses HAProxy load balancers for managing incoming virtual IP traffic, and is protected against DDoS attacks with specific timeout settings for the HAProxy router image.\n\nNetworking in Rahti 2 uses IPv4 and is organized into Namespaces or Projects, with isolated VLANs for each namespace via Network Policies. It supports internal UDP traffic for Pod to Pod communications within the same namespace but does not allow external UDP connections, while also supporting HTTP/HTTPS for Routes and TCP ports for oc port-forwarding. The platform provides a web interface for users to interact with Pods, including opening terminals to Running Pods, and uses a default IP to connect pods to external networks, offering LoadBalancer services for exposing services to the internet.\n\nData can be stored using either a persistent volume or an object storage service, with a change in behavior regarding volume creation where the volume is only created when mounted for the first time. This ensures that a new persistent volume remains in \"Pending\" until any Pod mounts it, addressing efficiency and resource utilization. Rahti 2's internal registry has a maximum image size", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
