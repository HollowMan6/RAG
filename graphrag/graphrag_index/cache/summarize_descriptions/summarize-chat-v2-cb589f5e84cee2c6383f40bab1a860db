{"result": "RAHTI is a comprehensive container cloud service provided by CSC, designed to support the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications and services. Based on OpenShift OKD and developed by RedHat, RAHTI integrates OpenShift and OpenStack technologies, offering a robust platform for users to host applications, including web services and machine learning models, making them accessible over the web. It supports the deployment of Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster, allowing for the creation of virtual applications based on container images.\n\nRAHTI is suitable for a wide range of applications, from deploying databases—provided the application requiring database connectivity is also deployed within RAHTI—to setting up MLflow tracking servers. It features a web user interface accessible post-setup, facilitating the deployment process and management of containers. The platform is known for its complexity, especially when connecting from CSC's supercomputers, Puhti and Mahti, but offers tutorials on deploying applications, managing Docker hub credentials, caching images, and data transfer to assist users.\n\nThe service operates with a project pod quota set to 0, meaning all workloads are stopped upon project closure, ensuring efficient resource use. Projects within RAHTI are mapped to CSC projects using the Description field of the OpenShift project, and it has its own billing rates. RAHTI uses a shared outgoing IP address, necessitating strong security measures, especially for database access. It addresses common cloud service issues like DDoS attacks, SSL certificates, and SSH key problems, providing a wildcard SSL certificate for DNS names under the subdomain `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` and manages the certificate renewal and installation.\n\nRAHTI supports two versions, Rahti 1 and Rahti 2, each offering different features and configurations, including TLS support and unique egress IPs. It allows for the setting up of HTTP redirection using web servers like nginx and provides a platform for users to manage projects, apply for resource quotas, and share projects with others. Despite its comprehensive usage tracking, RAHTI records all use without user information, indicating a focus on privacy and security.\n\nIn summary, RAHTI by CSC is a versatile and secure container cloud service that supports a wide range of application deployments, offering detailed guidance and tools for deployment, maintenance, and scaling, while ensuring strong security measures and privacy standards.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
