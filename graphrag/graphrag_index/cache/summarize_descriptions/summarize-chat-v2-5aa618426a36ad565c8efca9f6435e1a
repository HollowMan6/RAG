{"result": "SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol designed for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. It enables a secure connection between computers, facilitating secure data transfer, remote system access, and management over an insecure network. SSH is widely used for securely logging into various systems, such as Puhti, Mahti, Kvasi, and CSC, over a network. It requires port 22 to be open for ingress traffic to establish a connection.\n\nSSH is essential for securely connecting to virtual machines (VMs) and is commonly mentioned in the context of troubleshooting login issues, security updates, and specifically the Terrapin vulnerability affecting systems like Puhti and Mahti. It also supports tunneling, including X11 for remote graphics, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of secure network services.\n\nFurthermore, SSH is the command utility that enables secure connections to remote servers, such as the Puhti supercomputer, and can be specified as the remote shell for rsync transfers. It is also a Linux tool used for secure remote login from one computer to another, highlighting its importance in secure communications and access across various platforms and systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
