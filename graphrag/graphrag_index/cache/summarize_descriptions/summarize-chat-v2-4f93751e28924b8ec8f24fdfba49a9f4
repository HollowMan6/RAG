{"result": "NVME, standing for Non-Volatile Memory Express, is a specification for accessing non-volatile storage media attached via the PCI Express (PCIe) bus. It is an interface protocol designed for high-speed storage solutions, particularly utilized in computing environments like Puhti. NVME represents a fast local drive technology, providing a local disk storage option on Puhti specifically for intensive I/O jobs. This technology is available as temporary local storage accessible on login nodes and to jobs on some compute nodes within CSC's computing infrastructure, indicating its critical role in supporting I/O-intensive applications. It serves as a vital resource for storing data temporarily during job execution, highlighting its importance in facilitating efficient and effective computing processes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
