{"result": "NVME, standing for Non-Volatile Memory Express, is a specification for accessing non-volatile storage media attached via the PCI Express (PCIe) bus. It represents a type of fast storage solution utilized in computing environments, notably within CSC's computing infrastructure, such as Puhti. NVME is highlighted as a local disk storage option on Puhti, specifically designed for intensive I/O jobs. It serves as temporary local storage accessible on login nodes and to jobs on some compute nodes, indicating its role as a crucial technology for managing numerous files or performing intensive I/O operations efficiently.\n\nAs an interface protocol, NVME facilitates high-speed access to storage solutions, making it an ideal choice for environments requiring quick data access and temporary storage during job execution. In Puhti, NVME-based local temporary scratch directories are provided, offering a solution tailored for applications that are I/O-intensive. This fast local drive technology is part of the computing resources aimed at enhancing the performance and efficiency of data handling processes, thereby supporting a wide range of computational tasks and applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
