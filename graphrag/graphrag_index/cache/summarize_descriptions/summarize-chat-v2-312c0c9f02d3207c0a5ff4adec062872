It is essential for accessing the CSC license server and the Maestro license from the Schrödinger website, especially when users are outside the network. Beyond providing vital access to these resources, FUNET also offers significant value to its member organizations through additional services. One notable service includes the provision of free SSL certificates to member organizations that have signed a contract to use the certificate service.
