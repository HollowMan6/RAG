{"result": "OpenMPI is an open-source Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation designed for high performance computing across various computational architectures and environments. It serves as a high-performance message passing library, facilitating parallel computing on CSC servers, including Mahti, and is a critical prerequisite for running specific software modules like SOFI3D on Puhti. As an implementation of the MPI standard, OpenMPI supports a wide range of computing environments and networking technologies, alongside various compiler suites for building MPI applications. This versatility and its commitment to high performance make OpenMPI a foundational tool in the realm of parallel computing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
