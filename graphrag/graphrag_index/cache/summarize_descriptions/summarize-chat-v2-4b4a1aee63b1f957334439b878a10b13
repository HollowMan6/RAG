{"result": "CRYPT4GH is a versatile encryption tool specifically designed for the secure handling of sensitive data, including human genetic information, in accordance with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards. Developed by CSC (IT Center for Science in Finland), CRYPT4GH serves a dual purpose of encrypting and decrypting files, making it particularly useful for datasets containing large volumes of files. It is capable of encrypting files up to 100 GB, facilitating secure upload and analysis, and is compatible with files bearing the `.c4gh` extension.\n\nThis application stands out for its ability to generate encryption keys, which is essential for both encrypting and decrypting files, ensuring that sensitive data can be securely shared and analyzed. CRYPT4GH is highly recommended by CSC for encrypting sensitive research data across various formats, highlighting its adaptability and importance in securing sensitive data files before export. It is also compatible with CSC Sensitive Data Services, underscoring its utility in encrypting data for secure storage and analysis within CSC's infrastructure.\n\nOne of the key features of CRYPT4GH is its capability to allow encryption with several public keys, which enhances its functionality within CSC's sensitive data services. This feature is particularly beneficial for researchers and organizations dealing with large datasets, as it simplifies the process of securing data before upload to Finnish FEGA and other sensitive data repositories. By providing a robust solution for the encryption and sharing of sensitive data, CRYPT4GH plays a critical role in the secure management of genetic and other sensitive data, adhering to international standards and best practices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
