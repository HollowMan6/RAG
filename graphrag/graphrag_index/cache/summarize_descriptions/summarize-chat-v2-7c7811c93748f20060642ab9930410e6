{"result": "BRAKER is a software tool designed for eukaryotic genome annotation, which is mentioned on its home page, indicating its relevance in computing or bioinformatics. It utilizes both genomic and RNA-Seq data to automatically generate full gene structure annotations in novel genomes. This process is based on the integration of the GeneMark-ET R2 and AUGUSTUS pipelines, making BRAKER an automatic genome annotator specifically tailored for eukaryotes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
