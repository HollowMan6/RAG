The guide\ndiscusses LLMs and GPU memory, fine-tuning and inference. The linked\nGitHub repository has examples for fine-tuning popular models on Puhti\nand Mahti. LUMI examples and more in-depth topics will be added later.\n\n## New guide for getting started with supercomputing at CSC, 24.7.2024\n\nWe wrote a brand new guide for\n[getting started with supercomputing at CSC](../tutorials/hpc-quick.md),\nin which we help users find the most suitable resources for their needs and\nthe most effective way of using them. The guide is useful for both total HPC\nbeginners as well as more experienced practitioners who are nonetheless new to\nthe CSC computing environment.\n\n## New guide for using Python effectively on CSC supercomputers, 27.6.2024\n\nWe have reworked our Python documentation. Instructions on installing packages,\nusing different development environments and running parallel jobs have been\nupdated and are now found under a guide called\n[*Using Python on CSC supercomputers*](../tutorials/python-usage-guide.md).\n\nThe [Python application page](../../apps/python.md) has been simplified\nto purely describe the different Python implementations in our computing\nenvironment. As a new addition there is a [list of our pre-made Python\nenvironment modules](../../apps/python.md#pre-installed-python-environments)\nalong with their intended purposes and included packages.\n\n## Spring School on Computational Chemistry materials available for self learning, 10.5.2024\n\nThe [School materials](https://zenodo.org/records/11172973) cover intro to molecular\ndynamics and electronic structure theory lectures and hands-on exercises, and machine\nlearning for molecular and material use cases. You can also access the Notebooks directly\nvia the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi) (once logged in, select \"Jupyter for\ncourses\" and the desired course module.)\n\n## How to run GROMACS efficiently on LUMI training materials published, 6.2.2024\n\nThe materials from the workshop \"How to run GROMACS efficiently on LUMI\" are\nnow [available in the Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/10610643).\n\n## Access CSC newsletter and mailing list archives from Docs CSC, 13.12.2023\n\nThe _Contact_ page has been updated to include a selection of [CSC newsletter and mailing list archives](../contact.md#archives).\nLook here if you're having trouble finding an email or a newsletter sent to you by CSC!\n\n## New way to provide feedback on pages in Docs CSC, 30.10.2023\n\nDocs CSC now features feedback buttons at the bottom of every page.\n\n>![Feedback buttons](../../img/whats-new/feedback-buttons.png)\n\nThe buttons present a quick and easy way of providing feedback on a particular page.\n\n## Changes in navigation on Docs CSC, 22.02.2023\n\nSome changes have been made to how the sidebar navigation works on Docs CSC. Many of the sections\nhave had pages like _Overview_, _Contents_ or other index-like pages moved under the section\nheadings themselves, which are now links:\n\n| Before | After |\n|-|-|\n| ![Navigation before changes](../../img/whats-new/nav-before.png) | ![Navigation after changes](../../img/whats-new/nav-after.png) |\n\n## New guide for working with Earth Observation data, 19.01.2023\n\nThe [Earth Observation guide](../tutorials/gis/eo_guide.md) aims to help researchers to work with Earth Observation (EO) data by giving an overview of available data and tools for raster data based EO tasks. The focus of the guide is on using CSC computing resources for EO data processing and analysis. However, it also includes some information of non CSC related options for processing and download of EO data.\n\n## Training materials and sources from CSC and partners, 12.12.2022\n\nCheck out this [concise table of training materials](../training-material.md#training-materials-and-sources-from-csc-and-partners)\navailable from us and our partners on many topics related to doing science\nwith computers.\n\n## A new visual appearance for Docs CSC, 18.8.2022\n\nIn an effort to maintain a coherent style across CSC websites, Docs CSC has gained a\nrefreshed visual appearance.\n\n## Documentation on custom Jupyter notebooks for your courses, 13.6.2022\n\nOur documentation on [custom Jupyter notebooks for your courses](https://github.com/CSCfi/Jupyter_www_puhti)\nhas been extended. Trainers or course organisers can leverage the power\nof supercomputers for their courses in easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks at CSC.\nUsing custom notebooks in courses is very user-friendly and scalable for remote\nor onsite courses.\n\n## Documentation on High-throughput computing and workflows updated, 6.6.2022\n\nOur documentation on [high-throughput computing and workflows](../../computing/running/throughput.md)\nhas been updated and extended. The page contains important instructions and\nguidelines on how to run workflows and tasks with heavy IO patterns in CSC's\ncomputing environment. By carefully selecting the most appropriate technology\nstack, your jobs will idle less in the queue, IO-operations will be more\nefficient and the performance of the whole HPC system will remain stable and\nfast for all users.
