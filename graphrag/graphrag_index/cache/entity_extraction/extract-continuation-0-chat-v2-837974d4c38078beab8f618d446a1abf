[Convert Docker containers to Apptainer image files](../../computing/containers/creating.md#converting-a-docker-container),\n   or\n2. Build an Apptainer image entirely from scratch.\n\nThis tutorial focuses on the latter scenario, with further information\navailable on the\n[Apptainer website](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/build_a_container.html).\n\n## Containers as distinct environments\n\nOne can think of containers as distinct environments of their own. For example,\nthe Linux distribution used in the container may differ from that of the host\nenvironment where the container is executed. Apptainer images also have an\ninternal file system that is not visible outside the container. Likewise, most\nof the host environment will not be visible to a container unless explicitly\nspecified. Selected folders on the host can be exposed to the container by\nusing\n[bind mounts](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/bind_paths_and_mounts.html).\n\nWhen planning the contents and configuration of an Apptainer container, a\ndecision needs to be made on whether specific installations should be done\nwithin the container or added as bind mounts. For example, certain dependencies\nmay already be present on the host. The container Linux distribution will\nnaturally affect this decision.\n\nFrequently, the environment variables used within a container *versus* the host\nenvironment will also differ (more on that below).\n\n## Preparing a definition file\n\nA definition file (with the extension `.def`) is a file containing the commands\nrequired to build the container. Examples of definition files used in CSC's\ncomputing environment can be found in our\n[singularity-recipes repository](https://github.com/CSCfi/singularity-recipes).\n\nA definition file is split into sections serving different purposes\n([see here for details](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/definition_files.html)).\nAt the very top of the file, one must provide a header specifying a bootstrap\nkeyword and a Linux distribution. For example, to create a header for an Ubuntu\n22.04 container, one would type:\n\n```dockerfile\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:22.04\n```\n\nThe choice of Linux distribution defines the types of commands used in the\ndefinition file. For example, a CentOS container would use commands such as\n`yum -y install`, whereas an Ubuntu container would use commands such as\n`apt-get -y install`.\n\nOther sections one can use include the following:\n\n* `%labels` (e.g. name and contact of the image maintainer).\n* `%files` (commands for copying external files into a specific location in the\n  container).\n* `%post` (section for software installation commands).\n* `%environment` (environment variables defined upon launching the container).\n\nNote that different sections can be added or left out depending on your needs.\nFor example, if you have no external files to include in the container, there\nis no need for a `%files` section.\n\n### A few words on environment variables\n\nEnvironment variables can be defined in both the `%post` and `%environment`\nsections. Those specified in the former may be useful during software\ninstallations, but unlike variables specified under the `%environment` section,\nthey will not be visible upon launching the container.\n\nIf you wish to specify environment variables on the host environment in a way\nthat is visible to the container, these must be preceded by `APPTAINERENV_`.\nVariables without this prefix will not be passed to the container.\n\n## Building a container\n\nBuilding an Apptainer container requires root (`sudo`) access. However, on CSC\nsupercomputers, where users do not have root privileges, you may use the\n[fakeroot](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/fakeroot.html) feature to\ncircumvent this requirement (with a few restrictions).\n[See our documentation on creating containers for more details](../../computing/containers/creating.md#building-a-container-without-sudo-access-on-puhti-and-mahti).\n\nAlternatively, you may use your own computer, or a virtual machine where you\nhave root access, to build a container image. One option is to use a\n[Pouta virtual machine](../../cloud/pouta/index.md). This enables one to\nspecify the type of environment used to build the image. Most of the time, the\nLinux distribution of the environment used to build the container will matter\nrelatively little. However, certain installations (e.g.\n[Nvidia CUDA drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html))\nhave strict version requirements with regard to kernel headers, meaning that\nthe distribution must effectively be matched between the environment for\ncontainer building, the container and the host.\n\nTo build a container using a definition file, one can simply run:\n\n```bash\nsudo apptainer build container.sif recipe.def\n```\n\nor without `sudo` using the `--fakeroot` option:\n\n```bash\napptainer build --fakeroot container.sif recipe.def\n```\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    In older versions of Linux the command may be `singularity` instead of\n    `apptainer`.\n\nIf everything is successful, this results in a container image (`.sif` file)\nthat can be moved to your computing environment of choice. The image file is\n*immutable*, meaning that it can not be modified after the build step. It is\nalso possible to create\n[writable sandbox directories](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/build_a_container.html#creating-writable-sandbox-directories)\nthat can be used for testing\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer, formerly known as Singularity, is a software platform for creating and running containers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC refers to a computing environment where Apptainer containers can be created and managed)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU<|>GEO<|>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS<|>GEO<|>CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free, enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA CUDA DRIVERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nvidia CUDA Drivers are software developed by Nvidia for computing on Nvidia graphics processing units)##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUTA VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta Virtual Machine refers to a cloud service provided by CSC for creating and managing virtual machines)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>DOCKER<|>Apptainer containers can be created by converting Docker containers<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>CSC<|>CSC provides platforms and documentation for creating Apptainer containers<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>LINUX<|>Apptainer containers can run on various Linux distributions<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>UBUNTU<|>Apptainer containers can be built using Ubuntu as a base Linux distribution<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>CENTOS<|>Apptainer containers can be built using CentOS as a base Linux distribution<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>NVIDIA CUDA DRIVERS<|>Building Apptainer containers may involve installing Nvidia CUDA Drivers<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>POUTA VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>Pouta Virtual Machines can be used to build Apptainer containers<|>6)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
