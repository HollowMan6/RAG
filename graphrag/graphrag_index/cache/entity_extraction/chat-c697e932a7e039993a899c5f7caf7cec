Instead of `gmx grompp`,\n    give `gmx_mpi grompp`.\n\n## License\n\nGROMACS is a free software available under LGPL, version 2.1.\n\n## Usage\n\nInitialize recommended version of GROMACS on Puhti or Mahti like this:\n\n```bash\nmodule purge\nmodule load gromacs-env\n```\n\nUse `module spider` to locate other versions. To load these modules, you need\nto first load required dependencies, which are shown with\n`module spider gromacs/<version>`. To access CSC's GROMACS modules on LUMI,\nremember to first run `module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles`.\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Please use the `-maxh` flag for `mdrun`. Setting this equal to or slightly\n    less than the requested time limit (in hours) will ensure that there's time\n    for your simulation to write a final checkpoint and end gracefully before\n    the scheduler terminates the job. If left unspecified, there's a chance\n    that the job will crash the node(s) it is running on. For general guidance\n    on managing long simulations, see the\n    [GROMACS manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/managing-simulations.html).\n\n### Notes about performance\n\n!!! warning \"Note\"\n    Please minimize unnecessary disk I/O – never run simulations using\n    `mdrun -v` (the verbose flag)!\n\nIt is important to setup the simulations properly to use resources efficiently.\nThe most important aspects to consider (in addition to avoiding `-v`) are:\n\n1. If you run in parallel, make a scaling test for each system – don't use more\n   cores/GPUs than is efficient. Scaling depends on many aspects of your system\n   and used algorithms, not just size.\n2. Use a recent version – there has been significant speedup and bug fixes over\n   the years. If you switch the major version, remember to check that the\n   results are comparable.\n3. For large jobs, use full nodes (multiples of 40 cores on Puhti or multiples\n   of 128 cores on Mahti), see examples below.\n4. Performance on GPUs depends on many factors and what calculations you\n   offload. Please consult the\n   [excellent ENCCS online materials](https://enccs.github.io/gromacs-gpu-performance/)\n   for a general overview, or the\n   [GROMACS on LUMI workshop materials](https://zenodo.org/records/10610643)\n   for how to run efficiently on LUMI-G.\n5. On LUMI-G it is important to make sure CPUs are bound to the correct GPUs to\n   minimize communication overhead. See examples below and\n   [LUMI Docs](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/distribution-binding/#gpu-binding)\n   for more information.\n\nFor a more complete description, consult the\n[mdrun performance checklist](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/mdrun-performance.html)\non the GROMACS page.\n\n### Puhti\n\n=== \"Serial batch script\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=small\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    ##SBATCH --mail-type=END # uncomment to get mail\n\n    # this script runs a 1 core gromacs job, requesting 15 minutes time\n\n    module purge\n    module load gromacs-env\n    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n\n    srun gmx_mpi mdrun -s topol -maxh 0.2\n    ```\n\n=== \"Parallel batch script\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=large\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    ##SBATCH --mail-type=END # uncomment to get mail\n\n    # this script runs an 80 core (2 full nodes) gromacs job, requesting 15 minutes time\n\n    module purge\n    module load gromacs-env\n    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n\n    srun gmx_mpi mdrun -s topol -maxh 0.2 -dlb yes\n    ```\n\n    !!! info \"Note\"\n        To avoid multinode parallel jobs spreading over more nodes than\n        necessary, don't use the `--ntasks` flag, but specify `--nodes` and\n        `--ntasks-per-node=40` to get full nodes.
