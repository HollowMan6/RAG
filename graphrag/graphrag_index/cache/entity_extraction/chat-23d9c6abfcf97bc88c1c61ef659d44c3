An Docker image is immutable, i.e. existing image file cannot be modified, but one can create a new layer to it & thus have a modified version of image suitable to him.\n\nDocker containers are the running instances of Docker images. To avoid confusions, lets have a quick walkthrough over Docker image & containers using cooking example:\n\n* Dockerfile could be regarded as the ingredients list.\n* Docker Images are ingredients mixed together.\n* Docker Container is cooked delicious meal: The final end product!\n\nTo better explain these analogies, let's follow some examples.\n\nFirst, in order to run a docker image one can use the docker client on the host machine (provided that it is installed):\n\n```sh\ndocker run -p 80:80 nginx\n```\n\nThis will, if the image is not cached locally, first pull (or download) the latest nginx image, then look for the predefined entry point, and finally a container is run. You can access and see the nginx welcome page through the address http://localhost:80  \nThe output will be something like:\n\n```sh\nUnable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from library/nginx\n31ce7ceb6d44: Pull complete\nf1359798dfe4: Pull complete\n4de1e0313830: Pull complete\n7745719004b6: Pull complete\n0f17732d34d5: Pull complete\n0eb0ed12e64c: Pull complete\n5836f8c1cebc: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:86e53c4c16a6a276b204b0fd3a8143d86547c967dc8258b3d47c3a21bb68d3c6\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest\n/docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration\n/docker-entrypoint.sh: Looking for shell scripts in /docker-entrypoint.d/\n/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh\n10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Getting the checksum of /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf\n10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Enabled listen on IPv6 in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf\n/docker-entrypoint.sh: Sourcing /docker-entrypoint.d/15-local-resolvers.envsh\n/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/20-envsubst-on-templates.sh\n/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/30-tune-worker-processes.sh\n/docker-entrypoint.sh: Configuration complete; ready for start up\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: using the \"epoll\" event method\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: nginx/1.25.3\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: built by gcc 12.2.0 (Debian 12.2.0-14)\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: OS: Linux 6.4.16-linuxkit\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE): 1048576:1048576\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker processes\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 29\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 30\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 31\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 32\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 33\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 34\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 35\n2023/11/08 10:27:14 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 36\n```\n\nThe name in this example is `nginx`, but as we can see, it is expanded first to `nginx:latest` and then to `library/nginx`, the different parts are:\n\n* If the domain name is not included, docker assumes it is default public docker registry, `docker.io`. But there are other registries, for example  `image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi` is Rahti 2's private docker registry.\n\n* Then it is the path for the image, in this case it is `/library`. Again docker is assuming it, this path is reserved to \"official base images\", or in other words common Linux distributions, from where other images are based on.\n\n* Next, you have the image name itself, `nginx`. There are a lot of other \"base images\" in `docker.io/library`, such as `ubuntu` or `alpine`.\n\n* Finally, it is the tag, `latest`. This is the default tag for an image, but an image can have any given name for a tag.
