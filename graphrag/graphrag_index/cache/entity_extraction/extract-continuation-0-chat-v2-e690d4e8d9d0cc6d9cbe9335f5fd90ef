It is a part of the CSC storage portfolio and can be accessed on the CSC servers as well as from anywhere on the internet. Allas can be used both for static research data that needs to be available for analysis and to collect and host cumulating or changing data. A CSC project is required to import data to Allas. Allas can be used to host data for as long as the CSC project is active.\n\nFrom the technical point of view, Allas is a modern object storage system. It comes with the _S3_ and _Swift_ interfaces on a _CEPH_ storage. In practice, this means that instead of files, the data is stored as objects in buckets. A bucket is a container for objects that may also include metadata describing the bucket.\n\nThe stored objects can be of any data type, such as images or compressed data files. In general, objects are similar to files. The object storage can be used for a variety of purposes. It has benefits but also limitations.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n * The object storage can handle practically any static data.\n * The data can be accessed from anywhere using the URL.\n * The data can have different levels of access control.\n * The data can have lifecycle policy set.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n * Specific tools are required to use the object storage. The object storage cannot be properly mounted for local disk-like usage. There are some tools that can do this, but they have their limitations. For example, _svfs_ can be used to mount _Swift_ as a file system, but it uses _FUSE_ which is slow.\n * It is unsuitable for files that change constantly during their lifetime (e.g. most SQL databases).\n * The data cannot be modified while it is in Allas. It must be downloaded to a server for processing, and the previous version replaced with a new one.\n * In case of swift protocol, files larger than 5 GB are divided into smaller segments. Normally, this is done automatically during the upload. See [Files larger than 5 GB](./using_allas/common_use_cases.md#files-larger-than-5-gb).\n\n## Billing and quotas\n\nAllas usage is based on CSC projects. All project members have equal access rights to the storage area that has been granted for the project. In practice, this means that if one project member uploads data to Allas, all other project members can also read, edit and delete the data. Allas itself does not store any information about who has uploaded the data to Allas.\n\nThe default quota for a new project is 10 TB, but that can be increased if needed. Allas is the preferred storage site for any large datasets in the CSC environment, so you should not hesitate to request a larger quota for Allas, if you work with larger data sets.\n\nTo increase your Allas quota, please send a request to: `servicedesk@csc.fi`\nIn the request, define what Allas project you are using, how large storage space is needed and what kind of data will be stored to Allas.\n\n\n**The default quotas for projects:**\n\n| Resource | Limit |\n| :-------- |:------- |\n| Storage amount | 10 TiB |\n| Buckets per project | 1 000 |\n| Objects per bucket | 500 000 |\n\nThe maximum for the \"Objects per bucket\" quota is 500 000. By exeeding the limit you might get your bucket in a situation where you can't make any operations. If you need more objects than this, please plan on spreading the objects across multiple buckets. Spreading data to multiple buckets will give a better performance whenever writing objects.\n\nStoring data in Allas consumes _billing units_. In Allas, billing is based on the amount of data stored. The rate is 1 BU/TiBh, i.e. 1 TB of data stored in Allas consumes 24 BU in a day and 8760 BU in a year.\n\nUnlike most other object storage providers, CSC does <u>not</u> charge for object storage network transfers or API calls.\n\n\n\n## Different ways to use Allas\n\nYou cannot mount Allas direcly to a computer. This means that in order to use Allas, you need software tools to access it. There are four main ways to access Allas:\n\n![Allas access clients](img/allas-access-flavors.png)\n\n1. In the CSC computing environment (Puhti and Mahti), there are ready-to-use tools provided by CSC to access Allas. These tools are mostly the same that can also be installed in any Linux environment, e.g. a virtual machine in cPouta or a local Linux server.\nIn the CSC computing environment, Allas should be used to store any data that needs to be preserved for longer than a few weeks. The supercomputer's own storage has a policy to delete idle data, so the data must be moved to Allas after computing. See [Computing disk environment](../../computing/disk.md)\n\n2. WWW access to Allas is provided by the web interface of the cPouta cloud environment [https://pouta.csc.fi](https://pouta.csc.fi). No special software is required to access Allas with a browser, making this the by far simplest way to access Allas. On the other hand, the browser user interface has a number of limitations compared to other clients, the most notable of which are lower performance and uploading/downloading only a single file at a time. Instructions for accessing and using Allas with a browser: [OpenStack Horizon web interface](./using_allas/web_client.md)\n\n3.
