This works as additional storage for the\nduration of the instance. This storage is not saved with the instance.\nThis storage **does not** get saved when you create a snapshot of an\nimage. It is not copied along with resizes or migrations. It is\nespecially important to note regarding the io.\\* flavors that the\nstorage is based on RAID0 arrays optimized for performance, providing\nno redundancy whatsoever. Regarding io.2.\\* flavors, the storage is based on RAID1, offering\nmore safety, avoiding the loss of files.\n\nThe ephemeral storage is visible as an additional disk to the virtual\nmachine (usually /dev/vdb). Depending on the image and metadata chosen\nwhen creating the virtual machine, the disk might be already formated\nas `vfat` and mounted in `/mnt`. If this is case and this fits your use\ncase, you can just start to use the disk.\n\nIf you need to format the disk with a different filesystem (or it is not\nformatted nor mounted), you can follow this procedure:\n\nFirst make sure that the volume is not mounted:\n\n    sudo umount /dev/vdb\n\nand that there is no entry in `/etc/fstab` for this disk:\n\n    cat /etc/fstab\n\nLook for a line containing `/dev/vdb` or `LABEL=EPHEMERAL`,\nand comment it out (adding `#` at the beginning of the line).\n\nNow you can continue to format and mount it. We are using ext4 in the example below:\n\n    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb\n    sudo mkdir /mnt/myephdisk\n    sudo mount /dev/vdb /mnt/myephdisk\n\nYou also need to add an entry in the /etc/fstab file on the\nmachine to make sure the disk gets mounted after a reboot:\n\n    sudo umount /mnt/myephdisk/\n    sudo e2label /dev/vdb EPHEMERAL\n    sudo bash -c 'echo \"LABEL=EPHEMERAL   /mnt/myephdisk   ext4  defaults,nofail 0 2 \" >> /etc/fstab'\n    sudo mount /mnt/myephdisk\n\nAfter the storage has been mounted, you need to change the ownership to be able to read and write data in it.\nIn the following command, we are assuming the username is cloud-user.\n\n    sudo chown cloud-user:cloud-user /mnt/myephdisk\n\nPlease note that some legacy flavors (tiny, mini, small, medium, large, fullnode) also\ncontained an ephemeral disk which was preformatted and mounted\nautomatically.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
