However, you can make the database visible to your own computer using your CSC user account and port forwarding through an _ssh tunnel_.\n\nIn linux and MacOSX machines an ssh tunnel from your local computer to `kaivos.csc.fi` via `puhti.csc.fi` can be done for example with the command:\n\n```bash\nssh -l csc_username -L 3306:kaivos.csc.fi:3306 puhti.csc.fi -N\n```\n\nThe `-N` option in the end of the connection command blocks the command shell after the connection is established. Once the connection is closed also the port forwarding becomes disabled. Note that the ssh command above uses your CSC user account and password, not the database user account.\n\nIn Windows machines you can use e.g. plink program to open the tunnel. [Plink](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) can only be used through the command prompt. Below is a sample command for using plink:\n\n```bash\nplink -L 3306:kaivos.csc.fi:3306 csc_username@puhti.csc.fi\n```\n\nThe tunneling commands above define that the communication to port 3306 (the default port of MySQL) in you local computer is transported to the MySQL port of `kaivos.csc.fi` through `puhti.csc.fi` server. As long as the connection to puhti.csc.fi is active the database in `kaivos.csc.fi` can be accessed from your local computer using the same MySQL commands as described above for Puhti (assuming that you have the MySQL client program installed in your local computer). The only difference compared to previous command examples is that the host section (`-h`) should now point to host `127.0.0.1` that refers to your local host, instead of `kaivos.csc.fi`.\n\nSo for example the syntax to open an interactive MySQL session would now be:\n\n```bash\nmysql -u db_user_account -p -h 127.0.0.1 --local database_name\n```\n\nAnd the syntax for `mysqlimport`:\n\n```bash\nmysqlimport -h 127.0.0.1 -u db_user_account --local --compress --password database_name input_file.table\n```\n\nIn the same way, you can make your databases visible in your local computer using locally installed graphical MySQL interfaces, like [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). The only major limitation with the port forwarding is that normally ssh tunnels are not very stable. You may need to reopen the ssh connection every now and then and you should not trust that the tunnel remains usable for several hours.\n\nFor the security reasons we recommend that you always close the ssh connection when you stop using the database.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A MySQL database accessible only through CSC's computing servers, Puhti and Mahti, but can be made visible to a local computer via port forwarding and an ssh tunnel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Represents the IT center for science in Finland, providing computing servers like Puhti and Mahti for accessing kaivos.csc.fi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI.CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of CSC's computing servers used to access kaivos.csc.fi through an ssh tunnel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI.CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another computing server provided by CSC for accessing kaivos.csc.fi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH TUNNEL<|>EVENT<|>A method for securing remote shell connections with port forwarding, used here to access MySQL databases on kaivos.csc.fi from a local computer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSQL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A relational database management system used here in the context of accessing databases on kaivos.csc.fi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSQL WORKBENCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A graphical interface for MySQL databases, mentioned as a tool for making databases visible on a local computer)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>CSC<|>Kaivos.csc.fi is a database that can be accessed through CSC's computing servers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>PUHTI.CSC.FI<|>Kaivos.csc.fi can be accessed via an ssh tunnel through Puhti.csc.fi<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>MAHTI.CSC.FI<|>Kaivos.csc.fi can also be accessed through Mahti.csc.fi, another CSC computing server<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH TUNNEL<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>An ssh tunnel is used to securely access kaivos.csc.fi from a local computer<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH TUNNEL<|>PUHTI.CSC.FI<|>An ssh tunnel through Puhti.csc.fi is a method for accessing kaivos.csc.fi<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYSQL<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>MySQL is the database system used for kaivos.csc.fi<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYSQL WORKBENCH<|>MYSQL<|>MySQL Workbench is a graphical interface tool for MySQL databases, applicable for use with kaivos.csc.fi<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
