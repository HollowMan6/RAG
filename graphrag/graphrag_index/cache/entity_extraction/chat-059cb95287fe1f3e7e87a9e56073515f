This is the primary\ndisk of the virtual machine, also called root disk. Nevertheless, the space\navailable is typically limited and the lifetime of the data in it is limited by\nthe virtual machine, i.e., the data is erased once the virtual machine is\ndeleted. This article introduces the storage options available in CSC's cloud\nenvironment. Using the storage requires an account, a project, and a virtual\nmachine.\n\n## Ephemeral storage\n\nDepending on the chosen flavor, a virtual machine may have a certain amount of\nadditional local disk space, called **ephemeral storage** in the OpenStack\nterminology. This storage is visible on the virtual machine as a second hard\ndisk.\n\nThe main advantage of the ephemeral storage is performance, as the data is\nstored in the hard disk of the server where the virtual machine is running.\nNevertheless, the ephemeral storage is available only when the virtual machine\nis running. In addition, similarly to the data in the primary disk, the data in\nthe ephemeral storage is lost too when you delete the virtual machine. Given\nthat the data in the ephemeral storage is not replicated, you should not store\nany persistent data there, and the ephemeral storage should not be considered\nreliable.\n\nYou can find additional information on the\n[ephemeral storage page](ephemeral-storage.md).\n\n## Persistent volumes\n\nIf you are looking for a storage space which can be accessed like an additional\nhard disk, and which is not tied to a single virtual machine, you are looking\nfor **persistent volumes**. You can attach a persistent volume to a virtual\nmachine, and use it as you would use the ephemeral storage. Nevertheless, you\ncan also detach it from the virtual machine and attach it to another virtual\nmachine. In other words, you are free of deleting and recreating your virtual\nmachines using the persistent volume, as a persistent volume is not tied to the\nlifetime of a single virtual machine. Moreover, persistent volumes represent a\nreliable storage option as the data in them is replicated.\n\nYou can find additional information on the\n[persistent volumes page](persistent-volumes.md).\n\n## Object storage\n\nIn case you need a storage space where your data can be easily accessed over\nthe Internet, e.g., using URLs, **object storage** is the storage solution you\nare looking for. By using object storage, you are free to create and delete\nyour virtual machines as the object storage is not tied to any virtual machine.\nMoreover, your data is replicated, thus object storage represent a reliable\nstorage option.\n\nAt CSC, we offer Allas as our object storage solution.\nYou can find additional information on the\n[Allas page](../../data/Allas/index.md).\n\n## Snapshots\n\nSometimes you just want to have a backup copy of the data in a virtual machine\nor in a persistent volume. Alternatively, you might be interested to save the\ncurrent state of a virtual machine, so that you can start other virtual\nmachines cloning the same state. In these cases, you can use **snapshots**.\n\nYou can find additional information on the [snapshots page](snapshots.md).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
