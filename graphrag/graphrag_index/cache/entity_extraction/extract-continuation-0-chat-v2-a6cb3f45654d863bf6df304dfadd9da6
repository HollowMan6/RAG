The only thing to do is to add different values on what you want to be changed and apply the overlays.  \nWith **overlays** you can have several files ordered into folders. For example, if you need to modify some values inside a yaml file for a production environment, you can easily do it by using **overlays** without affecting your main files. You can also create another folder `nightly` for beta testing and put there different values.  \n\nTo apply an overlay, use this command:\n\n```sh\noc apply -k overlays/production\n```\n\nIt also possible to delete everything created by an overlay using this command:\n\n```sh\noc delete -k overlays/production\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PVC.YAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A YAML file that defines a PersistentVolumeClaim in Kubernetes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPLOYMENT.YAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A YAML file that specifies a deployment configuration in Kubernetes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE.YAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A YAML file that defines a service in Kubernetes to expose the application)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROUTE.YAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A YAML file that defines a route in OpenShift for external access to a service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGMAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Kubernetes object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVERLAYS/PRODUCTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A directory in Kustomize for storing overlay files that modify base configuration for a production environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command-line tool for controlling OpenShift clusters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTOMIZE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations with files)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PVC.YAML<|>OVERLAYS/PRODUCTION<|>The PVC.YAML file is modified in the overlays/production directory to change storage requests<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROUTE.YAML<|>OVERLAYS/PRODUCTION<|>The ROUTE.YAML file is modified in the overlays/production directory to change the host<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONFIGMAP<|>OVERLAYS/PRODUCTION<|>A ConfigMap is added in the overlays/production directory to provide new configurations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OC<|>OVERLAYS/PRODUCTION<|>The OC tool is used to apply or delete the configurations defined in overlays/production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUSTOMIZE<|>OVERLAYS/PRODUCTION<|>Kustomize is used to build the configurations defined in overlays/production<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
