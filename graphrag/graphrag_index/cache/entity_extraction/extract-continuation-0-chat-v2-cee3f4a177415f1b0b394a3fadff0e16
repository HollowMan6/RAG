We support currently Jupyter and RStudio based content, with more\noptions to come in the future. The intended workflow is that you create one workspace per course, and arrange your \nexercises in one or more applications in that workspace.\nInstead of a course you can also use Noppe for collaboration. The workflow is similar to creating a course environment and is described below.\n\n### 1. Become a workspace owner and create a workspace\n* Login to Noppe using your CSC account by choosing 'CSC Login' option after clicking 'Login'.\n  If you don't have a CSC account yet, [see the instructions on how to create new user account](../../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n* Open `Manage workspaces` from the left panel and create a new workspace.\n    * Workspace type:\n      * Fixed-time course with limited lifetime: Valid for limited months.\n      * Long-running course with time-limited membership: Can be extended 13 months at a time. Intended for workspaces that offer continuous learning environment.\n* If you don't see `Manage workspaces` option, please\n    * Check that you logged in using your CSC account. Your user account on the bottom of the left navigation\n      should look like 'csc/youraccountname'\n    * Reload your browser\n    * If the issue persists, contact Noppe support at servicedesk@csc.fi\n \n### 2. Find or create custom images\n\n* The easiest is to use an existing Docker image, look these repositories for suitable images:\n    * [Docker image sources in noppe-public-images repository.](https://github.com/CSCfi/noppe-public-images)\n    * [Rocker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker) for different RStudio set-ups.\n    * If you would need a few R/Python packages extra compared to existing images, it likely is easiest to add them run-time by the user.\n* To create your own custom image, see [Creating custom Docker images](#creating-custom-docker-images) below.\n\n### 3. Create an application in the workspace\n\nOpen `Manage workspaces` in the left navigation and select the workspace you want to work on. Create a new application \nthrough `Application wizard` or `Application form`-buttons.\n\n**Application template** Template provides the base features for your application. Most of the templates are based on\ncontainer images maintained by Noppe team. Take a look at the \n[image sources in noppe-public-images repository](https://github.com/CSCfi/noppe-public-images). \nIf you intend to use your own custom image, you can choose any template that matches your application type (Jupyter/RStudio).\n\n**Application name** Give a valid meaningful name. This is the name under which participants will see the application.\n\n**Application description** Fill a detailed description to helps users to understand more about the application.\n\n**Container image** \n* If using existing image, then pre-filled based on chosen Application template.\n* If using own custom image, then URL of the Docker image. \n\n**Session lifetime** The maximum lifetime for a single session. Sessions are deleted when they expire, thus making room \nfor other users.\n\n**Session memory** RAM memory reserved for each session. Workspaces have a limit for total memory for concurrent\nsessions. Choosing a higher value here will affect the maximum number of concurrent sessions.\n\n**Labels** Select the default labels or create custom labels. Labels are useful in searching applications. The icon for\nthe application is also selected based on assigned labels.\n\n**Download Method** The location to download the course contents from. Choose `git clone` if you wish to clone a git\nrepository. Choose `Download from url` if you have contents hosted in Allas or other HTTP accessible location and provide the url. Content is downloaded to $HOME folder of any instance by default.\n\n!!!Note\n\n    The external location needs to be publicly accessible. For example git repositories should be public.\n\nAs an alternative, the course material can be provided through `shared` folder. The workspace owner can prepare the\nshared folder in advance. The folder is visible for everyone, but is read-only for course participants.\n[See data persistence document for more information](data_persistence.md).\n\n**Work folder per user** Whether persistent user-based `my-work` folder is available for users in this application. \nThis is enabled by default.\n\n**Publication** Choose `save as draft` if you still need to test/change things in your application. Only after publication, which can be done here by choosing `publish immediately` or from the application menu (Manage workspaces > your workspace > your Application > 3 bars on right end of application > `publish`) later. Publication means that people with the join code can find the application. Your application will never appear for everyone. Only Noppe team can add self-learning and public-for-all applications.\n\n### 4. Invite users\n\nOnce the content is ready, you can invite course participants / collaborators by sharing a workspace specific join code. The code can be found in\n`Manage workspaces` view, in workspace list or on the Info tab of each workspace.\n\n### 5. Promote users\n\nOnce the co-instructors/co-organizers/collaborators have signed in, you can find their name in the `members` tab (under `manage workspaces`), to give them rights to change things and see other participants sessions, `promote to co-owner` from the Menu column next to the members name.\nCo-owners can do everything the owner can, except demoting the owner or deleting the workspace.
