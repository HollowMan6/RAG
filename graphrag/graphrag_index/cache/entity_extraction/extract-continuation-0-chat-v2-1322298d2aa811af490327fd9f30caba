Some examples of the accepted formats are listed below.\n\n!!! note\n    A dataset is usually defined as a set of files belonging to the same experiment and data type. One study can be linked to multiple datasets. Your study may include both sensitive (e.g. human genetic or phenotypic information) and non-sensitive data (e.g. viral sequences, metabolites). Only the sensitive data can be submitted to FEGA. The non-sensitive data can be published openly in appropriate repositories. In this case, the sample accessions generated at the repository should be referenced in the FEGA submission.\n    \n**Sensitive Data**:\n\n- **sequence data**: CRAM, BAM, FASTQ, VCF formats\n\n- **array data**: Data from all types of array-based technologies, such as genotypes, gene expression, methylations etc. is accepted. Central EGA also recommends submitting raw data (IDATs, CELs, final reports) and any analysis files.\n\n- **metagenomics**: EGA has adopted the suite of [Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS)](https://www.gensc.org/pages/projects/mixs-gsc-project.html) standards to describe data of this type.\n\n- **phenotypic information**: No specific format. Where possible, we recommend using the Experimental Factor Ontologies. To search for the correct ontology terms and to describe your phenotypic data, check the [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo) developed by EMBL-EBI.\n\n- **linking files**: If non-sensitive datasets belonging to the same study have been submitted to a specific repository, the samples can be linked to sensitive information submitted to FEGA for the same sample. The datasets should have different anonymised sample IDs in each archive. The IDs obtained in the appropriate archive can then be referenced in the FEGA submission. For example, the sample ID can be linked in an additional `.txt` file that can be added to one of the sensitive datasets above.\n\n**Non-sensitive data**:\n\nNon-sensitive data (or open data) needs to be submitted in appropriate archives. For example, sequences to the ENA [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), variants to EVA [European Variation Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/), array-based to [ArrayExpress â€“ functional genomics data](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), phenotypes to [BioSamples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/) and GWAS summary statistics to the [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).\n\n!!! note\n    For more information about data types and formats, check [Central EGA webpage](https://ega-archive.org/submission/sequence) or contact us at [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Federated EGA).\n\n## Step 5: Data encryption and upload \nNext, you can upload the data to Finnish FEGA. Each file uploaded to Finnish FEGA needs to be encrypted. \n\n!!! note\n    The data is encrypted with a FEGA public encryption key using crypt4gh, a tool designed to encrypt and share human genetic data according to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standard.\n    \nYou can carry out the encryption and upload steps using:\n\n- **Option 1 - Fi-FEGA upload application**. The Fi-FEGA upload application (graphical user interface, GUI) can be used to encrypt and upload files or folders automatically to Finnish FEGA.\n\nor\n\n- **Option 2 - Command-line interface**. Data encryption with crypt4gh CLI and data upload with sftp CLI. If you prefer to use the command-line interface, you can find information on the encryption and upload steps below. \n\n### Option 1 - Fi-FEGA upload application\n\n1. You can download the Fi-FEGA upload application specific to your operating system from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSCfi/sda-uploader/releases): Linux, Mac or Windows (release v0.7.0), select from the sdagui options. After downloading and unzipping the file, you can find the application in your download folder. When you open the application, you might encounter an error message. In this case, click on *More info* and verify that the publisher is CSC-IT Center for Science (or in Finnish: CSC-Tieteen tietotekniikan keskus Oy) and click on *Run anyway*. \n\n2. Next, download the [Finnish FEGA public encryption key](https://a3s.fi/fega-public-keys/fega-pubkey-c4gh.pub). \n\n3. Open the upload application and click on *Load recipient public key*. This opens a file browser that you can use to select the Finnish FEGA public encryption key (`fega-pubkey-c4gh.pub`). Next, click on *Open*.\n\n4. Click on *Select file to upload* or *Select directory to upload* to upload a single file or an entire folder. \n\n5. Next, you need to fill in the SFTP (or secure connection) credentials, which correspond to your Central EGA account username. In SFTP Username, write your EGA username (usually this is your email address). In SFTP Server, write the following: `admin.sd.csc.fi:50529`. Loading an SFTP key is not required for data uploads to FEGA.\n\n6.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform for the encryption and data upload of sensitive genetic and phenotypic information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Recommends formats for data submission and provides guidelines for sensitive and non-sensitive data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool designed for the encryption and sharing of human genetic data according to GA4GH standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC-IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Publisher of the Fi-FEGA upload application, also known as CSC-Tieteen tietotekniikan keskus Oy in Finnish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN NUCLEOTIDE ARCHIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Archive for submitting sequences as part of non-sensitive data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN VARIATION ARCHIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Archive for submitting variants as part of non-sensitive data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAYEXPRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Functional genomics data archive for submitting array-based data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOSAMPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Archive for submitting phenotypes as part of non-sensitive data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GWAS CATALOG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Archive for submitting GWAS summary statistics as part of non-sensitive data)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>Finnish FEGA follows the guidelines and recommendations provided by Central EGA for data submission<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>Crypt4GH is used for encrypting data before uploading to Finnish FEGA<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC-IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>CSC-IT Center for Science provides the Fi-FEGA upload application for data encryption and upload to Finnish FEGA<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN NUCLEOTIDE ARCHIVE<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>European Nucleotide Archive is recommended by Central EGA for submitting non-sensitive sequence data<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN VARIATION ARCHIVE<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>European Variation Archive is recommended by Central EGA for submitting non-sensitive variant data<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRAYEXPRESS<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>ArrayExpress is recommended by Central EGA for submitting non-sensitive array-based data<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOSAMPLES<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>BioSamples is recommended by Central EGA for submitting non-sensitive phenotypic data<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GWAS CATALOG<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>GWAS Catalog is recommended by Central EGA for submitting non-sensitive GWAS summary statistics<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
