In addition, NWChem has the capability to perform classical\nmolecular dynamics and free energy simulations. These approaches may be combined to\nperform mixed quantum-mechanics and molecular-mechanics simulations.\n\n## Available\n\n-   Puhti: 7.0.0\n-   Mahti: 7.0.0\n\n## License\n\n- The code is distributed as open-source under the terms of the\n[Educational Community License version 2.0 (ECL 2.0)](https://opensource.org/license/ecl-2-0/).\n\n## Usage\n\nCheck which versions are recommended:\n\n```bash\nmodule avail nwchem\n```\n\n### Batch script example for Puhti\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40 # MPI tasks per node\n#SBATCH --account=<project>  # insert here the project to be billed \n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00           # time as `hh:mm:ss`\n\nmodule load nwchem/7.0.0\nexport NWCHEM_RUN=$PWD/NWCHEM_RUN_$SLURM_JOB_ID\nmkdir -p $NWCHEM_RUN\nexport SCRATCH_DIR=$NWCHEM_RUN\nsrun $NWCHEM_EXE test.nw > test_$SLURM_NPROCS.out\nseff $SLURM_JOBID\n```\n\n!!! note\n    Particularly some of the more advanced electron correlation calculations can\n    be very disk I/O intensive.
