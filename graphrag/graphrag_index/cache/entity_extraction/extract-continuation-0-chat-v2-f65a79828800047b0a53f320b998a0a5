Since we install `python-openstackclient` with the root user, you must add `/usr/local/bin` in the PATH:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> vim ~/.bashrc\n    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n    ```\n\n1. Create a folder named `openstack` in `/etc`. Then, create a file named `clouds.yaml` in `/etc/openstack`. The YAML file must be like this:\n\n    ```yaml\n    clouds:\n      ha-example:\n        auth:\n          auth_url: https://pouta.csc.fi:5001/v3\n          project_name: project_xxxxxxx\n          username: <username>\n          password: <password>\n          user_domain_name: Default\n          project_domain_name: Default\n    <. . . additional options . . .>\n      region_name: regionOne\n      verify: False\n    ```\n\n1.

Create fencing for the HA cluster. First, you have to determine the UUID for each node in your cluster. You can run the command:\n   \n    ```sh\n    $> openstack server list\n    ```\n\n    Then:\n\n    ```\n    $> pcs stonith create <fence_name> fence_openstack pcmk_host_map=\"node1:node1_UUID;node2:node2_UUID;node3:node3_UUID\" power_timeout=\"240\" pcmk_reboot_timeout=\"480\" pcmk_reboot_retries=\"4\" cloud=\"ha-example\"\n    ```\n    Substitute `cloud=\"ha-example\"` with the name of the cloud you specified in the `clouds.yaml` file.\n\n1. You can view the available options with the following command:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs stonith describe fence_openstack\n    ```\n\n1. You can test fencing by running these commands:\n   \n    ```sh\n    $> pcs stonith fence node2\n    $> pcs status\n    $> pcs cluster start node2\n    ```\n\n!!! info \"Tip\"  \n    If you want to start (or restart) the fence, you can use this command:\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs stonith cleanup <fence_name>\n    ```\n    Useful if you apply a new `clouds.yaml` configuration for example.\n\n\n#### GFS2 setup\n!!! warning \"root user\"\n    The following commands are executed as the root user.  \n    It will be specified throughout this tutorial if the commands must be run on a single or every node.\n\n1.
