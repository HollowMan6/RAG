There is one *root directory* which you can refer to with the\n*forward slash symbol* (`/`). All the files and directories are located in the\nsubdirectories of this directory, so that each file has a unique\ncombination of a name and a directory path. Also, the commands that the user\ngives are executed in the directory that the user currently is in. It is\ncalled the *current working directory*.\n\nNormally, you do not need to know the explicit directory paths when you\nwork in the CSC environment. It is enough to know the locations of the\nfiles in the user's own disk areas. However, you should remember that many disk\nareas in the CSC environment can be accessed from several servers\n(e.g., the user's home directory) while some areas are server-specific. In\nthe case of shared disk areas, the path to a certain file may be\ndifferent on different servers.\n\n## Structure of Linux commands\n\nOnce a terminal connection to CSC, e.g., to Puhti, has been\nopened, the remote server is operated by using Linux commands. The standard\nstructure of a command is:\n\n```bash\ncommand -options argument1 argument2 ...\n```\n\nThe command is executed by pressing the *return key (Enter)*. The names\nand functions of the options and the arguments depend on the Linux command. In\nmany cases, you can run the command without any options or arguments.\nOptions are used to modify the actions that the command performs.\nArguments are used to define the files, directories and values that are\nused as input parameters and to define where the output is written.\n\nFor example, the command `ls` can be used as such or with several options\nand arguments. Running a plain command `ls` lists the contents of a\ndirectory in alphabetical order. You can modify the output of the\ncommand, for example, by using the option `-t`. With this option, the\ndirectory content list is ordered according to the age of the file (timestamp).\nIf no argument is given, `ls` prints the content of the current\nworking directory. By giving an argument to the `ls` command, the user can\ndefine a directory whose content should be listed. For example, the command\n\n```bash\nls -t /scratch/project_2979797\n```\n\nwill list the content of directory `/scratch/project_2979797`. In case there\nare errors in the command,\nthe arguments or the options, the command will not be executed\nwhen the return key is pressed. Instead, an error message is printed to\nthe screen. Thus, having errors in the command often does not cause\nany major problems. Issues may arise when using undefined shell variables. \nThe output of commands varies from one command to the other but in\nmany cases, no output means that command was successfully executed.\n\nMost of the Linux commands have their own manual page that can be\nstudied using the `man` command. For example, the manual page of `ls`\ncommand is shown using the command\n\n```bash\nman ls\n```\n\nManual pages can be very detailed and technical. However, often you\ndo not need to read and understand all the details given there,\nbut instead, you can just see what command-line options are available for\nthe particular command, which are of interest to you and then start\ntesting/using them in practice.\n\nThere are thousands of Linux commands, though, you do not need to know \nthe majority of them in order to get started. \nBelow, we introduce the most frequently used ones. You can also use \nthe command `apropos` to find a suitable command. \nApropos lists those Linux commands whose short description\nlines match the text that is given as a command argument. For example, \nif you want to look for commands that are processing *pdf* files, you \ncould type\n\n```bash\napropos pdf\n```\n\nNote that the listing that `apropos` prints includes only Linux\ncommands, not program names. Thus, the sample command\nabove would produce a list that contains many pdf conversion commands but\nno pdf viewers such as `acroread` or `evince`.\n\n## Basic commands for using directories\n\nThe table below lists the commands that are most frequently used for moving in\nthe directory hierarchy and managing it. Below are some examples of\ndirectory related commands.\n\n| Name    | Argument    | Description                                           |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| `cd`    | *directory* | Change current working directory                      |\n| `ls`    | *directory* | List the contents of a directory                      |\n| `pwd`   |             | Print the directory path of current working directory |\n| `mkdir` | *directory* | Create a new directory                                |\n| `rmdir` | *directory* | Remove a directory                                    |\n\nWhen you log in to a server at CSC, you will be taken to your home\ndirectory. You can check your location, i.e., the path of the current\nworking directory with the command `pwd` (abbreviation of Print\ncurrent Working Directory). However, you do not have to remember the\nlocation of your home directory (see the `cd` command).\n\nThe contents of the directory can be listed with the `ls` command.\nThe plain `ls` command just lists the names of the files and directories in\nyour current directory. You can get more information about the files and\ndirectories with command `ls -la`. The `-l` option produces a long\ndirectory listing that, in addition to the name, contains also information\nabout the access permissions, the size and the modification time of files and\ndirectories.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROOT DIRECTORY<|>GEO<|>The base directory in a Linux file system from which all other directories stem, represented by a forward slash '/')\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY<|>GEO<|>The directory in which the user is currently operating, changes based on user navigation commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Represents the computing environment where users can access disk areas from several servers, including user-specific and server-specific areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A server within the CSC environment that users can connect to and operate using Linux commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LS COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A Linux command used to list the contents of a directory, can be modified with options like '-t' to change the listing order)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCRATCH/PROJECT_2979797<|>GEO<|>An example of a directory path in the Linux file system where specific project files are stored)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAN COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A Linux command used to display the manual page of other commands, such as 'ls')\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APROPOS COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A Linux command used to search for commands related to a specific keyword, useful for finding commands that process certain file types like 'pdf')\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CD COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A Linux command for changing the current working directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PWD COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A Linux command that prints the path of the current working directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MKDIR COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A Linux command used to create a new directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RMDIR COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A Linux command used to remove a directory)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LS COMMAND<|>SCRATCH/PROJECT_2979797<|>The 'ls' command can be used to list the contents of the directory '/scratch/project_2979797'<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAN COMMAND<|>LS COMMAND<|>The 'man' command can be used to display the manual page for the 'ls' command<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APROPOS COMMAND<|>PDF<|>The 'apropos' command can be used to find commands related to processing 'pdf' files<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CD COMMAND<|>CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY<|>The 'cd' command changes the user's current working directory<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PWD COMMAND<|>CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY<|>The 'pwd' command prints the path of the current working directory<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MKDIR COMMAND<|>RMDIR COMMAND<|>The 'mkdir' and 'rmdir' commands are used to create and remove directories, respectively<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
