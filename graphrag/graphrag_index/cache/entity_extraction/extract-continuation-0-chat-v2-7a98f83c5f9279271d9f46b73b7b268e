Setting them up is\na simple two-step process.\n\n1. [Generate SSH keys on your local workstation](#generating-ssh-keys).\n    - SSH keys are always generated in pairs consisting of one _public key_ and\n    one _private key_. Generate these keys on the device you intend to use to\n    connect to CSC supercomputers.\n2. [Copy the public key from your workstation to a supercomputer](#copying-public-key-to-supercomputer).\n    - For authenticating an SSH connection using a key pair, you need to copy\n      the public key onto the supercomputer. **Do not copy the private key.**\n\n!!! warning\n    The private key should **never** be shared with anyone, not even with CSC\n    staff. It should only be stored on the local workstation.\n\n## Generating SSH keys\n\nTo find out how to generate SSH keys on your local workstation, see the\nsystem-specific instructions for:\n\n1. [Unix-based systems](ssh-unix.md) (macOS and Linux)\n2. [Windows systems](ssh-windows.md)\n\nYou can come back to these instructions once you are prompted for a file name\nand storage location for the keys. The following instructions assume you are in\nthe SSH key generation dialog.\n\nIf you have not set up SSH keys before, feel free to accept the default name\nand location by pressing `ENTER`. However, if using the default file name\nwould overwrite an existing key, you will receive a warning that looks like\nthis:\n\n```text\n/home/<username>/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists. Overwrite (y/n)?\n```\n\nGenerally, you do\nnot want to overwrite existing keys, so enter `n`, run `ssh-keygen` again\nand enter a different file name when prompted. See also the section on\n[SSH key files with non-default name or location](#ssh-key-file-with-non-default-name-or-location).\n\nNext, you will be asked for a passphrase. Please choose a secure\npassphrase. It should be at least 8 characters long and contain numbers,\nletters and special characters.\n\n!!! warning\n    Never leave the passphrase empty when generating an SSH key pair!\n\n### SSH key file with non-default name or location\n\nIf you want to store your key pair in a non-default location (somewhere else\nthan `~/.ssh/` or `C:\\Users\\<username>\\.ssh\\`), set the key location in the\n`.ssh/config` file or using an authentication agent (see system-specific\ninstructions). If you intend to use RStudio, Jupyter notebooks or something\nelse where the connecting from your local workstation to a compute node\nrequires piping through a login node, set agent-forwarding and the path to\nyour private key in the `.ssh/config` file as follows:\n\n```bash\nHost <host>.csc.fi\n  HostName <host>.csc.fi\n  User <username>\n  ForwardAgent yes\n  IdentityFile /<path-to-key-files>/<private-key>\n\nHost *.bullx\n  IdentityFile /<path-to-key-files>/<private-key>\n```\n\n## Copying public key to supercomputer\n\nThe recommended and easiest way to copy your public key to a CSC system is\n[through the My CSC customer portal](#adding-public-key-in-my-csc). For other\napproaches, please see the system-specific SSH instructions.\n\n### Adding public key in My CSC\n\nYou can add your public key through the\n[My CSC customer portal](https://my.csc.fi) by following these steps:\n\n1. Log in to My CSC with your CSC or Haka/Virtu credentials.\n2. Open the dropdown menu in the top right corner and select _My Profile_.\n3. Locate _SSH PUBLIC KEYS_ section and select _Add key_. As a security\n   measure, you are asked to log in again if it has been a few minutes since\n   you last logged into the portal.\n4. Enter a _Title_ for your key pair, e.g. \"my-ssh-key\".\n5. Paste your **public** SSH key into the _Key_ field. The supported key types\n   are RSA 2048, ECDSA 521 and ED25519 256.\n6. Select _Add_.\n7. You should now see your new key listed under _SSH PUBLIC KEYS_. Note that\n   it might take up to one hour for your new key to become active. If it takes\n   longer than that, please\n   [contact the CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).\n\n!!! info \"Required key format\"\n      Your public key should consist of the SSH key type and the key sequence,\n      separated by a single space. If your key is improperly formatted, an\n      error message is displayed. A key in the correct format looks like this:\n      ```\n      ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDlapOdeoxNvz/1AZFRjGAPnPj8pzzz3skI+a+yJS5b7\n      ```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SSH KEYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH keys are a method for authenticating to systems like CSC supercomputers, involving a public and private key pair for secure access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supercomputers provided by CSC for computational tasks, accessible via SSH keys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY CSC CUSTOMER PORTAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An online platform for CSC users to manage their profiles and SSH public keys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Support desk for CSC users to contact for help with services like SSH key setup)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH KEYS<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>SSH keys are used for secure authentication to CSC supercomputers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY CSC CUSTOMER PORTAL<|>SSH KEYS<|>The My CSC customer portal is used to add public SSH keys for CSC services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>MY CSC CUSTOMER PORTAL<|>The CSC Service Desk provides support for issues encountered on the My CSC customer portal<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
