The value of `<dist>` can be subdivided in multiple levels for\nthe distribution across for the nodes, sockets and cores. The first level of\ndistribution describes how the tasks are distributed between the nodes.\n\n=== \"block\"\n\n    The `block` distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that\n    consecutive tasks share a node.\n\n    ```\n     $ srun --nodes=2 \\\n            --ntasks-per-node=4 \\\n            --distribution=block bash -c ' \\\n              echo -n \"task $SLURM_PROCID (node $SLURM_NODEID): \"; \\\n              taskset -cp $$' | sort\n\n    task 0 (node 0): pid 115577's current affinity list: 0\n    task 1 (node 0): pid 115578's current affinity list: 1\n    task 2 (node 0): pid 115579's current affinity list: 2\n    task 3 (node 0): pid 115580's current affinity list: 3\n    task 4 (node 1): pid 98737's current affinity list: 0\n    task 5 (node 1): pid 98738's current affinity list: 1\n    task 6 (node 1): pid 98739's current affinity list: 2\n    task 7 (node 1): pid 98740's current affinity list: 3\n    ```\n\n\n=== \"cyclic\"\n\n    The `cyclic` distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that \n    consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive nodes (in a round-robin\n    fashion).\n\n    ```\n     $ srun --nodes=2 \\\n            --ntasks-per-node=4 \\\n            --distribution=cyclic bash -c ' \\\n              echo -n \"task $SLURM_PROCID (node $SLURM_NODEID): \"; \\\n              taskset -cp $$' | sort\n    \n    task 0 (node 0): pid 115320's current affinity list: 0\n    task 1 (node 1): pid 98006's current affinity list: 0\n    task 2 (node 0): pid 115321's current affinity list: 1\n    task 3 (node 1): pid 98007's current affinity list: 1\n    task 4 (node 0): pid 115322's current affinity list: 2\n    task 5 (node 1): pid 98008's current affinity list: 2\n    task 6 (node 0): pid 115323's current affinity list: 3\n    task 7 (node 1): pid 98009's current affinity list: 3\n    ```\n\nYou can specify the distribution across sockets within a node by adding a second\ndescriptor, with a colon (`:`) as a separator. In the example below, the numbers\nrepresent the **rank of the tasks**.\n\n=== \"block:block\"\n\n    The `block:block` distribution method will distribute tasks to the nodes \n    such that consecutive tasks share a node. On the node, consecutive tasks are\n    distributed on the same socket before using the next consecutive socket.\n\n    ```\n     $ srun --nodes=2 \\\n            --ntasks-per-node=4 \\\n            --distribution=block:block bash -c ' \\\n              echo -n \"task $SLURM_PROCID (node $SLURM_NODEID): \"; \\\n              taskset -cp $$' | sort\n    \n    task 0 (node 0): pid 111144's current affinity list: 0\n    task 1 (node 0): pid 111145's current affinity list: 1\n    task 2 (node 0): pid 111146's current affinity list: 2\n    task 3 (node 0): pid 111147's current affinity list: 3\n    task 4 (node 1): pid 93838's current affinity list: 0\n    task 5 (node 1): pid 93839's current affinity list: 1\n    task 6 (node 1): pid 93840's current affinity list: 2\n    task 7 (node 1): pid 93841's current affinity list: 3\n    ```\n\n=== \"block:cyclic\"\n\n    The `block:cyclic` distribution method will distribute tasks to the nodes \n    such that consecutive tasks share a node. On the node, tasks are\n    distributed in a round-robin fashion across sockets.\n\n    ```\n     $ srun --nodes=2 \\\n            --ntasks-per-node=4 \\\n            --distribution=block:cyclic bash -c ' \\\n              echo -n \"task $SLURM_PROCID (node $SLURM_NODEID): \"; \\\n              taskset -cp $$' | sort\n\n    task 0 (node 0): pid 110049's current affinity list: 0\n    task 1 (node 0): pid 110050's current affinity list: 64\n    task 2 (node 0): pid 110051's current affinity list: 1\n    task 3 (node 0): pid 110052's current affinity list: 65\n    task 4 (node 1): pid 92766's current affinity list: 0\n    task 5 (\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used for scheduling jobs on supercomputers, clusters, and computing grids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOCK DISTRIBUTION<|>EVENT<|>Block distribution method in SLURM distributes tasks to a node such that consecutive tasks share a node)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYCLIC DISTRIBUTION<|>EVENT<|>Cyclic distribution method in SLURM distributes tasks to a node such that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive nodes in a round-robin fashion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOCK:BLOCK DISTRIBUTION<|>EVENT<|>Block:block distribution method in SLURM distributes tasks to the nodes such that consecutive tasks share a node, and on the node, consecutive tasks are distributed on the same socket before using the next consecutive socket)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOCK:CYCLIC DISTRIBUTION<|>EVENT<|>Block:cyclic distribution method in SLURM distributes tasks to the nodes such that consecutive tasks share a node, and on the node, tasks are distributed in a round-robin fashion across sockets)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOCK DISTRIBUTION<|>SLURM<|>Block distribution is a method used by SLURM for task distribution among nodes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CYCLIC DISTRIBUTION<|>SLURM<|>Cyclic distribution is a method used by SLURM for task distribution among nodes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOCK:BLOCK DISTRIBUTION<|>SLURM<|>Block:block distribution is a method used by SLURM for task distribution among nodes and sockets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOCK:CYCLIC DISTRIBUTION<|>SLURM<|>Block:cyclic distribution is a method used by SLURM for task distribution among nodes and sockets<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
