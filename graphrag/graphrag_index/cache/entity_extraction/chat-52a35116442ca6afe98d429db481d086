If individual tasks are\nvery short you could use the option `--max_jobs` to decrease the splitting so that each array\njobÂ task would take at least around half an hour to process.\n\nAfter submitting an array job, `sbatch_commandlist` starts monitoring the progress of the\njob. If you use `sbatch_commandlist` interactively in the login nodes, you normally don't\nwant to keep the monitor running for hours. In these cases, you can just close the monitoring\nprocess by pressing `Ctrl-c`. The actual array job is not deleted, but it stays active in the\nbatch job system and you can manage it with normal Slurm commands.\n\nIn addition to interactive usage, `sbatch_commandlist` can be utilized in batch jobs and\nautomatic workflows, where only certain steps of the workflow can utilize array jobs based\nparallel computing. As an example, let's assume we have a gzip compressed tar-archive file\n`my_data.tgz` containing a directory with a large number of files. To create a new compressed\narchive, that includes also a md5 checksum file for each file we would need to:\n\n1. un-compress and un-pack `my_data.tgz`\n2. execute `md5sum` for each file and finally\n3. pack and compress the `my_data` directory again.\n\nThe second step of the workflow could be executed using a for-loop, but we could also use the\nloop just to generate a list of `md5sum` commands, that can be processed with `sbatch_commandlist` .\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=workfow\n#SBATCH --output=workflow_out_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=workflow_err_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=12:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem=4000\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\n#open the tgz file\ntar zxf my_data.tgz\ncd my_data\n\n#generate a list of md5sum commands\nfor my_file in *\ndo\n  echo \"md5sum $my_file > $my_file.md5\" >> md5commands.txt\ndone\n\n#execute the md5commands as an array job\nsbatch_commandlist -commands md5commands.txt\n\n#remove the command file and compress the directory\nrm -f md5commands.txt\ncd ..\ntar zcf my_data_with_md5.tgz my_data\nrm -rf my_data\n```\n\nNote that the batch job script above is not an array job, but it launches another batch job\nthat is an array job.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
