Interactive MATLAB\nPuhti has MATLAB installations for interactive use and batch jobs.\nThe interactive MATLAB is intended for temporary, light pre- and postprocessing of data.\nIt is available as follows:\n\n- License: Academic\n- Versions: from R2023a to R2024a\n- Toolboxes: Parallel Computing Toolbox.\n  There are 2 licenses for each toolbox.\n\n### Puhti - MATLAB Parallel Server\nMATLAB Parallel Server (MPS) allows sending work as a batch job from a local MATLAB installation to Puhti.\nIt is available as follows:\n\n- License: Academic\n- Versions: from R2021a to R2024a\n- Toolboxes: MATLAB Parallel Server.\n  There is license for using upto 500 computing cores simultaneously.\n  Furthermore, toolboxes that you have license on your local MATLAB license can also be used with MATLAB Parallel Server.\n\nThe academic license allows use only for the affiliates, that is staff and students, of Finnish higher education institutions.\nIf you are a user from a commercial company or Finnish research institute, please [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md) for further instructions.\n\n### LUMI - Interactive MATLAB\nLUMI has MATLAB an installation for interactive use.\n\n- License: Academic\n- Versions: from R2023b to R2024a\n- Toolboxes: Simulink, Control System Toolbox, Curve Fitting Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox, Global Optimization Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Wavelet Toolbox.\n  There are 25 licenses of each toolbox.\n\nThe academic license allows use only for teaching and academic research at a degree-granting institute.\n\n\n## Using interactive MATLAB on Puhti and LUMI\n### Command-line interface\nWe can run an interactive MATLAB session on the command line.\nWe first need to make a reservation using Slurm:\n\n```bash\nsrun --account=project_id --partition=small --time=0:15:00 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=4g --pty bash\n```\n\nPlease, replace the `project_id` with your project identifier, otherwise the script will fail.\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n\n    Then, we need to load the MATLAB module:\n\n    ```bash\n    module load matlab\n    ```\n\n=== \"LUMI\"\n\n    On LUMI, we must add the module files under CSC's local directory to the module path before loading the module.\n\n    ```bash\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n    module load matlab\n    ```\n\nNow `matlab`, `mbuild`, `mex` and `mcc` commands are available.\nFor example, we can open the MATLAB command line interface as follows:\n\n```bash\nmatlab -nodisplay\n```\n\nWe can also run MATLAB scripts using the batch mode as follows:\n\n```bash\nmatlab -batch <script>\n```\n\n\n### Web interface\nWe can also use the [web interface](../computing/webinterface/index.md) for interactive MATLAB sessions.\nFirst, we need to log into [www.puhti.csc.fi](https://www.puhti.csc.fi) or [www.lumi.csc.fi](https://www.lumi.csc.fi).\nThen, we have two options:\n\n1. We can use **MATLAB web application** which opens a web version of the MATLAB graphical user interface.\n\n2. We can use the **Desktop application** and click the MATLAB icon to open the desktop version of MATLAB graphical user interface.\n\n_On the LUMI Desktop Application, Matlab can be found via the menu button in the bottom left corner. Simply search for matlab and click the icon / drag it to the desktop to easily find it again._\n\nWe need to set atleast 4 GB of memory before launching the MATLAB application.\n\n\n## Parallel computing on MATLAB\nIn MATLAB, we can parallelize code using the high-level contructs from the [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/index.html).\nConsider the following serial code written in `funcSerial.m` file that pauses for one second `n` times and measures the execution time:\n\n```matlab\nfunction t = funcSerial(n)\nt0 = tic;\nfor idx = 1:n\n    pause(1);\nend\nt = toc(t0);\nend\n```\n\nThe following serial execution should run for around two seconds:\n\n```matlab\nfuncSerial(2)\n```\n\nWe can parallelize the function using the parallel for-loop construct, `parfor`, written into `funcParallel.m` file as follows:\n\n```matlab\nfunction t = funcParallel(n)\nt0 = tic;\nparfor idx = 1:n\n    pause(1);\nend\nt = toc(t0);\nend\n```\n\nTo run parallel code, we need to create a parallel pool using processes or threads and then run the parallel code.\nWe can create a parallel pool using two processes and run the parallel code with the same argument as serial but it should only take around one second:\n\n```matlab\npool = parpool('Processes', 2);\nfuncParallel(2)\ndelete(pool);\n```\n\nSame using parallel pool with threads:\n\n```matlab\npool = parpool('Threads', 2);\nfuncParallel(2)\ndelete(pool);\n```\n\nWith MATLAB Parallel Server we can also create parallel pools to Puhti and run parallel code there.\n\n<!-- TODO:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
