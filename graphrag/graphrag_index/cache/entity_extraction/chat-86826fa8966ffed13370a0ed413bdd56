If the size of an individual data file is hundreds of\ngigabytes or more, transporting only a few files may take longer than the\nduration of the token-based Allas authentication.\n\nIn this example, we use `a-put` to upload a set of large files from Mahti to\nAllas.\n\nThe first thing to do is to open a Mahti connection that can remain running for\na long time. In this example, we use `screen` command to open a session that\ncan be left running in the background:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@mahti.csc.fi\nscreen\n```\n\nThe `screen` command starts a virtual session on the login node of Mahti. You\ncan leave this virtual `screen` session running in the background and log out\nfrom Mahti, but you should check which login node (`mahti-login[11,12,14,15]`) \nyour session is running on because you need to log in to the same node to\nreconnect to your `screen` session later on.\n\nIn the `screen` session, first load the `allas` module and use `allas-conf` to\nestablish a connection to Allas.\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf -k\n```\n\nHere, `allas-conf` is used with the option `-k` that saves your CSC password in\nan environment variable (`$OS_PASSWORD`) so that the connection to Allas can\nlater be automatically reconfigured without needing to give the password again.\n\nAfter opening the Allas connection, we move to a directory `my_data` where we\nhave three subdirectories (`50`, `90`, `100`). We list the gzip-compressed\nfiles in these directories:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login11 ~] cd /scratch/project_2001659/my_data\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login my_data] ls -lh */*.gz\n-rw-rwxr-x 1 kkayttaj csc  45G May  8 12:57 100/uniref100.fasta.gz\n-rw-rwxr-x 1 kkayttaj csc  61G Jun  5 13:09 100/uniref100.xml.gz\n-rw-rwxr-x 1 kkayttaj csc 589M Jun  5 13:09 50/uniref50.fasta.gz\n-rw-rwxr-x 1 kkayttaj csc  17G Jun  5 13:09 50/uniref50.xml.gz\n-rw-r-xr-x 1 kkayttaj csc 4.2G Jul  6 09:46 90/uniref90.fasta.gz\n-rw-rwxr-x 1 kkayttaj csc  33G Jun  5 13:09 90/uniref90.xml.gz\n```\n\nNext, we launch the upload process. In this case, we do not use the default\nbucket name, but assign the name to be `2001659-uniref`:\n\n```bash\na-put -b 2001659-uniref */*.gz\n```\n\nThis command uploads the files listed above to Allas. Alternatively, we could\nlaunch the same upload with `rclone copy`:\n\n```bash\nfor f in */*.gz\ndo\n    rclone copy $f allas:2001659-uniref\ndone\n```\n \nWe can leave the session running in the background by pressing `Ctrl-A D`. Now,\nwe can log out from Mahti with the `screen` session remaining active in the\nMahti login node we used (in this case, `mahti-login11`).\n\nTo re-connect to this session, we first connect to the Mahti node where the\n`screen` session is running:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@mahti-login11.csc.fi\n```\n\nThen, we reattach the `screen` session:\n\n```bash\nscreen -r\n``` \n\nOnce the `a-put` command is finished, we will run `a-check` command to check if\nall the data objects have been created. `a-check` needs to be executed with the\nexact same options that were used with the `a-put` command. So in this case the\ncommand would be:\n\n```bash\na-check -b 2001659-uniref */*.gz\n```\n\nThe `a-check` command compares the item names to be uploaded to the matching\nobjects in Allas. The files or directories that don't have a target object in\nAllas are reported and stored in a file. In this case, if some objects in the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
