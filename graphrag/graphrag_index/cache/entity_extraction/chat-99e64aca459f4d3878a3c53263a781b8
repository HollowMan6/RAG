This mode\n    reserve 1 core to the operating system. In order to get a more balanced \n    layout, we also disabled the first core in each of the 8 L3 region. As a\n    consequence only 56 cores are available to the jobs. Jobs requesting 64 \n    cores/node will never run.\n\nThis page covers advanced topics related to running Slurm batch jobs on LUMI.\nIf you are not already familiar with Slurm, you should read the [Slurm\nquickstart][slurm-quickstart] guide which covers the basics. You can also refer\nto the Slurm [documentation][slurm-doc] or [manual pages][slurm-man], in\nparticular the page about [sbatch][slurm-sbatch].\n\nFor example job scripts, please see the following pages:\n\n- [GPU job examples scripts][lumig-examples]\n- [CPU job examples job scripts][lumic-examples]\n\n## Specifying the account\n\nThe account option (`--account=project_<id>`) is mandatory. Failing to set\nit will cause the following error:\n\n```text\nUnable to allocate resources: Job violates accounting/QOS policy \n(job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)\n```\n\nIf you don't want to specify the account to use every time you submit a job, you\ncan add the following lines to your `.bashrc` file.\n\n```bash\nexport SBATCH_ACCOUNT=project_<id>\nexport SALLOC_ACCOUNT=project_<id>\n```\n\nwhere you have to replace `project_<id>` with the ID of the project you have\nbeen granted.\n\n## Automatic requeuing\n\nThe LUMI Slurm configuration has **automatic requeuing** of jobs upon node\nfailure **enabled**. It means that if a node fails, your job will be\nautomatically resubmitted to the queue and will have the same job ID and\npossibly truncate the previous output. Here are some important parameters you\ncan use to alter the default behavior.\n\n- you can disable automatic requeuing using the `--no-requeue` option\n- you can avoid your output file being truncated in case of requeuing by using\n  the `--open-mode=append` option\n\nYou can apply these two options permanently by exporting the following\nenvironment variables in your `.bashrc`:\n\n- `SBATCH_NO_REQUEUE=1` to disable requeuing\n- `SBATCH_OPEN_MODE=append` to avoid output truncating after requeuing\n\nIf you want to perform specific operations in your batch script when a job has\nbeen requeued, you can check the value of the `SLURM_RESTART_COUNT` variable.\nThe value of this variable will be `0` if it is the first time the job is run.\nIf the job has been restarted, the value will be the number of times the\njob has been restarted.\n\n## Common error messages\n\nBelow are some common error messages you may get when your job submission\nfails.\n\n### Invalid account or account/partition combination specified\n\nThe complete error message is:\n\n```text\nsbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified\n```\n\nThis error message relates to improper use of the Slurm options\n`--account=<project>` and `--partition`. The most common causes are:\n\n- the project does not exist.\n- the project exists, but you are not a member of it.\n- the partition does not exist.\n\n### Job violates accounting/QOS policy\n\nThe complete error message is:\n\n```text\nsbatch: error: AssocMaxSubmitJobLimit\nsbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)\n```\n\nThe most common causes are:\n\n- your project has already used all of its allocated compute resources.\n- job script is missing the `--account` parameter.\n- your project has exceeded the limit for the number of simultaneous jobs, either\n  running or queuing. Note that Slurm counts each job within an array job as a\n  separate job.\n\n## Common Slurm options\n\nHere is an overview of some of the most commonly used Slurm options.\n\n### Basic job specification\n\n| Option        | Description                                              |\n| --------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `--time`      | Set a limit on the total run time of the job allocation  |\n| `--account`   | Charge resources used by this job to specified project   |\n| `--partition` | Request a specific partition for the resource allocation |\n| `--job-name`  | Specify a name for the job allocation                    |\n\n### Specify tasks distribution\n\n| Option                | Description                                 |\n| ----------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| `--nodes`             | Number of nodes to be allocated to the job  |\n| `--ntasks`            | Set the maximum number of tasks (MPI ranks) |\n| `--ntasks-per-node`   | Set the number of tasks per node            |\n| `--ntasks-per-socket` | Set the number of tasks on each node        |\n| `--\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
