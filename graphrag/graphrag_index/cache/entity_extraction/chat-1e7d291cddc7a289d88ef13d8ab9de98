Stacks was developed to work with restriction enzyme-based data, such as RAD-seq, for \nthe purpose of building genetic maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2.62, 2.65\n\n## Usage\n\nThe command-line tools of the Stacks package are installed on Puhti. To set up the most recent stacks environment on Puhti, \nrun the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nAfter that you can launch Stacks commands like `denovo_map.pl`. For example:\n\n```bash\ndenovo_map.pl -m 3 -M 2 -n 3 -T 4 -S -b 1 -t -a 2010-11-30 -o ./stacks -p ./samples/male.fa -p ./samples/female.fa -r ./samples/progeny_1.fa -r ./samples/progeny_2.fa -r ./samples/progeny_3.fa\n```\n\nAs stacks jobs can be rather heavy, they should be executed as batch jobs. The Stacks installation on Puhti is not linked to \na stacks result database and web interface. Because of that you should use option `-S` (and not options `-B` and `-D`) in \n`denovo_map.pl` runs.\n\nIt is, however, possible to set up your own Stacks database and WWW interface to a virtual machine running in the \ncPouta cloud environment of CSC.
