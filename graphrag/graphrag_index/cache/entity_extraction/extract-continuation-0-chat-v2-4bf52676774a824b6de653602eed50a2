If you wish to run a container-based application, first check the [application pages](../../apps/index.md) to see if a pre-installed container is already available. Also see our [documentation on how to run containers](run-existing.md).\n\nIf you cannot find a pre-built container, one option is to build your own. If a Docker container image already exists, you can often simply convert that to an Apptainer container. Another option is to build your own container from scratch.  Both approaches will be discussed below. As always, if you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to contact [CSC's Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).\n\n## Converting a Docker container\n\nIf you already have an existing Docker container, in many cases it can easily be converted to an Apptainer image. Docker container images can be found in public repositories such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), but **please take care to only use images uploaded from reputable sources** as these images can easily be a source of security vulnerabilities or even contain malicious code.\n\nGPU-optimized containers can also be found in [NVIDIA's GPU cloud (NGC)](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/). These containers have been prepared by NVIDIA, and should thus be safe.\n\nFurther [information about converting Docker containers can be found in the Apptainer documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/docker_and_oci.html).\n\nHere is an example of how to build an Apptainer image on Puhti from [NVIDIA's PyTorch Docker image](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch). We'll use `sinteractive` as heavy processing should not be done in the login nodes.\n\n```bash\n# Let's start a 1 hour interactive job with enough memory and local scratch space\nsinteractive --account <project> --time 1:00:00 -m 16G --tmp 64\n\n# Let's use the fast local drive for temporary storage\nexport APPTAINER_TMPDIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH\nexport APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH\n\n# This is just to avoid some annoying warnings\nunset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\n\n# Change directory to where you wish to store the image\ncd /projappl/<project>\n\n# Do the actual conversion\n# NOTE: the Docker image is downloaded straight from NGC\napptainer build pytorch_22.09-py3.sif docker://nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.09-py3\n```\n\nNote that the Apptainer image `.sif` files can easily be several GB in size, so they should not be stored in your home directory, but for example in the project application directory [projappl](/computing/disk).\n\nAlso see our [documentation on how to run containers](run-existing.md).\n\n## Build a container from scratch\n\nYou can also build your own container from scratch. This is an option for more experienced users, and your main source of information is the [official Apptainer documentation on building containers](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/build_a_container.html).\n\nYou can find some help also by looking at our [tutorial on building Apptainer containers from scratch](../../support/tutorials/singularity-scratch.md).\n\n## Building a container without sudo access on Puhti and Mahti\n\nRoot access into Puhti and Mahti is not permitted. Namespaces have also been disabled due to security issues involved. However, with a few restrictions, Apptainer can still be used by an unprivileged user to build a container using the [fakeroot](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/fakeroot.html) feature.\n\nApptainer enables `--fakeroot` flag by default when building containers if `sudo` or namespaces are not available, this makes the user appear as `root:root` while building the container, thus enabling them to build images that require root file permissions e.g. to install packages via `apt`.\nHowever, this only makes the user *appear* as the root user, in the host system a user still has no additional permissions. By itself, fakeroot is not always sufficient, and building some containers may fail due to various reasons. For more details see the [official Apptainer documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/fakeroot.html).\n\nThe following simple example definition file (saved as `ubuntu.def`) creates an image based on Ubuntu 22.04 with one package installed.\n\n```text title=\"ubuntu.def\"\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:22.04\n%post\n\tapt-get update\n\tapt-get install -y cowsay\n```\n\nThe image can be built with `apptainer build ubuntu.sif ubuntu.def` and ran as `apptainer shell ubuntu.sif`. Now, the installed package can be accessed in the shell opened by typing `echo hello | /usr/games/cowsay`. Note that `sudo` is not required to run these commands.\n\nBelow is a table of common docker base images and whether installing simple packages with the distribution's default package manager works on them in Puhti and Mahti:\n\n|Image|Tag|Works|\n|-----|---|-----|\n|alpine|3.6-3.19|no|\n|almalinux|8-9|yes|\n|debian|buster-trixie|yes|\n|centos|7|yes|\n|opensuse/leap|15.0,15.6|no|\n|opensuse/leap|15.1-15.5|yes|\n|redhat/ubi|8-\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides supercomputing resources such as Puhti and Mahti and supports running Apptainer containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of CSC's supercomputers that supports running Apptainer containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is one of CSC's supercomputers that supports running Apptainer containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer, formerly known as Singularity, is a container solution supported by CSC for running container-based applications on supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers, which can be converted to Apptainer images for use on CSC's supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER HUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker Hub is a public repository for Docker container images, from where users can download images to convert to Apptainer containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NVIDIA provides GPU-optimized containers through its GPU cloud (NGC), which can be converted to Apptainer images for use on CSC's supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA'S GPU CLOUD (NGC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NVIDIA's GPU Cloud (NGC) is a platform offering GPU-optimized container images prepared by NVIDIA for various computing needs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti is one of the supercomputers provided by CSC for scientific computing and supports running Apptainer containers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MAHTI<|>Mahti is one of the supercomputers provided by CSC for scientific computing and supports running Apptainer containers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>APPTAINER<|>CSC supports running Apptainer containers on its supercomputers like Puhti and Mahti<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER<|>APPTAINER<|>Docker containers can be converted to Apptainer images for use on CSC's supercomputers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER HUB<|>DOCKER<|>Docker Hub is a source of Docker container images that can be converted to Apptainer images<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA<|>NVIDIA'S GPU CLOUD (NGC)<|>NVIDIA's GPU Cloud (NGC) provides GPU-optimized containers that can be converted to Apptainer images<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
