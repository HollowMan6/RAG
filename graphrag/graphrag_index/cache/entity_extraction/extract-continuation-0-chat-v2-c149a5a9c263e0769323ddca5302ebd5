Containers and Apptainer\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 6\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/singularity/singularity_extra_creating-containers.html\n---\n\n# Creating Apptainer containers\n\n💬 In this tutorial we will create an Apptainer container and install the same\nsoftware as we installed in the tutorial\n[\"Installing a simple C code from source\"](../installing/mcl.md). Feel free to\nrevisit that tutorial for more information on the installation commands.\n\n💬 CSC supercomputers support the `fakeroot` feature of Apptainer, so it is\npossible to build container images without root privileges. There are some\nlimitations, so it is possible to run into problems, especially when using\npackage managers. In these cases it is necessary to either use an alternative\ninstallation method for the dependency, or build on a system where you do have\nroot privileges.\n\n☝🏻 We will only cover Apptainer basics here. Detailed instructions can be\nfound in the official\n[Apptainer documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html).\n\n## Sandbox mode\n\n💬 One way to create an Apptainer container is in the so-called sandbox mode.\nInstead of an image file, we create a directory structure representing the file\nsystem of the container.\n\n💬 First, we'll create a basic container from a definition file. In order to\nchoose a suitable Linux distribution, you should check the documentation of the\nsoftware you wish to install. If the developers provide installation\ninstructions for a specific distribution, it is usually easiest to start with\nthat.\n\n💭 In this case there is no specific reason to choose one distribution over\nanother, but from experience it is known that the software installs without\nproblems on CentOS, so we'll start with that.\n\n1. Start from a very bare-bones definition file. Copy the following lines to a\n   file called `centos.def`:\n\n   ```text\n   Bootstrap: yum\n   OSVersion: 7\n   MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/\n   Include: yum\n   ```\n\n2. By default, Apptainer uses the home directory for cached files. As the home\n   directory is quite small and easily fills up, it is recommended to use some\n   other directory. For example to use `$TMPDIR` (make sure it is defined) set:\n\n   ```bash\n   export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=$TMPDIR\n   ```\n\n3. You can clean the cache with command:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer cache clean\n   ```\n\n4. Using this definition file, build the container:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer build --fakeroot --sandbox mcl centos.def\n   ```\n\n5. Note that instead of an image file, we created a directory called `mcl`. If\n   you need to include some reference files etc., you can copy them to the\n   correct subdirectory.\n6. We can now open a shell in the container. We need the container file system\n   to be writable, so we include the option `--writable`. We will also need to\n   include `--fakeroot` option:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer shell --fakeroot --writable mcl\n   ```\n\n7. The command prompt should now be `Apptainer>`.\n\n   💡 The base container images are typically very bare-bones and do not\n   contain any compilers, download tools etc., so those need to be installed.\n   If there is a need to make the container as small as possible, we should\n   only install the dependencies we need. Usually the size is not that\n   critical, so we may opt for ease of use.\n   \n   💡 In this case we will install the application group \"Development Tools\"\n   that includes most of the components we need (C, C++, make), but also a lot\n   of tools not needed in this example. We also install `wget` to download the\n   source code.\n\n   💡 Notice that unlike on CSC supercomputers, we are able to use package\n   management tools (in this case `yum`). This will often make installing\n   libraries and other dependencies easier. Also notice that it is not\n   necessary to use `sudo` inside the container:\n\n   ```bash\n   yum group install \"Development Tools\" -y\n   yum install wget -y\n   ```\n\n8. We are now ready to install the `mcl` software. Download and extract the\n   distribution package:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://micans.org/mcl/src/mcl-latest.tar.gz\n   tar xf mcl-latest.tar.gz\n   cd mcl-14-137\n   ```\n\n9. Run configure:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure\n   ```\n\n10. Check the output of `configure` and install any missing dependencies. In\n    this case there should not be any. Finally, run `make`:\n\n    ```bash\n    make\n    make install\n    ```\n\n11. We can now test the application to see if it works:\n\n    ```bash\n    mcl --version\n    ```\n\n12. If everything works we can clean up:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ..\n    rm -rf mcl-*\n    ```\n\n13. We can also add a `runscript`:\n\n    ```bash\n    echo 'exec /bin/bash \"$@\"' >> /apptainer\n    ```\n\n14. We can now exit the container\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer is a container platform that allows for the creation and management of containers without root privileges, supporting features like sandbox mode and fakeroot)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC supercomputers support the `fakeroot` feature of Apptainer, enabling building of container images without root privileges)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS<|>GEO<|>CentOS is a Linux distribution known for compatibility with software installations, chosen for the Apptainer container in this tutorial)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MCL is software installed in the Apptainer container, demonstrating the process of containerized software installation)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>CSC<|>CSC supercomputers support the Apptainer feature of building container images without root privileges<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>CENTOS<|>Apptainer container in this tutorial is based on the CentOS Linux distribution<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>MCL<|>MCL software is installed within an Apptainer container as part of the tutorial<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
