AMD compilers can be\nloaded using the [Modules](modules.md) system with the command:\n```\nmodule load aocc\n```\n\nDifferent applications function better with different suites, so the selection\nneeds to be done on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe MPI environment in Mahti is OpenMPI, and when building MPI\napplications all compiler suites can be used with\nthe `mpicc` (C), `mpicxx` (C++), or `mpif90` (Fortran) wrappers.\n\nThe compiler options for different suites are different.
