Material properties,\nsource terms and boundary conditions can all be arbitrary functions of\nthe dependent variables.\n\n## Available\n \n- Puhti: 6.2, 6.1, 6.0\n\n## License\nThe terms of use of this software allow it to be used only by affiliates (staff\nand students) of Finnish higher education institutions.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following modules are currently available:\n\n-   Acoustics\n-   AC/DC\n-   CAD Import\n-   CFD\n-   Heat Transfer\n-   Particle Tracing\n-   Structural Mechanics\n\nThe preferred method to use COMSOL interactively is via [the Puhti web interface\ndesktop application](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). In the web interface,\nselect `Desktop` from the `Apps` view and specify the required resources (cores,\nexecution time and memory). Remember to add your billing project, too.\n\nWait for a while as your interactive job sits in the queue and after that you can start\nCOMSOL with double-clinking its icon (tick the box if you want to receive an email when your session starts).\n\n!!! Note\n    You can now also enable [interactive visualization with GPU\n    acceleration](../computing/webinterface/accelerated-visualization.md) for better\n    performance. In this case, select `Accelerated visualization` instead of `Desktop`\n    in the Puhti web interface.\n\nSometimes, you may encounter errors relating to OpenGL rendering during\nthe launch. The solution is to force COMSOL to start with software\nrendering from Desktop app `Terminal` using\n\n```bash\nmodule load comsol\ncomsol -3drend sw\n```\n\n\n## More information\n\n- [COMSOL Multiphysics home page](https://www.comsol.com)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
