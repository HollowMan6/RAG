You need to have a line per VM node that you want to include in the cluster. Finally, if you are using a Jump Host, you need to replace `<jumphost>` by its connection information, like `ubuntu@177.51.170.99`\n\n1. Create a playbook (`main-ocfs2.yml` in this example) like this one:\n\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n\n    - name: Configure VMs\n      hosts: all\n      gather_facts: true\n      become: true\n      roles:\n        - role: hosts\n        - role: ocfs2\n    ```\n\n    This will run two roles, the hosts one if to create a `/etc/hosts` file in every VM with the IPs and names of every VM. The `ocfs2` role installs and configures the cluster.\n\n1. And run it:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ ansible-playbook main-ocfs2.yml -i inventory.ini\n\n    ```\n\n### OCFS2 manual install\n\nIn order to install OCFS2, you need to follow few steps:\n\n1. Install the VM nodes. There is no special consideration on this step, other than making sure the nodes can see each other in the Network (it is the default behaviour of VM nodes created in the same Pouta project), and that they are installed with the same distribution version. We have tested this with `Ubuntu v22.04` and `AlmaLinux-9`, other distributions and versions might also work, but we have not tested them. This guide will use **Ubuntu** as an example.  \nAlmaLinux requires to install an specific [Oracle kernel](https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Oracle%20Linux%20and%20Virtualization/1253272_1.html). More information in the [FAQ](#ocfs2-faq)\n\n1. Create and attach the volume. See the manual [Create and attach a volume](#create-and-attach-a-volume) from above.\n\n1. Install the OCFS2 software:\n\n    ```sh\n    ocfs2-tools linux-modules-extra-<kernel_version> linux-image-$(uname -r)\n    ```\n    We have tested this with `<kernel_version>` == `6.5.0-21-generic`, but newer versions should work as well or better.\n\n1. Make sure that every node domain name can be resolved in every other node. In Pouta, the simplest way is to use [/etc/hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), where each host has a line similar to:\n\n    ```sh\n    <ip> <vm_name>\n    ```\n\n1. Enable ocfs2 in every node using:\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo dpkg-reconfigure ocfs2-tools\n    ```\n\n1. Create the file system. You need to do this in **only one** of the VM nodes.\n\n    ```sh\n    mkfs.ocfs2 -N <number_instances> /dev/vdb\n    ```\n\n    Replace `<number_instances>` by the number of VM nodes in the cluster. Pay also attention and double check that `/dev/vdb` is the proper volume name. In principle `vdb` is going to be the first attached volume to a VM, but this might not be true in all cases.\n\n1. Generate the file `/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf`. A minimal working example would follow this template:\n\n    ```\n    {% for host in groups['all'] %}\n    node:\n      ip_port = 7777\n      ip_address = {{ hostvars[host]['ansible_host'] }}\n      number = {{ groups['all'].index(host)+1 }}\n      name = {{ host }}\n      cluster = ocfs2\n    {% endfor %}\n    cluster:\n      node_count = {{ number_instances }}\n      name = ocfs2\n    ```\n\n1. Reboot so the kernel you installed is taken into use. Make sure that the `ocfs2` service is up and running (`systemctl status ocfs2`).\n\n1. Finally mount the volume in each node:\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo mount /dev/vdb /mnt\n    ```\n    As the device may change in any moment, it is recommended to use the `UUID` for any serious deployment. You can get the `UUID` by using the command `blkid`:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ sudo blkid /dev/vdb\n    /dev/vdb: UUID=\"785134b8-4782-4a1f-8f2a-40bbe7b7b5d2\" BLOCK_SIZE=\"4096\" TYPE=\"ocfs2\"\n    ```\n    In this case the command will be `sudo mount -U 785134b8-4782-4a1f-8f2a-40bbe7b7b5d2 /mnt`\n\n\n### OCFS2 FAQ\n\n- **How to add more nodes?**\n\n    It is possible to add more nodes to a ocfs2 cluster, but it requires a downtime.\n\n    First you need to increase the number of slots, using `tunefs.ocfs2`. Before that, you need to umount the volume in every VM node. These are the two commands you need to run. The second one only needs to be executed in a single node:\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo umount /mnt\n    sudo tunefs.ocfs2 -N 25 /dev/vdb\n    ```\n\n    Secondly, create the new\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OCFS2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OCFS2 is a cluster file system that allows for the sharing of files among nodes in a cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU<|>GEO<|>Ubuntu is a distribution version used for installing VM nodes in the OCFS2 setup guide)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMALINUX-9<|>GEO<|>AlmaLinux-9 is another distribution version mentioned in the OCFS2 setup guide for installing VM nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORACLE KERNEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oracle kernel is required for AlmaLinux installations as per the OCFS2 manual install guide)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALMALINUX-9<|>ORACLE KERNEL<|>AlmaLinux requires the installation of an Oracle kernel for OCFS2 setup<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UBUNTU<|>OCFS2<|>Ubuntu is used as an example distribution for setting up OCFS2 in the guide<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
