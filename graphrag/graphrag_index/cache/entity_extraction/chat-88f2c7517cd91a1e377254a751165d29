[See here for information about the disk areas on LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/)\n- Moving data between supercomputers\n- Understanding quotas (available space and number of files) of different disk areas\n- Additional fast disk areas\n\n# Disk and storage overview  \n\n![](./img/disk-systems.svg){width=90%}\n\n# Main disk areas in Puhti/Mahti\n\n- Home directory (`$HOME`)\n    - Other users cannot access your home directory\n- ProjAppl directory (`/projappl/project_name`)\n    - Shared with project members\n    - Possible to limit access (`chmod g-rw`) to subfolders\n- Scratch directory (`/scratch/project_name`)\n    - Shared with project members\n    - Files older than 180 days will be automatically removed\n- These directories reside on the [Lustre parallel file system](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/lustre/)\n- Default quotas and more info in [disk areas section of Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/)\n\n# Moving data between and to/from supercomputers\n\n- Puhti and Mahti have separate file systems\n- Data can be moved between the supercomputers\n    - [directly with rsync](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/rsync/)\n    - via [Allas object storage](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/)\n- There are [many ways to transfer data between the CSC supercomputers and your local computer](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/)\n\n# Displaying current status of disk areas\n\n- Use the `csc-workspaces` command to show available projects and quotas\n\n![](./img/disk_status.png){width=50%}\n\n# Disk and storage overview (revisited) \n\n![](./img/disk-systems.svg){width=90%}\n\n# Additional fast local disk areas \n\n- [`$TMPDIR` on login nodes](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/#login-nodes)\n    - Each of the login nodes have 2900 GiB of fast local storage in `$TMPDIR`\n    - The local disk is meant for temporary storage (_e.g._ compiling software) and is cleaned frequently\n- [NVMe disks on some compute nodes on Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/#local-storage)\n    - Interactive, I/O and GPU nodes have fast local disks (NVMe) in `$LOCAL_SCRATCH`\n    - Also, the [GPU nodes on Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-mahti/#gpu-batch-jobs) have fast local storage available\n    - You must copy data to and from the fast disk during your batch job since the NVMe is accessible only during your job allocation\n    - If your job reads and/or writes a lot of small files, using this can give a huge performance boost!\n\n# What are the different disk areas for?\n\n- [Allas](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/) -- for data which is not actively used\n- [`$HOME`](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/#home-directory) -- small, only for the most important (small) files, personal access only\n- [`/scratch`](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/#scratch-directory) -- main working area, shared with project members, only for data in active use\n- [`/projappl`](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/#projappl-directory) -- not cleaned up, _e.g._ for shared binaries\n- [Login node `$TMPDIR`](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/#login-nodes) -- compiling, temporary storage, fast I/O\n- [Compute node NVMe `$LOCAL_SCRATCH`](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/#local-storage) -- fast I/O in batch jobs\n\n# Best practices\n\n- None of the disk areas are automatically backed up by CSC, so make sure to perform regular backups to, _e.g._, Allas\n- Don't run databases or Conda on Lustre (`/projappl`, `/scratch`, `$HOME`)\n    - Containerize Conda environments with [Tykky](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/) and use other CSC services like [Kaivos](https://docs.csc.fi/data/kaivos/overview/) or [cPouta](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/) for databases (Rahti also an option but connecting to it from Puhti/Mahti is complicated)\n- Don't create a lot of files, especially within a single folder\n    -
