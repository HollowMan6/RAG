LUMI projects are restricted to LUMI environment only (LUMI-C, LUMI-G etc.). Finnish LUMI projects are fixed in time and resources, and the total resources must be defined already in the project application.\n\nA Finnish LUMI project can include one or several CSC user accounts and one CSC user account can be a member in several Finnish LUMI projects. Each LUMI project must have a Principal Investigator (i.e. Project Manager), who creates the project and applies for resources, manages the user accounts that belong to the project and is responsible of the resource usage. The LUMI Project Manager is typically a leader of a research team or other senior researcher. See more for [project manager prerequisites](https://research.csc.fi/en/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager).\n\nLUMI services are free of charge for academic research for members of Finnish higher education institutions and state research institutes.\n\n### Creating a LUMI project and applying for resources\n\n6. Select **LUMI** from the Project category list.\n7. Select LUMI **Access mode** (Regular, Benchmark, or Development)\n8. Fill in the **resources**: CPU core hours, GPU hours, Storage hours, and all the **text fields** carefully below. If the data is incomplete or insufficient, the application will be rejected. For Regular Access applications, a list of prior publications and a proper research plan are required. For Benchmark Access, a plan of how the resources will be used for the benchmarks is required, and for Development Access a description of program codes, methods and development objectives is required.\n9. Select the **Field of Science**, and fill in the **Keywords**.\n10. Does your project handle personal data? Please note: **LUMI projects are not allowed to handle personal data at present**.\n11. Tick the box I have read and accepted the LUMI General Terms of Use.\n12. Click **Create project**.\n\nOnce you have created the project, [invite the project members](how-to-add-members-to-project.md). Your LUMI project application will be sent to the CSC Resource allocation administration to be processed. The CSC Resource allocation group has meetings [every three weeks](https://research.csc.fi/applying-for-computing-resources).\n\nPlease note that LUMI access is provided only with SSH keys, not with passwords.
