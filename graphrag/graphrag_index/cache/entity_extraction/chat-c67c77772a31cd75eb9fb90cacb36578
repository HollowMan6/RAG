Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2.

Its main field of application is larger molecules, transition metal\ncomplexes, and their spectroscopic properties. ORCA is developed in the research group of\n[Frank Neese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Neese).
