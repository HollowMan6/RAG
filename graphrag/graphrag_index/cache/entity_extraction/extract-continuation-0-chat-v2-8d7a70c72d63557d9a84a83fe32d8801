Use this option for analyses that take longer or require a lot of memory.\n* [Interactive jobs on a compute node](../../computing/running/interactive-usage/), using either the R console or RStudio Server. Use this option for preparing your code and for smaller analyses. Interactive jobs may use limited resources.\n* Interactively on the login node, using the R console. Use this option only for moving data, checking package availability and installing packages. Puhti login nodes are [not intended for heavy computing](../../computing/usage-policy#login-nodes). \n\n#### Interactive use on a compute node\n\n***Starting a shell session on the interactive partition***\n\nTo use R interactively on Puhti compute nodes, open a shell session on the `interactive` partition using the `sinteractive` command. As an example, the command below would launch a session with 4 GB of memory and 10 GB of local scratch space. \n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project> --mem 4000 --tmp 10\n```\n\nIt is also possible to specify other options including the running time ([see the `sinteractive` documentation](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md)). \n\n***Launching the R console***\n\nOnce you have opened an interactive shell session, you can start a command line version of R as follows (note that the command needs to be run on a compute node):\n\n```bash\nmodule load r-env\nstart-r\n```\n\n***Using RStudio Server***\n\nThe`r-env` module can be used to remotely launch RStudio Server on your web browser. For this, you have two options.\n\n**Option 1. Using the Puhti web interface**. This is by far the easiest way to launch RStudio on Puhti. For details, [see the Puhti web interface documentation](../computing/webinterface/index.md).\n\n**Option 2. Using SSH tunneling**. This option requires authentication using a Secure Shell (SSH) key. Detailed instructions for this are provided in a [separate tutorial for using RStudio Server](../support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks.md) and our [documentation on setting up SSH keys on Windows, macOS and Linux](../computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md).\n\n#### Interactive use on a login node\n\nTo launch the R console on a login node, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load r-env\napptainer_wrapper exec R --no-save\n\n# Note: this issues a warning mentioning that apptainer_wrapper\n# is meant for use on a compute node. However, R will still launch\n# as intended. \n```\n\n#### Non-interactive use\n\nFurther to interactive jobs, R scripts can be run non-interactively using batch job files. In addition to the following examples, [see this link](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md) for more information. Batch job files can be submitted to the batch job system as follows:\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file.sh\n```\n\n#### Serial batch jobs\n\nBelow is an example for submitting a single-processor R batch job on Puhti. Note that the `test` partition is used, which has a time limit of 15 minutes and is used for testing purposes only. For memory-intensive non-interactive jobs, we should also list a project-specific temporary directory in `/scratch/<project>`. We also execute the job using the `apptainer_wrapper` command.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_serial\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n\n# Load r-env\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save myscript.R\n```\n\nIn the above example, one task (`--ntasks=1`) is executed with 1 GB of memory (`--mem-per-cpu=1000`) and a run time of five minutes (`--time=00:05:00`) reserved for the job.\n\n#### Parallel batch jobs\n\nThe `r-env` module can be used for parallel computing in several ways. These include multi-core and array submissions, as well as MPI (Message Passing Interface)-based jobs. The module comes with several packages that support multi-node communication via MPI: `doMPI` (used with `foreach`), `future`, `lidR`, `pbdMPI` and `snow`.\n\nFurther to the following examples, please see our separate [tutorial for parallel R jobs](../support/tutorials/parallel-r.md). There is also [separate documentation on MPI jobs](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#mpi-based-batch-jobs). You may also wish to check the relevant R package manuals and [this page](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/puhti/02_parallel_future) for examples of parallel computing using\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>R-ENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module on Puhti for running R, including interactive and non-interactive jobs, with support for parallel computing)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing environment where the r-env module is used, offering various computing resources and services)##\n(\"entity\"<|>R CONSOLE<|>EVENT<|>A method to use R interactively on Puhti compute nodes and login nodes)##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSTUDIO SERVER<|>EVENT<|>A web-based interface for R provided by the r-env module on Puhti, accessible via Puhti web interface or SSH tunneling)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH TUNNELING<|>EVENT<|>A method for securely launching RStudio Server on Puhti, requiring SSH key authentication)##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER_WRAPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command used on Puhti to execute jobs in a containerized environment, including running R scripts)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R-ENV<|>PUHTI<|>The r-env module is specifically designed for use within the Puhti computing environment<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R CONSOLE<|>R-ENV<|>The R console is a feature of the r-env module for interactive R sessions on Puhti<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSTUDIO SERVER<|>R-ENV<|>RStudio Server is provided as part of the r-env module on Puhti for web-based R sessions<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH TUNNELING<|>RSTUDIO SERVER<|>SSH tunneling is a method used to securely access RStudio Server on Puhti<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER_WRAPPER<|>R-ENV<|>Apptainer_wrapper is used within the r-env module context to run R scripts in a containerized manner on Puhti<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
