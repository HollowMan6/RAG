Hence, they are not included in\nthe robot search path of EasyBuild so that you don't accidentally try to\ninstall them (and also removed from the search path for `eb -S` or `eb\n--search` to avoid any confusion that they might work).\n\n### Building your own EasyBuild repository\n\nWe advise users to maintain their own repository of EasyConfig files which they\ninstalled in their personal or project space. This may help to rebuild your\nenvironment for a later project on LUMI. It may even be a good idea to keep the\nrepository on a personal GitHub or other version control service.\n\nThe repository is created automatically the first time `EasyBuild-user` is\nloaded. The directory is called `UserRepo` and is in `$EBU_USER_PREFIX` (or the\ndefault location `$HOME/EasyBuild` if you don't set the environment variable).\nIt must be structured similarly to [the main EasyBuild EasyConfig\nrepository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs). The\nEasyBuild recipes (`.eb` files) should be in a subdirectory\n`easybuild/easyconfigs`, leaving room for personal EasyBlocks also (which would\nthen go in the `easybuild/easyblocks` subdirectory) and even personal\nconfiguration files that overwrite some system options. This setup also\nguarantees compatibility with some EasyBuild features for very advanced users\nthat go way beyond this page.\n\nTo store this repository on GitHub, you can follow the GitHub documentation,\nand in particular the page [\"Adding an existing project to GitHub using the\ncommand\nline\"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).\n\nTechnical documentation on the toolchains on LUMI and the directory structure\nof EasyBuild can be found in [the documentation of the LUMI-SoftwareStack\nGitHub repository](https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-SoftwareStack/).\n\n## Further reading\n\nIf you want to get more familiar with EasyBuild and develop your own EasyBuild\nrecipes, we suggest the following sources of information:\n\n- [EasyBuild documentation](https://docs.easybuild.io/)\n- [EasyBuild tutorials](https://tutorial.easybuild.io)\n    - [Tutorial specific for LUMI](https://klust.github.io/easybuild-tutorial/2022-CSC_and_LO/)\n- The [EasyBuild YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@easybuilders)\n  contains recordings of a four-session tutorial\n  given for the LUMI User Support Team by Kenneth Hoste (UGent), the lead developer\n  of EasyBuild and Luca Marsella (CSCS)\n    - [Part 1: Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTRw8hqi6x0)\n    - [Part 2: Using EasyBuild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3S8aCXrIMQ)\n    - [Part 3: Advanced topics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbcvHa4uO1Y)\n    - [Part 4: EasyBuild on Cray systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRu7X_fJotA)\n- [Technical documentation on our setup for developers](https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-SoftwareStack/)\n- LUMI EasyBuild recipes\n    - [Main LUMI software stack GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/LUMI-SoftwareStack)\n      contains the full EasyBuild setup for LUMI, including the EasyBuild recipes\n      that we use for the central software stack and many others that we fully support\n      and consider of good quality. The clone on the system is automatically searched\n      by the `EasyBuild-user` module.\n    - [LUMI contributed EasyBuild recipes GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/LUMI-EasyBuild-contrib)\n      contains contributed EasyBuild recipes and other recipes developed by LUST\n      that haven't been as thoroughly checked or are deemed not appropriate for central\n      installation at this point.
