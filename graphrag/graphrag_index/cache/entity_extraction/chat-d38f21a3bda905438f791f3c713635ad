Note that JAX is\nalso available in the [LUMI Software Library](https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/j/jax/).\n\nSince version 0.4.30, the JAX module comes in two flavours:\n\n- A \"small\" flavour that includes JAX with CUDA 12.2 GPU support, as well as cpu-only versions of\n  PyTorch and Tensorflow to allow using their data loading utilities. These follow the naming scheme\n  `jax/<version>-small`, or you can use `jax/small` to load the default (latest) version.\n- A \"full\" flavour that includes many commonly used machine learning packages building on JAX -- you can\n  check `pip list` for a full list of all included packages. These follow the naming scheme `jax/<version>`,\n  or you can simply use `jax` to load the default (latest) version.\n\n!!! note\n\n    Since JAX releases new versions on a somewhat irregular schedule\n    we will not make all new versions immediately available.\n    Instead we endeavour to update the JAX version available on our systems approximately every six months, targeting February and August, on a best effort basis.\n\nAll modules are based on containers using Apptainer (previously known\nas Singularity). Wrapper scripts have been provided via [tykky](../computing/containers/tykky.md)\nso that common commands such as `python`, `python3`, `pip` and `pip3` and\nthose provided by installed packages should work as normal.\nFor other commands, you may need to prefix them with\n`apptainer_wrapper exec`. For more information, see [CSC's general\ninstructions on how to run Apptainer\ncontainers](../computing/containers/run-existing.md).\n\n\n## Additional packages\n\nIf you find that some package is missing, you can often install it\nyourself using `pip install`. It is recommended to use Python virtual\nenvironments. See [our Python documentation for more information on\nhow to install packages\nyourself](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).\nIf you think that some important package should be included in the\nmodule provided by CSC, please [contact our\nservicedesk](../support/contact.md).\n\n## License\n\nJAX is licensed under [Apache License\n2.0](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the default version (most-recent) on Puhti or Mahti, initialize it with:\n\n```bash\nmodule load jax\n```\n\nTo access CSC-installed JAX on LUMI:\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles/\nmodule load jax\n```\n\n!!! note\n\n    In your scripts we recommend to fix the version so that\n    changes in future upgrades do not break scripts, e.g.,:\n    `module load jax/0.4.23-py3.9`\n\nPlease note that the JAX modules already include the corresponding\nCUDA and cuDNN or ROCm libraries, so **there is no need to load any\ncuda, cudnn, or rocm modules separately!**\n\nThis will show all available versions of JAX:\n\n```bash\nmodule avail jax\n```\n\n!!! note\n\n    Note that the login nodes are not intended for heavy computing,\n    please use slurm batch jobs instead. See our [instructions on how\n    to use the batch job\n    system](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\n!!! note\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
