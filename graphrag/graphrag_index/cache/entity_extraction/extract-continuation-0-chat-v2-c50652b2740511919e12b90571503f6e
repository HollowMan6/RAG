Create a deployment\n2. Create a PVC\n3. Mount the PVC to deployment (in Rahti2 PVC is only created after that is mount to a deployment)\n4. Unmount the PVC from deployment\n5. Create a volume snapshot\n6. Attach the PVC to volume snapshot\n\n### Through web interface\n\nAfter making sure that PVC is not attached to any pod, Navigate to the 'VolumeSnapshot' section and click on 'Create VolumeSnapshot' to create a snapshot of your PVC. \n\n![Create Snap Shot](../../img/CreateSnapshot.png)\n\nTo find volume snapshot, select 'Developer' view, click 'Project' in left hand side menu, in 'Invertory' section of 'Overview' tab last option is VolumeSnapshot. \n\n![Volume Snap Shot](../../img/Volumesnapshot.png)\n\nFill the required details. In PersistentVolumeClaim, select the PVC you want to attach, provide a name to volume snapshot, select the default snapshot class 'standard-csi' and click on 'create'.\n\n![Enter the details of Snap Shot](../../img/EnterSnapshotDetails.png)\n\n\n### Using CLI\n\nCreate `snapshot.yaml` file to attach PVC to volume snapshot\n\n```\napiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1\nkind: VolumeSnapshot\nmetadata:\n  name: <name_of_volumesnapshot>\nspec:\n  source:\n    persistentVolumeClaimName: <name_of_PVC>\n  volumeSnapshotClassName: standard-csi\n```\nRun `oc apply -f  snapshot.yaml` to deploy the `snapshot.yaml`.\n\nTo list all the volume snapshots, use the command:\n\n`oc get volumesnapshot`\n\nTo get the details of the volume snapshot that was created, enter the following command:\n\n`oc describe volumesnapshot <your-volume-snapshot>`\n\nDelete the volume snapshot by entering the following command:\n\n`oc delete volumesnapshot <volumesnapshot_name>`\n\n## Restore a volume snapshot\n\nCSI Snapshot Controller Operator creates the following snapshot custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1 API group. The VolumeSnapshot CRD content can be used to restore the existing volume to a previous state. Create a `pvc-restore.yaml` file.\n\n``` \napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: myclaim-restore\nspec:\n  storageClassName: csi-hostpath-sc\n  dataSource:\n    name: <name-of-snapshot> \n    kind: VolumeSnapshot \n    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io \n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n```\nRun `oc apply -f pvc-restore.yaml` to deploy the `pvc-restore.yaml`.\n\nHere, in `spec.dataSource.name`, the name of the snapshot to use as source is provided.\n\n## Use Case\n\nHere, we are taking snapshot of the content for nginx deployment and bucking up the data by the restore script. Follow the steps:\n\n1. Create an nginx deployment `nginx-deployment.yaml`.\n2. Create a PVC name `nginx-pvc.yaml`.\n3. Attach this PVC to the ngninx deployment.\n4. Go to the pod created for this deployment and create a file name test.txt and add static content to the it. This content will be stored on the PVC created earlier.\n5. Save the snapshot definition in a file named `nginx-snapshot.yaml`. This file should reference the PVC used by Nginx (as specified in `nginx-pvc.yaml`).\n6. Delete the PVC.\n7. Create a new PVC from the snapshot by saving the new PVC configuration in `nginx-restore-pvc.yaml`. This file should specify that the data source is the snapshot created in the previous step.\n8. Deploy a new instance of Nginx using the restored PVC with a modified deployment configuration saved in `nginx-restored-deployment.yaml`. This new deployment will use the PVC created from the snapshot, allowing it to serve the previously added static content.\n9. You can see that the data is restored.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti2 offers methods for provisioning snapshots through a web interface and CLI, catering to users with active projects needing volume snapshot services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLUME SNAPSHOT<|>EVENT<|>A volume snapshot is a data storage event where a snapshot of a persistent volume claim (PVC) is taken to preserve its state at a specific point in time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUME CLAIM (PVC)<|>EVENT<|>A claim to a persistent volume that is used in Kubernetes environments, allowing users to store data persistently across pod reassignments and restarts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSI SNAPSHOT CONTROLLER OPERATOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An operator in Kubernetes that manages the lifecycle of volume snapshots and restores them as per user requests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGINX DEPLOYMENT<|>EVENT<|>A deployment process involving the Nginx web server, where a PVC is attached, and static content is served from the volume)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI2<|>VOLUME SNAPSHOT<|>Rahti2 provides the infrastructure and methods for creating volume snapshots<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLUME SNAPSHOT<|>PERSISTENT VOLUME CLAIM (PVC)<|>Volume snapshots are directly created from persistent volume claims (PVCs) to capture their data state<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSI SNAPSHOT CONTROLLER OPERATOR<|>VOLUME SNAPSHOT<|>The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator is responsible for creating and managing volume snapshots<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGINX DEPLOYMENT<|>PERSISTENT VOLUME CLAIM (PVC)<|>The Nginx deployment process involves creating a PVC to store static content<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGINX DEPLOYMENT<|>VOLUME SNAPSHOT<|>A volume snapshot is used to backup and restore the data for an Nginx deployment<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
