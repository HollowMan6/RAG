The procedure\nis shown in [a video](../../apps/maestro.md#standalone-usage-on-puhti) on our\nmain Maestro page. Use e.g. `scp` on your local machine to copy the inputs to\nPuhti (edit your username and project accordingly):\n\n```bash\nscp -r my_job <your username>@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/<your project>\n```\n\nNote that `scp` works also in Windows PowerShell. See\n[Moving data between CSC and local workstation](../../data/moving/index.md) for\nother alternatives.\n\nOnce the folder `my_job` containing all input files has been copied:\n\n1. SSH to Puhti.\n2. Load the Maestro module.\n3. Go to the input directory.\n\n```bash\nssh <your username>@puhti.csc.fi\nmodule load maestro\ncd /scratch/<your project>/my_job\n```\n\nThe job is submitted to a compute node(s) by running the `job_name.sh` script\nwritten out by Maestro. It will formulate the task(s) as Slurm batch job(s) and\nask resources according to the selected HOST in your `schrodinger.hosts` file in\nyour Puhti `$HOME` directory.\n\n```bash\nbash job_name.sh  # note the usage of `bash`, not `sbatch`!\n```\n\nOnce the simulation has finished, copy the outputs back to your local computer\nfor analysis. On your local machine, run e.g. `scp` again:\n\n```bash\nscp -r <your username>@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/<your project>/my_job .\n```\n\nNote that you can also use e.g. the [Puhti web interface](../../data/moving/web-interface.md)\nfor copying files between Puhti and your local computer.\n\nAnother more advanced version is to use e.g. the `pipeline` tool which allows\nyou to bypass some of the Schrödinger jobcontrol machinery, but requires you to\nwrite the job script yourself. This may be useful in case some of your subjobs\nterminate unexpectedly. In this case, please make note of those JobIds and\n[contact us](../contact.md).\n\nThe remainder of this article explains some implementation details on Puhti\nand helps setting up efficient simulation workflows.\n\n## Maestro `schrodinger.hosts` file\n\nThis file specifies the resources your jobs can get either locally\nor from the queuing system. To use the recommended procedure\nyou need to edit the local (on your computer) `schrodinger.hosts` file to\ninclude the same HOSTs that you want to use on Puhti. On Windows, this will\nrequire admin privileges.\n\nOn Puhti, Maestro complains about the location of this file, but ignore it,\nit's ok. The file is created by a script (echoed on your screen when you give\n`module load maestro`) that you need to run if the file does not exist.\n\nAs the script requests, select the computing project that will be used for\nCPU/GPU usage and scratch storage. You can find the actual Slurm options\nin the HOST descriptions in the `schrodinger.hosts` file. If your jobs require\nresources that are not satisfied by any of the predefined HOST descriptions,\nfeel free to edit the file.\n\nOn Puhti, you can take a look at the `schrodinger.hosts` file with:\n\n```bash\nless $HOME/schrodinger.hosts\n```\n\nOn your local computer this file will be in the Maestro installation directory,\ne.g. on Windows in `C:\\Program Files\\Schrodinger-version\\schrodinger.hosts`\n\nAfter the longish header and the `localhost` entry, you should see the\nPuhti HOST entries as something like:\n\n```bash\nname:        test\nqueue:       SLURM2.1\nqargs:       -p test -t 00:10:00 --mem-per-cpu=2000 --account=project_2042424\nhost:        puhti-login11\nprocessors:  4\n```\n\nFor example, this HOST entry, available for Schrödinger jobs as _test_ (from `name: test`),\nwill use the Slurm partition _test_ (from `-p test`), allocate a maximum of 10 minutes of time,\n2 GB of memory and consume resources from Project_2042424. If you need different resources you\ncan edit this file e.g. by adding a new entry. The requests must be within the\n[partition limits](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md).\n\nIf your `schrodinger.hosts` file **on Puhti** does not have the `--account=<project>` defined,\ndelete the file and rerun the script to create it (`module load maestro` will print out the\npath to the script, copy/paste it to the command line). You don't need to have the\n`--account=` option set in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC MAESTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC Maestro is a software tool for running computational jobs, including a GUI, on compute nodes via a queuing system on Puhti\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer at CSC that runs Maestro jobs and other computational tasks\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHRODINGER.HOSTS FILE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A configuration file for Maestro that specifies resources for jobs either locally or from the queuing system\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC MAESTRO<|>PUHTI<|>Maestro jobs are run on Puhti's compute nodes via a queuing system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHRODINGER.HOSTS FILE<|>CSC MAESTRO<|>The schrodinger.hosts file configures Maestro to use specific resources on Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHRODINGER.HOSTS FILE<|>PUHTI<|>The schrodinger.hosts file includes HOST entries for running Schrödinger jobs on Puhti<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
