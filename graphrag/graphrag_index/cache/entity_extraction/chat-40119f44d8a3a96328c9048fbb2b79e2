Each disk area has its own specific purpose.\n\n💬 Active data files needed for computational simulations and analyses should be stored and shared in directories under `/scratch` while any software installations and binaries should be shared under the `/projappl` directory.\n\n## Identify your personal and project-specific directories on Puhti and Mahti supercomputers\n\n1. First login to Puhti using SSH (or by opening a login node shell in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)):\n  \n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi    # replace <username> with your CSC username, e.g. myname@puhti.csc.fi\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Get an overview of your projects and directories by running the following commands on the login node:\n\n```bash\ncsc-projects\ncsc-workspaces\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Inspect the output information summarizing your directories and their current quotas.\n4. Visit your project's `/scratch` directory and list its contents:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/<project>/   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\nls\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Visit your project's `/projappl` directory and list its contents:\n\n```bash\ncd /projappl/<project>/   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\nls\n```\n\n💬 These directories can be briefly summarized as follows:\n\n- User-specific directory (i.e. your personal home folder)\n   - Your home directory (path stored in environment variable `$HOME`)\n   - The default directory when you login to Puhti/Mahti\n   - You can store configuration files and other minor data for personal use\n- Project-specific directories:\n   - The project's `/scratch` and `/projappl` directories\n   - Each project has its own `/scratch` disk space where most computational tasks are performed. The `/scratch` area is a temporary space not intended for long-term data storage! Please move inactive data to e.g. [Allas](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/).\n   - `/projappl` directory on the other hand is mainly for storing and sharing compiled applications and libraries etc. with other members of the project.\n\n## Sharing binaries and data files\n\n💬 Data transfer between two supercomputers can be done e.g. with `rsync`.\n\n### Download the example files\n\n☝🏻 In this example you will *download* data from [Allas](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/) object storage, but keep in mind that one should avoid using Allas to do data transfer between Puhti and Mahti.\n\n1. Move to your home folder:\n\n```bash\ncd\n```\n\n💡 If you know the files are large, you should consider downloading them directly to `/scratch`.\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Download an example program package (`ggplot2_3.3.3_Rprogramme.tar.gz`) and a data file (`Merged.fasta`) from the Allas object storage\n  \n```bash\nwget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/shared_files.tar.gz\ntar -xavf shared_files.tar.gz\ncd shared_files\n```\n\nLet's assume that\n\n- `Merged.fasta` is a data file intended for computational use\n- `ggplot2_3.3.3_Rprogramme.tar.gz` is a software tool needed for the analysis.\n\n### Move the files to Puhti `/scratch` and `/projappl`\n\n1. Create folders with your username (using environment variable `$USER`) in your project directories under `/scratch` and `/projappl` on Puhti.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /projappl/<project>/$USER   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\nmkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Copy your `ggplot2_3.3.3_Rprogramme.tar.gz` file to the `/projappl` directory\n\n```bash\ncp ggplot2_3.3.3_Rprogramme.tar.gz  /projappl/<project>/$USER/   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Copy the `Merged.fasta` file to the `/scratch` directory\n\n```bash\ncp Merged.fasta /scratch/<project>/$USER/    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n- Note that all new files and directories are also fully accessible to other members of the project (including read\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
