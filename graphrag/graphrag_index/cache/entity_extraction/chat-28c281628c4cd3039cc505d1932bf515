If you want the volume to be available after rebooting the virtual machine, you need to add it in the `/etc/fstab` configuration file.\nYou can use the label you previously created for the partition:\n\n    sudo sh -c 'echo \"/dev/vdb     /media/volume    xfs    defaults,nofail    0    2\" >> /etc/fstab'\n\n## Detaching the volume using web interface\n\nOnce you are done with your operations and you want to detach the volume, please remember to unmount the volume before detaching it!\n\n    sudo umount /dev/vdb\n\n## Detaching the volume using CLI\n\nWhen you no longer need the volume to be attached, you can detach\nit. **Before detaching, remember to unmount the volume's filesystem on\nthe virtual machine to avoid data loss!**\n\n```\nopenstack server remove volume <server> <volume>\n```\n\nIf you want to delete a volume and the data contained on it, you can execute:\n\n```\nopenstack volume delete <volume> # Name or ID of volume\n```\n\n**The data will be deleted forever, it cannot be recovered**.\n\n## Transferring volumes between two Pouta projects using web interface\n\nOccasionally, you may need to transfer your persistent\nvolumes between two Pouta projects. For example, you may need to transfer\nlarge data sets or bootable volumes to colleagues in another Pouta\nproject. This can be done using volume transfers. Volume transfers\nbetween projects in Pouta are fast, avoid data duplication and\nunnecessary data transfers over the network. Transferring a volume to\nanother project means that your project will no longer have access to it.\nPlease note Pouta volume transfer works within the same cloud environment\ni.e. you can transfer a volume from one cPouta project to another but\nnot between a cPouta project and ePouta project or vice versa.\n\nTo transfer a volume, you must first make sure its status\nis **Available**. You can do so by detaching it from the instance\nto which it was initially attached. Once your volume is in the available\nstatus, you can initiate volume transfer either using Pouta Web or\nthe command line interface.\n\nFor the Pouta Web interface, go to the *Volumes* view and click the arrow symbol\nnext to the **Edit Volume** button of the volume you want to transfer and\nselect **Create Transfer.** Name this transfer request and\nclick on **Create Volume Transfer.** You will then get the volume transfer\ncredentials (transfer ID & authorization key).\n\n![Transfer a volume to another project](../../img/pouta-volume-transfer-creation.png)\n\nYou need to provide these credentials to your colleague to whom you\nwant to transfer this volume.\n\nYour colleague can accept this volume transfer in his project by going\nto his *Volumes* view of the web interface and clicking the **Accept\nTransfer** button. They need to then provide the transfer credentials\nyou generated in the previous step and **Accept Volume Transfer.**\nThis will transfer the volume to your colleague's project.\n\n![Accept volume transfer](../../img/pouta-accept-volume-transfer.png)\n\n## Transferring volumes between two Pouta projects using CLI\n\nVolume transfers can be also done using the command line interface:\n\n    openstack volume transfer request create <name or UUID of volume to transfer>\n\nThe output of this command will have the volume transfer credentials\n(transfer ID  & Authorization key), note these down and pass these to your\ncolleague to whom you want to transfer the volume.\n\nYour colleague can accept the transfer request of this volume:\n\n    openstack volume transfer request accept <transferID> <authKey>\n\n## Expanding size of the attached volume in the Pouta web interface\n\nPreviously you have created and attached a volume. In this section you are going to enlarge the size of the volume attached to the instance. Before you attempt for volume expansion you have to detach the volume from the instance, please remember to unmount the volume before detaching it!\n\n    sudo umount /dev/vdb\n\nTo expand the volume, first select the *Volumes* view in the Pouta web interface. Click the arrow symbol next to the **Edit Volume** button for the volume you want to enlarge and select **Extend Volume**. Input the volume amount you want in \"GiB\" in the field **New Size (GiB)**. Finally, click the **Extend Volume** button.\nTo attach an expanded volume similar to the previous attach persistent volume, first select the *Volumes* view in the Pouta web interface. Click the arrow symbol next to the **Edit Volume** button for the volume you expanded and select **Manage attachments**. Select the instance (i.e. virtual machine) you want to attach the volume to in the **Attach to Instance** selector.\n\n![Expand persistent volume](../../img/volume-expand-horizon1.png)\n\nOnce you have logged in to your virtual machine, you can list the\nvolumes:\n\n    sudo parted -l\n\nSimilar to the previous persistent volume creation you can identify the volume based on its size. First mount the volume at the usual path:\n\n    sudo mount /dev/vdb /media/volume\n\nFinally we need to grow the filesystem of the volume, so that the additional space can be used. Assuming that the filesystem in the volume is xfs, we can grow the filesystem with the following command:\n\n    sudo xfs_growfs /dev/vdb\n    \nTo verify that the filesystem has now the expected size, you can use the following command:\n\n    sudo xfs_info /dev/vdb\n\nBy multiplying the block size (_bs_) by the number of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
