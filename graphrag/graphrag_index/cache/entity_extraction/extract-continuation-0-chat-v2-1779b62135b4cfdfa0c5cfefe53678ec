This workspace is powered by a type of operating system called Linux, and you can choose between two versions: Ubuntu 22 or CentOS 7 (dismissed in 2024). \nThe virtual desktop comes with some basic tools or software that you can use right away (listed below). However, this basic toolkit provides you a rather limited set of open-source software. \n\nThe virtual desktop can also become a versatile research workspace designed to adapt to your specific needs **via customization with**:\n\n* [SD Software installer](../../data/sensitive-data/sd-desktop-software.md#sd-software-installer): A simple application for easy software additions and customization. \n\n* [Apptainer and Podman](../../data/sensitive-data/sd-desktop-software.md#software-customisation-with-apptainer-and-podman): For those with technical expertise, create customized containers for specialized software setups (advanced). \n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) if you have any questions about the software selection (subject: Sensitive Data). We can support you in your Desktop customization. Moreover, we are working on developing our services to provide proprietary software. Follow our webpage for constant updates. \n\n\n\n## Default software selection in SD Desktop\n\nBelow we list some of the most commonly used tools that are by default installed in SD Desktop machines.\nThe list is not complete and there are small differences between different linux flavours.\n\n### Office tools\n   - [LibreOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice)\n\n### Programming\n  - [go](https://go.dev/)\n  - [Python3](./tutorials/sd-pythonlibs.md) including packages: tensorflow, nltk, spacy, scikit-learn, seaborn, plotly, bokeh, pydot, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, eli5, torch, keras, dist-keras, elephas, gensim, scrapy, beautifulsoup4, numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, pyfuse3, crypt4gh, trio, httpx, qrcode\n  - [R / RStudio Server](./sd-desktop-access.md#accessing-rstudio)\n     - Matching the r-env-singularity/4.0.5 module on Puhti (R 4.0.5 + RStudio Server 1.4.1106, Bioconductor 3.12)\n     - 1000+ pre-installed R packages (versions available on Apr 20, 2021)\n     - Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL)\n     - GIS software (PROJ, GDAL, SAGA)\n     - CUDA drivers\n     - TensorFlow (used with R TensorFlow back-end)\n     - R + RStudio Server versions matched with Puhti r-env-singularity module (R 4.0.5 + RStudio Server 1.4.1106, MRAN, Bioconductor 3.12)  \n\n### Workflow engines\n   - [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)\n   - [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n\n### Software containers\n   - [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)\n   - [Podman](https://podman.io/) Only in Ubuntu machines.\n   \n### Scientific Software\n   - [Plink 1.9](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/)\n   - [Samtools 1.8](http://www.htslib.org/)\n   - [Minimap2 2.26](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)\n\n### Terminals and interfaces\n   - [Byobu](https://www.byobu.org/) (Only in Ubuntu machines.)\n   - [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)\n\n\n## Adding software: background information\n\nThe virtual desktops (or virtual machines) are intentionally isolated from the internet for security reasons. Consequently, the process of adding supplementary software and libraries is not straightforward. The absence of a network connection precludes the use of conventional installation tools such as _git_, _coda_, _cpan_ or _pip_ in their typical fashion, as these tools rely on external repositories. Furthermore, users on the SD Desktop do not possess the necessary superuser access to execute operations requiring elevated permissions.\nAdding extra software to SD Desktop is possible, but it involves converting the installation steps into special files. These files are then uploaded to SD Connect and copied to your SD Desktop for installation. For this process, we recommend using Apptainer containers for importing the software you need, but Apptainer is not the only option. You can also import software for example as Appimage files, Ubuntu 22.04 compatible binaries or as source code.\n\n\n### SD Software installer\n\n[SD Software installer](./tutorials/sd-software-installer.md) provides an easy-to-use tool to add some commonly used software to SD Desktop (Eg. Rstudio 4.2.2, Whisper, VSCode and GATK). SD Software installer is based on installation scripts provided by CSC. Users can't add their own tools to the SD Software installer, but you can send requests for new tools to be added. \n\n   - [SD Software installer](./tutorials/sd-software-installer.md)\n \n   \n### Software customisation with Apptainer and Podman\n\nIf you want to add new software to your virtual machine independently, the most convenient way is to build an Apptainer container outside SD Desktop and then import the container through SD Connect to SD Desktop. The two documents below describe two sample cases on adding software with containers.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is an operating system that powers the virtual desktop environment, offering versions such as Ubuntu 22 and CentOS 7\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU 22<|>GEO<|>One of the Linux operating system versions available for the virtual desktop\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS 7<|>GEO<|>One of the Linux operating system versions available for the virtual desktop, which will be dismissed in 2024\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD SOFTWARE INSTALLER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A simple application for easy software additions and customization on the virtual desktop\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for creating customized containers for specialized software setups on the virtual desktop\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODMAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for managing containers on the virtual desktop, used alongside Apptainer for software customization\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The support service for users of the virtual desktop, offering help with software selection and customization\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBREOFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An office suite pre-installed on SD Desktop machines for productivity tasks\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language included in the default software selection of SD Desktop machines\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language with various packages pre-installed on SD Desktop machines for data science and development\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R / RSTUDIO SERVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment for statistical computing and graphics, including RStudio Server, pre-installed on SD Desktop machines\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXTFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A workflow engine pre-installed on SD Desktop machines for pipeline development\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A workflow engine pre-installed on SD Desktop machines for creating reproducible and scalable data analyses\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLINK 1.9<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A scientific software tool pre-installed on SD Desktop machines for whole genome association analysis\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMTOOLS 1.8<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data, pre-installed on SD Desktop machines\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINIMAP2 2.26<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program for aligning sequencing reads or assembly contigs to large reference databases, pre-installed on SD Desktop machines\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BYOBU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer, available only on Ubuntu machines within SD Desktop\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, pre-installed on SD Desktop machines\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UBUNTU 22<|>PODMAN<|>Podman is only available in Ubuntu machines on the virtual desktop<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UBUNTU 22<|>BYOBU<|>Byobu is only available in Ubuntu machines within SD Desktop<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>SD SOFTWARE INSTALLER<|>Apptainer, alongside SD Software Installer, is recommended for adding new software to the virtual desktop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODMAN<|>SD SOFTWARE INSTALLER<|>Podman, alongside SD Software Installer, is used for software customization on the virtual desktop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>SD SOFTWARE INSTALLER<|>CSC Service Desk supports users in customizing their desktop, potentially involving the use of SD Software Installer<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
