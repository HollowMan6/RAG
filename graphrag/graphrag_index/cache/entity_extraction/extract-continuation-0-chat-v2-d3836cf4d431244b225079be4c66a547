It is used for instance in making DEMs, DSMs, point clouds and orthophotos photogrammetrically.\n\n## Available\n\n__OpenDroneMap__ is available in Puhti with following versions:\n\n* 3.0.4\n* 2.8.8\n\n## Usage\nOpenDroneMap is available in Puhti as a [Singularity](../computing/containers/run-existing.md) container\n\nTo run OpenDroneMap: \n1) Copy your aerial images to Puhti. OpenDroneMap requires the folder names to end with `code/images`, for example `/scratch/project_2000XXX/odm/code/images`.\n2) Write a batch job script (see below)\n3) Submit your OpenDroneMap batch job. \n\n* According to our tests, a project with ~300 images is optimal to run with 8-12 CPU cores; adjust the number of CPUs on the `--cpus-per-task` line. OpenDroneMap can use only one computing node in processing which means that it is limited to a maximum of 40 CPU cores per job.\n* `--project-path` - the place where images are stored, without the `code/images` part.\n* `--max-concurrency` - the number of threads used in several steps of ODM processing, here set to same number as reserved cores. \n* It is possible to add [additional arguments](https://docs.opendronemap.org/arguments/) to the end of the command. \n* If your images cover a very large area, see [ODM Splitting Large Datasets documentation](https://docs.opendronemap.org/large/)\nBelow you can find an example batch job script. Adjust `--account`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--time` and `--mem-per-cpu` to your needs.\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<YOUR-CSC-PROJECT>\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3G\n\nmodule load opendronemap\napptainer_wrapper run --project-path /scratch/project_2000XXX/odm --max-concurrency $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n```\n\n3) Outputs are available in `code`-folder, for example `/scratch/project_2000XXX/odm/code`\n\n### OpenDroneMap with compute node's local NMVE disk\nOpenDroneMap reads and writes a lot to disk, so running it is slightly (~15%) faster using [compute node's local NMVE disk](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#local-storage). Below is example file for using OpenDroneMap with NMVE disk.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<YOUR-CSC-PROJECT>\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3G\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:30\n\n#ODM project folder, that has code/images folder.\nodm_dir=/scratch/project_2000599/odm/\n\necho \"Copying input images from Puhti scratch to compute node local disk\"\nrsync -r $odm_dir/code $LOCAL_SCRATCH\n\nmodule load opendronemap\napptainer_wrapper run --project-path $LOCAL_SCRATCH --max-concurrency $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n\necho \"Copying outputs from Puhti scratch to compute node local disk\"\nrsync -r $LOCAL_SCRATCH/* $odm_dir\n```\n\n\n## License \n\nOpenDroneMap is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.
