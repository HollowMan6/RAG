This process in continued until the best set of hyperparameters remain. Hyperband addresses the static nature of successive halving by dynamically allocating the amount budget to hyperparameters during iterations, using successive halving as a subroutine for selecting the suitable hyperparameters.\n\n\n### Metaheuristics\n\n*Metaheuristics* are a set of search methods that can cope with difficult constraints, such as nonconvexity, noncontinuous and nonsmooth functions. In theory, metaheuristics can do better approximations to a global optimum (if a true optimum exists) for large scale models. For hyperparameter search, popular metaheuristic approaches are *evolutionary computation* and *particle swarm* approaches: in evolutionary computation, a set of initial, random hyperparameters are evaluated, then mutated and selected according to a fitness function; particle swarm approaches work in a similar manner, but searching for hyperparameters is done in a semi-collective manner: each hyperparameter is individually evaluated and then information is shared between all hyperparameters to direct the search for a new set of hyperparameters. \n\n## Software for hyperparameter search\n\nThis documentation is biased towards the Python programming languages. We present here software packages which have a clearer API, documentation and are suitable usage in CSC's computing infrastructure.\n\nDue to package dependencies, you should load the python-data module with the latest python version:\n\n```bash\nmodule load python-data/3.9-1\n```\n\n\n#### Scikit-learn\n\nWhen Grid or Random search is a suitable option for hyperparameter search, **Scikit-learn** has implementations of both Grid and Random search with cross-validation. Cross-validation is its own model selection process, and is highly dependent on the amount of available data and, for example, the number of folds to use (number of folds and train/test data split are dependent variables). Note that if you are testing a *larger number* of possible models, you will be in risk of getting an overfitted model.\n\n```python\n# Scikit-learn \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV\nhyperparams = { ... } # list of hyperparameters with their ranges and options\n\ngridsearch   = GridSearchCV( model, hyperparams, ... )\n\n... = # Define data splits\n\ngridsearch.fit( Xtrain, ytrain )\n```\n\n#### Optuna\n\n**Optuna** is a model agnostic library for hyperparameter search. In addition to Grid and Random search, Optuna implements Tree-structured Parzen estimator and CMA-ES sampling methods for searching hyperparameters, and additionally you can implement your own custom sampler methods. To make searching more efficient, multifidelity search can be done with Optuna, with Median or Threshold as an additional pruning option of the search space. \n\n```python\n# Optuna\nimport optuna\nmodel       = ... # Define model\nhyperparams = { ... }\n\ngridsearch = optuna.create_study( sampler = optuna.samplers.GridSampler( params ) )\ngridsearch.optimize( model )\n```\n\n#### Scikit-optimize\n\n**Scikit-optimize** implements adaptive search strategies and is built on top f scikit-learn. This makes it easy to implement right on top of models built using scikit-learn.\n\n```python\n# Scikit-optimize using Scikit-learn models\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\nmodel = GradientBoostingClassifier()  # Define GradientBoosting\n\nfrom skopt.space import Real, Integer\nfrom skopt.utils import use_name_args\n\nhyperparams = [ Integer( 1, 5, name = 'max_depth' ),\n\t\t        Real( 10 ** -5, 10 ** 0, 'log-uniform', name = 'learning_rate' ) \n\t          ]\n\n@used_named_args( space )\ndef objective( **hyperparams ):\n\tmodel.set_params( **hyperparams )\n\treturn -( np.mean( cross_val_score( model, X, y, cv = 3, n_jobs = -1, scoring = 'neg_mean_absolute_error' ) )\n\n# Execute Gaussian Process\nfrom skopt import gp_minimize\n\nmodel_gp = gp_minimize( objective, hyperparams, n_class = 50, random_state = 123 )\n```\n\n#### Ray\n\nFor the case you would like to enable parallel model selection, *Ray* offers an efficient wrappers for various Python packages. In case you need packages that are not included in the python-data module, use\n```python\npip install --user <package-name>\n```\nIf you want to use Ray to parallelize models build with scikit-learn, the easiest way is to use **tune-sklearn** package. With tune-sklearn, you will get better parallelization performance using Ray, instead of using **n_jobs = -1** argument within GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV functions. Here's is an example using **TuneGridSearchCV** with models using scikit-learn:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.tune.sklearn import TuneGridSearchCV\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\n\n\nmodel               = SGDClassifier()\nhyperparameter_grid = { \"loss\": [ 'hinge', 'log', 'modified_huber', 'squared_hinge', 'perceptron' ],\n                        \"max_iter\": [ 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 ],\n                        \"n_iter_no_change\": [ 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 60 ] \n                      }\n\ntune_search = TuneGridSearchCV( model, hyperparameter_grid, early_stopping = True, max_iters = 10, \n                                use_gpu =\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYPERBAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hyperband is a method for hyperparameter optimization that dynamically allocates resources to configurations to find the best set of hyperparameters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METAHEURISTICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Metaheuristics are search methods used for solving complex optimization problems, including hyperparameter search in machine learning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A metaheuristic approach for hyperparameter search that involves mutation and selection of hyperparameters based on a fitness function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTICLE SWARM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A metaheuristic search method where hyperparameter search is conducted in a semi-collective manner with shared information among parameters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIKIT-LEARN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Python library that provides implementations of Grid and Random search with cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTUNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A model agnostic library for hyperparameter search that implements various sampling methods and allows for multifidelity search with pruning options)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIKIT-OPTIMIZE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library built on top of scikit-learn that implements adaptive search strategies for hyperparameter optimization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software that offers efficient wrappers for parallel model selection in Python, compatible with various libraries including scikit-learn)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUNE-GRIDSEARCHCV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A component of tune-sklearn package that allows for better parallelization performance using Ray for hyperparameter optimization)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION<|>METAHEURISTICS<|>Evolutionary computation is a type of metaheuristic approach for hyperparameter search<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARTICLE SWARM<|>METAHEURISTICS<|>Particle swarm is a type of metaheuristic approach for hyperparameter search<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCIKIT-LEARN<|>HYPERBAND<|>Scikit-learn is a library that can be used for hyperparameter optimization, a problem Hyperband addresses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTUNA<|>HYPERBAND<|>Optuna is a library for hyperparameter search, similar to the problem Hyperband solves<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCIKIT-OPTIMIZE<|>HYPERBAND<|>Scikit-optimize is a library for hyperparameter optimization, addressing similar issues as Hyperband<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAY<|>TUNE-GRIDSEARCHCV<|>Ray is the software that enables the parallelization capabilities of TuneGridSearchCV<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
