You are manager of research team or work independently.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. [Create a CSC account](#1-create-a-csc-account)\n2. [Create new CSC project](#2-create-new-csc-project)\n3. [Fill the GDPR document](#3-fill-the-gdpr-document)\n4. [Activate SD Services for your project](#4-activate-sd-services-for-your-project)\n5. [Apply resources (billing units) for your project](#5-apply-billing-units-for-your-project)\n6. [Activate MFA Authentication](#6-activate-mfa-authentication)\n7. [If you have a research team, add them to be your project members](#7-if-you-have-a-research-team-add-them-to-be-your-project-members)\n8. [Log into SD Services](#8-closing-your-project)\n\n![How to get started as project manager.](images/MyCSC/HowToGetStarted_SD_Project_Manager.png)\n\n\n## Step by step tutorial\n\n### 1. Create a CSC account\n    \n- **Go to [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi){ target=\"_blank\" }**\n- Log in with Virtu or Haka depending on which federation your home organization is a member of. Select your home organization and log in to their identity service. [How to get an account without Haka or Virtu](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md#getting-an-account-without-haka-or-virtu). \n- Fill in your information on the Sign up page.\n- Set your password using 12 characters or more, containing both upper and lowercase letters and at least one number. No special characters are allowed.\n - You will receive your CSC user account confirmation via email.\n\n### 2. Create new CSC project\n\n- Go to ”Projects” page (left side menu or a hamburger menu at the top right corner).\n- On the top of the page choose **”New project”**\n- Fill in the project name and project description. You can edit these later if needed.\n- Choose the Project category to be **“Academic”** (if you are a researcher and a member of Finnish higher education institution)\n- Fill all required fields. Read and accept the terms of use.\n- Click **“Create a project”**.\n\n![Click create a project.](./images/MyCSC/MyCSC_NewProject.png)\n\n\n### 3. Fill the GDPR document\n\n- Since your project handles personal data, you need to fill the GDPR document i.e. *Description of processing activity* -form.\n- The document appears when you create a new project. You can edit this document later.\n- Please check with your home organization  who is the **data controller** (CSC is the data processor, never the controller). [Read more about the roles and GDPR](../../support/faq/sensitive-data-legal.md#what-are-the-roles-of-csc-and-its-service-users-under-gdpr).\n\n![Personal data handling document.](https://a3s.fi/docs-files/sensitive-data/MyCSC/MyCSC_GDPR.png)\n\n### 4. Activate SD Services for your project\n\n- Services are listed in **Services** window in the bottom right of the project page.\n- Select **Allas** (You need Allas to use SD Connect).\n- Read and accept the terms of use and click **“Add service”**.\n- Select **SD Desktop** and add it also.\n\n![Add new services.](./images/MyCSC/MyCSC_AddServices.png)\n\n\n### 5. Apply billing units for your project\n\n- CSC project consumes billing units (BU's). \n- All new academic CSC projects are initially granted 10 000 BU's, so you can get started. However, you should estimate how many BU’s your project will consume **during 1 year** and apply more if needed. When you start a new project, you should plan ahead for your [project's billing unit and storage usage](sd-csc-project.md).\n- Use the [billing unit calculator](sd-csc-project.md#billing-unit-calculator-for-estimating-billing-units-consumption) for estimating your billing unit consumption.\n- Apply more billing units by clicking **\"Apply for resources\"** in Resource applications window.\n- You will get more info after your application to your MyCSC inbox.\n- You can always ask help from [Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) *Subject: Sensitive Data*\n\n![Click apply for resources.](./images/MyCSC/MyCSC_AddResources.png)\n\n\n### 6. Activate MFA Authentication\n\n- You need to activate MFA (multi-factor authentication) to be able to log in the Sensitive Data services. [More about multi-factor authentication](../../accounts/mfa.md).\n- Before activating MFA you need to have some authentication application in your mobile, for example Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator.\n- Go to the **Profile** page (Left side menu or top right hamburger menu).\n- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication by clicking **“Activate”**.\n- This will create a QR code which you can read with your authentication application (for example Google Authenticator).\n- You authentication application will provide a verification code which you can now write to MyCSC **“Verification code”** field and click **“Verify”**.\n\n![Multi-Factor Authentication.](./images/MyCSC/MyCSC_MFA.png)\n\n\n### 7. If you have a research team, add them to be your project members\n\n- Go to project page and select the correct project (Left side\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
