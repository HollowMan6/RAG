The command requires two arguments:\n\n1. the name of the directory where the file is looked for\n2. the search condition\n\nThe basic syntax of the command is:\n\n```bash\nfind directory search_condition \n```\n\nThe search condition is normally based on the name of the file\n(`-name value`), but you can also use options that refer to dates\nor access settings. The `find` command can also have a third argument\nthat defines what operation is performed on the found files. The\ndefault action that is used if no command argument is given is\n`-print`, which prints the path and name of the matching files.\nThe following sample command would look for a file called `dataset27.dat` from\nthe current directory. In this case, the file is found from a subdirectory\n`dataset3`.\n\n```bash\n$ find ./ -name dataset27.txt\n./dataset3/dataset27.txt\n```\n\nYou can also use *wildcards* in the name search conditions. Note,\nhowever, that in such case you must quote the search condition. The following\ncommand locates from your home directory (`$HOME`) all files that have\nextension `.tmp`.\n\n```bash\nfind $HOME/ -name \"*.tmp\"\n```\n\nIn the last find command examples we use `-mtime` search condition,\nwhich picks files based on their modification date.Â With the following\ncommand you can check what files have not been accessed in directory\n`/scratch/project_2001234` during the last 28 days:\n\n```bash\nfind /scratch/project_2001234 -mtime +28\n```\n\nHere `+28` means \"more than 28 days\". In the same way minus-character\n(`-`) means *less than*. So to see what files have been\nmodified in your current directory less than 24 hours ago, you could use the\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nfind ./ -mtime -1\n```\n\n## File command tells the file type\n\nThe `file` command evaluates the type of the given file. The syntax\nof the command is:\n\n```bash\nfile file_name\n```\n\nThe command prints the name of the file and a one-line description of\nthe file type. The `file` command recognizes most common text file\nformats, compressed files and Linux executables. It also studies the\ncontent of the file and tries to estimate e.g. if a normal text file\ncontains program code or some commonly used data formatting types like\nXML. Note however that `file` often fails to classify correctly\napplication-specific files. If the file is a binary file that is not\nrecognized by the `file` command, it is reported to be a *data* file.\n\nIn the example below, file types of all the files in the current working\ndirectory are listed.\n\n```bash\n$ file ./*\n./a.out:                   ELF 64-bit MSB MIPS-IV executable, MIPS, version 1\n./common.py:               a python script text executable .\n/data_old.gz:              gzip compressed data, from Unix\n./data.txt:                ASCII text\n./instrction.html:         HTML document text\n./molecule.msv:            data\n./output4.jpg:             JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01\n./outout4.png:             PNG image data, 640 x 480, 4-bit colormap\n./output4.xml:             XML document text\n./poster1.pdf:             PDF document, version 1.4\n./report.doc:              Microsoft Office Document\n```\n\n## Count rows and characters with `wc`\n\nCommand `wc` (Word Count) is a tool that can be used to count\ncharacters (`-m`), words (`-w`) or rows (`-l`) that a **Linux text file**\ncontains. The most common use of `wc` command is to quickly check\nthe row count of your file:\n\n```bash\nwc -l file_name\n```\n\nAnother common use is checking how many rows the output of a command\ncontains. For example, the following command would give the number of files\nwith extension `.dat` in the current directory.\n\n```bash\nls *.dat | wc -l\n```\n\n## Comparing two files with diff\n\nThe `diff` command can be used to compare two files. `diff` goes\nthrough the files row by row and prints out lines that are not\nidentical. `diff` is most useful when you need to compare two nearly\nidentical files like two versions of the same program file. The basic\nsyntax of the command is:\n\n```bash\ndiff file1 file2\n```\n\n## Using checksums to verify successful data storage or transfer\n\nChecksums provide a tool to make sure that a data file is fully\nconserved during storage or copying. The idea behind checksums is an\nalgorithm that calculates a number or a string based on the content of\nthe file. A checksum string is calculated and stored before the file is\nmoved to a storage media or copied to a new location. Later on, when the\ndata is retrieved from the storage or the copying process is finished, a\nnew checksum is computed based on the retrieved or copied files. If the\nnew checksum equals to the previously computed one, we can be pretty\nsure that the data is fully conserved.\n\nOne of the most common checksum algorithms is *md5* that is often used\nto verify the correctness of data files. For example, many scientific\ndata sets available on the internet are accompanied by a\nlist of md5 sums. The md5 sum is always a text string 32 characters\nlong. This string has the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
