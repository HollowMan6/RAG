The **Classless Inter-Domain Routing** or **CIDR** allows you to specify a subnet (`88.44.55.0/24`) or an specific IP (`88.44.55.77/32`).\n\n1. In order to find out your IP you can use services like <https://apps.csc.fi/myip>.\n\n!!! warning\n    Your network situation might more complicated than that. You may be behind a proxy. In that case, consult with your network support.\n\n!!! error\n    You can also open ports to all possible IP addresses by using `0.0.0.0/0` as CIDR, but doing this is a bad security practise.\n\n!!! Tip\n    **Please note:**\n\n    *   **Deleting the default egress rules (allow any protocol to 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0) in cPouta will cause disruption in the metadata service responsible for SSH key injections. If you want to limit egress traffic, you should at least allow outbound traffic to IP 169.254.169.254, TCP port 80, for SSH key injections to work.**\n    *   **Even though the ePouta virtual machines are only accessible via the customer's network, they also need to have security groups configured for them. Otherwise they can not be accessed.**\n    *   **It is possible to add and remove security groups on a running instance. This is done from the instances page.**\n\n### Server Groups\n\nIf you want a policy that allows your instances to run (or not) on the same host, you can set up server groups.\n\n![Server Groups](../../img/pouta-server-groups.png)\n\n!!! Warning  \n    You can only add an instance to a server group at instance creation time. Not afterwards!\n\nAfter clicking on **Create Server Group**, a windows will open:  \n\n![Create Server Group](../../img/pouta-create-server-group.png)\n\nGive a name to your server group and select a policy. You will have the choice between **Affinity**, **Anti Affinity**, **Soft Affinity** and **Soft Anti Affinity**.  \n\n- **Affinity**: Instances within a server group with an affinity policy are scheduled to run on the same host whenever possible. The affinity policy aims to keep instances together on the same physical server, which can be beneficial for applications or services that require low-latency communication between instances.\n\n- **Anti Affinity**: Instances within a server group with an anti-affinity policy are scheduled to run on different hosts whenever possible. The anti-affinity policy enhances fault tolerance and availability by spreading instances across multiple physical servers. This helps minimize the impact of hardware failures on a single server.\n\n- **Soft Affinity**: Soft affinity is a variation of the affinity policy. In a server group with a soft affinity policy, the scheduler attempts to keep instances on the same host, but it is not a strict requirement. If constraints prevent the co-location of instances on the same host, the scheduler can still place them on different hosts. Soft affinity provides a more flexible approach compared to the strict affinity policy.\n\n- **Soft Anti-Affinity:** Soft anti-affinity is a variation of the anti-affinity policy. In a server group with a soft anti-affinity policy, the scheduler attempts to place instances on different hosts, but it is not a strict requirement. If constraints prevent the spread of instances across different hosts, the scheduler can still place them on the same host. Soft anti-affinity provides a more flexible approach compared to the strict anti-affinity policy.  \n\nTo check if your instances are running on the same (or different) hosts, you can type this command:\n```sh\nopenstack server show [INSTANCE_NAME | INSTANCE_ID] | grep HostId\n```\n\n!!! Note  \n    The \"soft\" variants allow for more flexibility in instance placement.  \n    Affinity or anti-affinity policies may not always be possible due to resource constraints or other scheduling limitations.\n\n## Launching a virtual machine\n\nOnce the SSH keys and security groups are set, you can launch a new virtual machine using the Pouta web interfaces:\n\n!!! info\n    * [https://pouta.csc.fi](https://pouta.csc.fi) (for cPouta)\n    * or [https://epouta.csc.fi](https://epouta.csc.fi) (for ePouta)\n\n1. In the main page of the Pouta web interface, open the **Compute > Instances** view.\n1. Click in **Launch Instance** on the top right. This opens a _launch instance_ screen where you define the properties of the new virtual machine.\n\n    ![Launch the instance view](../../img/pouta-launch-instance.png 'Launch cPouta instance')\n\n    **Figure** Launch the instance view\n\n1. On the **Details** tab of the _launch instance_ view, first write the **Instance Name**.\n\n1. Select the **Flavour**, which is the \"size\" of the Virtual Machine that you will create. See [Virtual machine flavors and billing unit rates](../vm-flavors-and-billing) for a complete list and descriptions.\n\n1. In **Instance Count** you can specify the number of Virtual Machines to create. If in doubt, leave it to `1`.\n\n1. **Instance Boot Source**. Select \"Boot from image\" in the drop down menu.\n\n    !!! Info \"Cloud-native\"\n\n        In case you want to be more cloud-native, you can select the \"Boot from image (creates a new volume)\" option. This option creates a new persistent volume for your instance.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH refers to Secure Shell, a protocol used to securely access and manage a remote computer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIDR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Classless Inter-Domain Routing, a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cPouta is a cloud service platform that provides computing and storage resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ePouta is a cloud service platform designed for sensitive data and computing, ensuring high security and privacy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVER GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A server group in cloud computing is a collection of virtual servers that share a common set of policies or configurations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFFINITY<|>EVENT<|>Affinity in cloud computing refers to a policy where instances are scheduled to run on the same host whenever possible.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI AFFINITY<|>EVENT<|>Anti-affinity in cloud computing refers to a policy where instances are scheduled to run on different hosts whenever possible.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFT AFFINITY<|>EVENT<|>Soft affinity is a variation of the affinity policy that attempts to keep instances on the same host but is not a strict requirement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFT ANTI-AFFINITY<|>EVENT<|>Soft anti-affinity is a variation of the anti-affinity policy that attempts to place instances on different hosts but is not a strict requirement.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFFINITY<|>SERVER GROUP<|>Affinity policy is applied within a server group to keep instances together on the same host<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTI AFFINITY<|>SERVER GROUP<|>Anti-affinity policy is applied within a server group to spread instances across multiple hosts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFT AFFINITY<|>SERVER GROUP<|>Soft affinity policy is applied within a server group to attempt keeping instances on the same host<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFT ANTI-AFFINITY<|>SERVER GROUP<|>Soft anti-affinity policy is applied within a server group to attempt placing instances on different hosts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPOUTA<|>SSH<|>cPouta uses SSH for secure key injections and managing virtual machines<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPOUTA<|>SSH<|>ePouta uses SSH for secure key injections and managing virtual machines, focusing on sensitive data<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
