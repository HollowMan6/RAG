This environment will only be offered on LUMI-G.\n\n-   The name contains neither of those: The package is compiled with the system\n    gcc compiler, something that is only done for software that is\n    not performance-critical like some build tools and workflow tools.\n\nIn EasyBuild, `cpeGNU`, `cpeCray`, `cpeAOCC` and `cpeAMD` are called toolchains, a set of\ncompatible compilers, MPI and mathematical libraries. Software compiled with the\nsystem compiler is also called software compiled with the system toolchain,\nwhich is a restricted toolchain that only contains the compiler that comes with\nthe operating system. Software\ncompiled with different `cpe*` toolchains cannot be loaded at the same time but\ncan be loaded together with software compiled with the SYSTEM toolchain. The\nmodule system currently does not protect you against making such mistakes!\nHowever, software may fail to work properly.\n\n??? failure \"Issue: Missing programming environments\"\n    When we retire a programming environment from the system, the\n    corresponding `LUMI` module may remain available for a while with\n    some tricks under the hood so that software already compiled for that\n    version of the `LUMI` module would mostly still run. However,\n    no new compilations should be done with such a toolchain, and\n    we cannot guarantee that all software will still run (and know\n    for sure that some software will not run anymore due to the way\n    it is linked against libraries).\n\n## Adding additional software to the LUMI software stack\n\nThe `LUMI` software stack itself cannot offer all software to all users as that\nwould be both confusing (certainly as sometimes customizations are expected) and\nimpossible to maintain (as it would not be clear when software can be removed\nand no longer needs to be updated). Therefore, the `LUMI` software stack can be\nextended with software installed in the user's space through EasyBuild in a way\nthat is 100% compatible with the system stack. That software will be\nautomatically visible when loading the `LUMI` module.\n\nThe [LUMI Software Library][lumi-software-library] provides an overview of all\nsoftware that is either available pre-installed on the system or can be \nuser-installed via EasyBuild using recipes developed by LUST and partners in the\nLUMI project (and instructions for some software that is unsuitable for installation\nthrough EasyBuild).\n\nThe default location for user-installed software in `$HOME/EasyBuild`. However,\nwe advise installing software in the `/project` directory of the project\ninstead so that a single software installation can be used by all members of the\nproject. This is done by pointing the environment variable `EBU_USER_PREFIX` to\nthe software installation directory, e.g.,\n\n```bash\nexport EBU_USER_PREFIX=/project/project_465000000\n```\n\nIt is a good idea to do this in your `.profile` or `.bashrc` file. This will\nenable the `LUMI` modules to also find the software installed in that directory.\n\nLoading the `EasyBuild-user` module will enable installing software with\nEasyBuild for the current version of the `LUMI` software stack and current node\ntype (`partition` module).\n\nSee the [Easybuild][eb-in-docs] page for more information about installing\nsoftware using Easybuild.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
