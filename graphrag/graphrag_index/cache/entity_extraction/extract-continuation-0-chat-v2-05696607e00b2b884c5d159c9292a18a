Information about the sequencing study.\n\n- **Samples**. Information about the sequencing samples. You can also do a batch upload for samples.\n\n- **Experiments**. Information about the sequencing methods, protocols, and machines.\n\n- **Runs**. Samples, experiments, and files are linked through runs. Appropriate objects for FASTQ and BAM/CRAM submissions. You can also do a batch upload for runs.\n\n- **Analysis**. References the analysis (BAM) files. Associated with samples and study. Analysis should be only be used for BAM/BAI pair, VCF and phenotype linkage to samples. The analysis is an EGA specific metadata object that links Samples, to Files.\n\n- **Dataset**. Contains the collection of runs/analysis data files to be subject to controlled access. Associated with Policy, which is created by CSC helpdesk.\n\nAfter data release, each of these objects will be assigned with a permanent identifier or unique accession number.\n\n!!! note\n    \n    - **Data Access Committee (DAC)** and **Policy** need to be created by CSC helpdesk before they can be added to the metadata in the submitter portal. DAC is always associated with a Policy, and by selecting a Policy for a dataset in the metadata submitter portal, you also select the DAC linked to that specific Policy.\n    \n    - **Study**, **Samples**, and **Experiment** metadata can be registered before uploading files, while **Run** and **Analysis** objects cannot be registered before the files have been uploaded to Finnish FEGA. You can choose **Policy** for your submission only after you have registered all the other metadata, when you are registering **Dataset** metadata.\n    \n    - If you are performing *array-based submission(s)*, the submitter portal should only be used to register the Study, Samples, and Dataset metadata objects. In contrast, the other metadata objects need to be registered using an excel template.\n    \n## Step 8: Data release\nTo finalize your submission, write to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) to confirm that the submission can be released and add the following information from the submitter portal:\n\n- Name of the submission (as on the submitter portal)\n\n- Study Accession number (EGAS)\n\n- Dataset Accession number (EGAD)\n\n- Appropriate Data Use Ontology codes (DUO). You can find more information in Data Use Conditions on [EGA webpage](https://ega-archive.org/access/data-access-committee/data-use-ontology/). \n\nCSC helpdesk will complete the release process. You will receive confirmation of successful submission and accessions suitable for publication, grants, etc. from the CSC helpdesk.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EGA (European Genome-phenome Archive) is a platform for the submission, storage, and sharing of genetic and phenotypic data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC HELPDESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC Helpdesk assists with the creation of Policy and Data Access Committee (DAC) for data submission in the EGA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A committee required for data submission to EGA, associated with a specific Policy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of rules created by CSC Helpdesk that governs the access and use of datasets submitted to EGA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUDY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Information about the sequencing study registered in the EGA submitter portal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Information about the sequencing samples registered in the EGA submitter portal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERIMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Information about the sequencing methods, protocols, and machines registered in the EGA submitter portal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Links samples, experiments, and files through runs for FASTQ and BAM/CRAM submissions in the EGA submitter portal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANALYSIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>References the analysis files associated with samples and study in the EGA submitter portal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATASET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contains the collection of runs/analysis data files for controlled access in the EGA submitter portal)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC HELPDESK<|>POLICY<|>CSC Helpdesk is responsible for creating Policy for data submission<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC HELPDESK<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>CSC Helpdesk assists in creating DAC for data submission<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>POLICY<|>DAC is always associated with a specific Policy<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATASET<|>POLICY<|>Dataset metadata selection is associated with choosing a Policy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYSIS<|>SAMPLES<|>Analysis links Samples to Files in the EGA submitter portal<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYSIS<|>STUDY<|>Analysis is associated with a Study in the EGA submitter portal<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUNS<|>SAMPLES<|>Runs link Samples and Experiments in the EGA submitter portal<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUNS<|>EXPERIMENTS<|>Runs link Experiments and Files in the EGA submitter portal<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
