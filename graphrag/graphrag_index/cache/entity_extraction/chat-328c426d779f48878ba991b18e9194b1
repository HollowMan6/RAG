Hourly rate of BU consumption depends on the service, as described in\nmore detail in our [billing models](../../accounts/billing.md).\n\nYou can use the\n[billing unit calculator](https://research.csc.fi/billing-units#buc) to\nestimate your billing unit usage in different scenarios.\n\nSee how to\n[apply for more billing units](../../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md).\n\n## Batch job resource usage\n\nThe billing is calculated based on the resources that have been granted to your\nbatch job. For example, if you ask for 24 hours and 4 cores, but the job ends\nafter two hours, your project will be billed 2 x 4 core hours. Even if you ask\nfor 24 hours from the queuing system, you will not be billed 24 hours as the\nresources become available for other users when your job ends. However, note\nthat the billing is not based on actual CPU usage, so if your code is using\nonly little CPU, e.g. due to inefficient parallelization, all resources that\nhave been allocated to your job will still be billed for.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
