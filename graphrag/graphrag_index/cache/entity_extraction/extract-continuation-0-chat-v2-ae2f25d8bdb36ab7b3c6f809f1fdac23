They are available from FMI's own object storage which has more data than was stored to Puhti local disks. The easiest way to find PTA sentinel mosaics from FMI is with [Paituli STAC](https://paituli.csc.fi/stac.html). Paituli STAC page includes also usage examples for R and Python.\n\n## Spatial data in Allas\n\nCSC computing services users are welcome to share spatial data in [Allas](../Allas/index.md) with other users, if the data license terms allow this. This is a community service, meaning that any CSC user is welcome to contribute and add data to Allas. The data buckets in Allas are owned by data collaborators. If you would like some share some data you have in Allas, and would like the dataset be added to this page, contact CSC Servicedesk\n\nCurrently available:\n\n1.  **[Sentinel2 2A level images](https://a3s.fi/sentinel-readme/README.txt)**. Maria Yli-Heikkilä (LUKE) and Arttu Kivimäki (NLS/FGI) have downloaded Finnihs data from vegetation period (ca 10.5.-1.9.) in 2016->. The easiest way to find Sentinel data stored in Allas is with [Paituli STAC](https://paituli.csc.fi/stac.html). These files are public, so anybody can download them, also from own computer or other services.\n\nFor using data in Allas, see [CSC webinar about Allas and geospatial data](https://youtu.be/mnFXe2-dJ_g) and [Using geospatial files directly from cloud, inc Allas tutorial](../../support/tutorials/gis/gdal_cloud.md). \n\n## Puhti virtual rasters\n\nVirtaul rasters is a very practical concept for working with bigger raster datasets, see CSC [Virtual rasters](../../support/tutorials/gis/virtual-rasters.md) page for longer explanation and how to create own virtual rasters, inc from STAC search results.\n\n### NLS DEM and orthophotos ready-made virtual rasters\nCSC has added  to NLS 2m and 10m elevation models and infrared ortophotos in Puhti. There are two variants of virtual rasters for the elevation models: \n\n1.  The **direct** virtual rasters contain directly the source tif images without any hierarchical structure, overviews or pre-calculated statistics. The direct virtual raster is meant for using **only in scripts**. It should **not** be opened in QGIS, unless zoomed in and need to open only a few files etc:\n    *   2m DEM: `/appl/data/geo/mml/dem2m/dem2m_direct.vrt`\n    *   10m DEM: `/appl/data/geo/mml/dem10m/dem10m_direct.vrt`\n    *   infrared orthophotos: `/appl/data/geo/mml/orto/infrared_3067/infrared_euref_direct.vrt`\n\n2.  The **hierarchical** virtual raster is mainly for **viewing** purposes for example with QGIS. It has a hierarchical structure where a virtual raster for each folder contains all the data stored in that folder and it's subfolders. The hierarchical file structure also contains statistics (min, max, mean, stddev) and overviews for each vrt file, which enables a fairly responsive viewing of the entire DEM dataset for example in QGIS. This way the whole dataset can be easily viewed at different zoom levels. You may use the lowest level virtual raster (for example M41 in the 2m DEM) also in scripts, higher level virtual rasters may cause computational errors.\n\n    *   2m DEM: `/appl/data/geo/mml/dem2m/dem2m_hierarchical.vrt`\n\n### Puhti: create virtual rasters of DEM for custom area\n\nIn some cases it might be useful to create virtual rasters that cover only your study area or some part of it. CSC has made a Python script for creating virtual rasters for custom area from NLS 2m and 10m DEM datasets in Puhti. It's used in the following way:\n\n```\nmodule load geoconda\npython /appl/soft/geo/vrt/vrt_creator.py dataset polygon_file output_directory\n```\n\nSupported _dataset_ values are: dem2m, dem10m and demCombined. The last option prefers 2m DEM whenever it's available and interpolating rest of the areas to 2m resolution from 10m DEM using bicubic interpolation.\n\nOptional arguments:\n\n*   -i: create individual vrt for each polygon, default behavior is to create one vrt covering all polygons.\n*   -o: create overviews\n*   -p: output name prefix\n\n\n\n## License and acknowledgement\n\nIn general all datasets have an open license, but the exact terms vary a bit, mostly CC-BY-4.0 licenses are in use. Check the readme-files for further info.\n\nPlease acknowledge the data producer according to license terms as well as CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports. If you use data provided in Allas, please also acknowledge the person sharing the data.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Finnish Meteorological Institute, responsible for storing more data than was stored to Puhti local disks and can be accessed via Paituli STAC for PTA sentinel mosaics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC computing services, offers a platform for users to share spatial data in Allas and provides webinars and tutorials on using geospatial files from the cloud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A community service platform under CSC for sharing spatial data among users, where data buckets are owned by data collaborators)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENTINEL2 2A LEVEL IMAGES<|>EVENT<|>A collection of Finnish data from the vegetation period in 2016 onwards, available in Allas and downloadable by anyone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARIA YLI-HEIKKILÄ<|>PERSON<|>Associated with LUKE, involved in downloading Sentinel2 2A level images data for the vegetation period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTTU KIVIMÄKI<|>PERSON<|>Associated with NLS/FGI, involved in downloading Sentinel2 2A level images data for the vegetation period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contains virtual rasters and other geospatial data, part of CSC's computing resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NLS DEM<|>EVENT<|>National Land Survey's 2m and 10m elevation models and infrared orthophotos available in Puhti)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENTINEL2 2A LEVEL IMAGES<|>MARIA YLI-HEIKKILÄ<|>Maria Yli-Heikkilä contributed to the collection of Sentinel2 2A level images<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENTINEL2 2A LEVEL IMAGES<|>ARTTU KIVIMÄKI<|>Arttu Kivimäki contributed to the collection of Sentinel2 2A level images<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC<|>Allas is a community service platform provided by CSC for sharing spatial data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is part of CSC's computing resources offering virtual rasters and geospatial data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FMI<|>SENTINEL2 2A LEVEL IMAGES<|>FMI's object storage includes Sentinel2 2A level images accessible via Paituli STAC<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
