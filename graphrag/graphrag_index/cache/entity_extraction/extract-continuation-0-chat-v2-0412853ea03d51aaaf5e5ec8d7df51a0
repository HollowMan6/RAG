You do not have to always type the whole command-line\ncharacter by character. When you are typing the command, you can go\nbackwards and forward by using the *left and right arrow\nkeys*. You can delete the character left of the cursor with *Backspace*\nkey. Pressing `Ctrl-d` or the *Delete* key deletes the character under\nthe cursor. In addition to these basic command-line editing functions,\nyou can use the keyboard commands listed in the table below.\n\n| Command  | Function                                                     |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `Ctrl-a` | Move the cursor to the beginning of the command-line         |\n| `Ctrl-e` | Move the cursor to the end of the command-line               |\n| `Ctrl-k` | Cuts all the characters right of the cursor                  |\n| `Ctrl-y` | Paste the characters to the command-line (cut with `Ctrl-k`) |\n\nIn bash the executed commands are stored in user's home directory in a\nfile called `.bash_history`. To see the full list of recently executed\ncommands, give commandÂ `history`. On the command-line, you can browse\nthe list of previous commands with the *up and down arrow keys*. \nIn cases where you need to give similar commands several times, it is\noften handy to get one of the previous commands to the command-line with\nthe arrow key. Then you can edit just the modifications needed to the\nold command and execute the modified command by pressing `Enter`.\n\nIt's possible to search through the command history. Press `Ctrl-r`, then\ntype what you want to search for. You do not need to type a complete\nsearch as the search results will update with each character pressed.\nTo move between the search results, use the *up and down arrow keys*.\nTo run the command, press the *Return* key. If you\nwish to edit the search result before running the command, use the\n*left arrow key*, then edit the command.\n\n## Automatic Tab completion\n\nIf you press the *Tab* key, the bash shell tries to complete the command or\nargument you are writing. The completion is done as far as possible\nusing the list of available commands and files. Using auto-completion\nis very recommended as it saves the user from typing all command or\nargument characters and also takes care that commands don't get mistyped.\nFor example, let's say we are in a directory where we have two files:\n`final_research_report_old.pdf` and `final_research_report_new.pdf`.\n\n!!! info \"Tip\"\n    This will save you a lot of typing and typos!\n\nTo open the latter of the files with Evince program, we would need to\ntype the command:\n\n```bash\nevince final_research_report_new.pdf\n```\n\nThis command would require you to type 36 characters. However, by using\n*Tab completion* you need to type only 5 characters. First type\n\n```bash\nevi\n```\n\nand then press the *Tab* key. Normally at CSC, Evince is the only\navailable program or command that starts with letters *evi*, so when the\nTab completion is executed, it knows to complete the rest of the\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nevince\n```\n\nThen, to define the file name, you can type just the first letter of the\nfile name\n\n```bash\nevince f\n```\n\nWhen you now press *Tab*, the completion process checks which files\nstarting with *f* are available. In this case there are two of them and\nas the beginning of the two file names is the same string, the command\ncan now be completed to:\n\n```bash\nevince final_research_report_\n```\n\nNow you just need to type one *n* to the end of file name to distinguish\nthe file from the *old* version,\n\n```bash\nevince final_research_report_n\n```\n\nWhen the *Tab* key is now pressed again there is only one option that\nmatches the beginning of the argument that has been typed, and thus the\ncommand is completed and ready to be executed:\n\n```bash\nevince final_research_report_new.pdf\n```\n\n## Stopping programs and running programs in background\n\nIn Linux, graphical interfaces and commands that are not interactive\nonce they have started, can be executed as *background processes*. When\nthe command is executed as a background process, the command shell does\nnot wait until the command is finished. Instead, it remains active and\nallows the user to submit new commands while the background command gets\nexecuted. However, note that in the computing clusters of CSC, heavy\ncomputing tasks should not be executed as background processes, but they\nshould be submitted to the batch queue system.\n  \nIn normal interactive usage you can launch the command to be executed in\nthe background by adding `&` character to the end of the command. For\nexample, the command\n\n```bash\neog image1.jpg &\n```\n\nwould open the *Eye of GNOME* image viewing program (requires X-term\nconnection) to the background so that the command shell could\nstill be used even though the `eog` command is still running. A background\nprocess can be changed to normal, foreground process with command \n`fg`. When a command and program is running interactively, i.e. the\ncommand shell is waiting that the execution finishes, you can terminate\nthe execution by pressing `Ctrl-c`. Another possibility is to\nhalt the program by pressing `Ctrl-z`. When a command (or process) is\nhalted, it can be continued with `fg` command or changed to be executed\nas a background process with command `\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>bash is a Unix shell and command language written for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAB COMPLETION<|>EVENT<|>A feature in bash that tries to complete commands or arguments the user is writing using the list of available commands and files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVINCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Evince is a document viewer for PDF, PostScript, DjVu, TIFF, XPS, and DVI formats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EYE OF GNOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eye of GNOME is the default image viewing program in the GNOME desktop environment, often referred to by its executable name eog)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAB COMPLETION<|>BASH<|>Tab completion is a feature provided by bash to assist in completing commands and file names, reducing the need for full typing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVINCE<|>TAB COMPLETION<|>Evince is used as an example to demonstrate the utility of tab completion in bash for opening files<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EYE OF GNOME<|>BASH<|>Eye of GNOME can be run as a background process in bash, demonstrating bash's capability to manage background processes<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
