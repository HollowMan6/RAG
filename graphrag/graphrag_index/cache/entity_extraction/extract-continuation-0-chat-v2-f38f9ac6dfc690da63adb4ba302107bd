It\nwill perform a rolling update to kill all pods one by one and replace them with\nnewer ones while making sure that end user traffic is directed towards working\npods at all times.\n\n![Deployment](../img/deployment.png)\n\n### InitContainer\n\n_InitContainer_ is a container in a pod that is intended run to completion before\nthe main containers are started. Data from the init containers can be\ntransferred to the main container using e.g. empty volume mounts.\n\n*`pod-init.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: build-reader\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  name: build-reader\nrules:\n- apiGroups:\n  - build.openshift.io\n  resources:\n  - builds\n  verbs:\n  - get\n  - list\n  - watch\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: build-reader\nsubjects:\n  - kind: ServiceAccount\n    name: build-reader\nroleRef:\n  kind: Role\n  name: build-reader\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mypod\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n    pool: servepod\nspec:\n  volumes:\n  - name: sharevol\n    emptyDir: {}\n  initContainers:\n  - name: perlhelper\n    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n    image: quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:4.16\n    command:\n    - sh\n    - -c\n    - \"oc wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Complete build -l buildconfig=app --timeout=900s\"\n  containers:\n  - name: serve-cont\n    image: image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi/project/app\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: /var/www/html\n      name: sharevol\n```\n\nHere we run an init container that uses the `origin-cli` image and waits for the build in the `app` BuildConfig to end, once it ends the normal container can be launched, knowing that the image is already created.\n\nThe shared volume is defined in `spec.volumes` and \"mounted\" in\n`spec.initContainers[].volumeMounts` and `spec.containers[].volumeMounts`.\n\n### StatefulSet\n\nMost Kubernetes objects are stateless. This means that they may be deleted and recreated, and the application should be\nable to cope with that without any visible effect. For example, a Deployment defines a Pod with 5 replicas and a \nRolling release strategy. When a new image is deployed, Kubernetes will kill one by one all Pods, recreating them with \ndifferent names and possibly in different nodes, always keeping at least 5 replicas active. For some application this is\nnot acceptable, for this use case, Stateful sets have been created.\n\nLike a Deployment, a StatefulSet defines Pods based on container specification. But unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet \ngives an expected and stable identity, with a persistent identifier that it is maintained across any event \n(upgrades, re-deployments, ...). A stateful set provides:\n\n* Stable, unique network identifiers.\n* Stable, persistent storage.\n* Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.\n* Ordered, automated rolling updates.\n\n*`statefulSet.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n  name: web\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx # has to match .spec.template.metadata.labels\n  serviceName: \"nginx\"\n  replicas: 3 # If omitted, by default is 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx # has to match .spec.selector.matchLabels\n    spec:\n      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: openshift/hello-openshift\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 8888\n          name: web\n        volumeMounts:\n        - name: www\n          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\n  volumeClaimTemplates:\n  - metadata:\n      name: www\n    spec:\n      accessModes: [ \"ReadWriteOnce\" ]\n      storageClassName: \"standard-csi\"\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 1Gi\n```\n\n### Jobs\n\n\nA _Job_ uses  pods to execute a specific task one or several times, and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until\na specified number of them successfully terminate ot a backoff limit is reached. As pods successfully complete, the Job \ntracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is \ncomplete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job \nis resumed again.\n\n*`job.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: Job\nmetadata:\n  name: pi\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      volumes:\n      - name: smalldisk-vol\n        emptyDir: {}\n      containers:\n      - name: pi\n        image: perl\n        command:\n        - sh\n        - -c\n        - >\n          echo helloing so much here!
