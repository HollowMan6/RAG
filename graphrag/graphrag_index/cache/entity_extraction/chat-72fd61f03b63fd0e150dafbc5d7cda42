CSC\ndoes not have a general purpose installation of LAMMPS as each user typically\nneeds a more or less customized version. Please read below how to create yours.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: Instructions and CMake files available for building in\n  `/appl/soft/chem/lammps/`\n* Mahti: Instructions and CMake files available for building in\n  `/appl/soft/chem/lammps/`\n* LUMI: Instructions and CMake files available for building in\n  `/appl/local/csc/soft/chem/lammps`\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Don't use prebuilt binaries, but take a look at the instructions below for\n    configuring and compiling LAMMPS for optimal performance. Don't hesitate to\n    [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md) if you encounter any\n    problems!\n\n## License\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the GNU\nPublic License (GPL).\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Navigate to `/appl/soft/chem/lammps/` on Puhti/Mahti, or\n   `/appl/local/csc/soft/chem/lammps` on LUMI.\n2. If you can't find a pre-downloaded source code (e.g.\n   `stable_2Aug2023.tar.gz`) or the LAMMPS version is not suitable, download it\n   yourself from the [LAMMPS home page](https://lammps.org/download.html).\n3. Read the compilation instructions, e.g. `lammps-cpu-instruction.txt`.\n4. Select the packages you want to include and compile the software following\n   the instructions.\n5. Example input and batch scripts are available in the `example` directory.\n\n!!! info \"Compile using the fast local disk\"\n    Please compile in `$TMPDIR` on Puhti/Mahti for faster performance and\n    less load on the shared file system. As the local disk is cleaned\n    frequently, remember to move your files to your project's `/projappl`\n    directory afterwards. Setting `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/projappl/...` will\n    ensure that the files are moved automatically when running `make install`.\n    See the provided build instructions for specific details.\n\n!!! info \"GPU versions\"\n    To enable GPU support, we recommend building LAMMPS with the Kokkos\n    package. Kokkos is a portable programming model that allows running on both\n    Nvidia and AMD GPUs. It is typically also more efficient than the standard\n    GPU package.\n\n    When running, it is recommended to set the number of MPI tasks per node to\n    be equal to the number of physical GPUs on the node (GCDs on LUMI).\n    Assigning multiple MPI tasks to the same GPU is usually only faster if some\n    portions of the input script have not been ported to use Kokkos. See\n    [the LAMMPS documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/Speed_kokkos.html) for\n    more details.\n\nConsult these pages for generic instructions about running jobs:\n\n* [How to create batch jobs on Puhti](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md)\n* [How to create batch jobs on Mahti](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-mahti.md).\n* [How to create batch jobs on LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/batch-job/)\n\n### Performance notes\n\nThe following diagram compares the performance and scaling of LAMMPS on\nCPUs and GPUs on Mahti and LUMI. The system contains 16M atoms.\n\n![LAMMPS performance](../img/lammps-bench.png 'LAMMPS performance')\n\n* LAMMPS peformance is measured here in Gatom-steps/s, i.e. how many billion\n  atoms can be propagated one time step each second.\n* Large systems (millions of atoms) are able to utilize multiple GPUs\n  efficiently. The example system of 16M atoms scales well to several GPU nodes\n  and is about 10 times faster compared to running on an equal amount of CPU\n  nodes.\n* Smaller systems are best run on CPUs or a single GPU (or by sharing one GPU\n  among multiple independent trajectories using multi-replica simulations,\n  [see below](#high-throughput-computing-with-lammps)).\n\n### High-throughput computing with LAMMPS\n\nLAMMPS offers comprehensive support for executing loops and multiple\nindependent simulations using a single input file. The `-partition`\ncommand-line switch enables running these concurrently within a\nsingle Slurm job step, thus accelerating the computations while keeping the\nload on the batch queue system minimal as excessive calls of `srun` or `sbatch`\nare avoided. An example batch script using the `-partition` option is provided\nfor Puhti below.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --partition=large\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n#SBATCH --nodes=3\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=100\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load gcc/11.3.0 openmpi/4.1.4 fftw/3.3.10-mpi-omp\n\nexport PATH=\"/path/to/your/lammps/installation/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n\nsrun lmp -\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
