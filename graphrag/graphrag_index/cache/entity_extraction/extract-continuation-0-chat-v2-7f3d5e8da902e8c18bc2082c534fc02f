Nextflow provides built-in support for containers \nlike Singularity, which is a containerisation technology that is compliant \nwith HPC environment. Although Nextflow pipelines allow us to choose Docker \nengine as an executor for running pipelines, please note that Docker \ncontainers can't be used in Puhti due to the lack of administrative privileges for researchers.\n\n## Strengths of Nextflow\n\n* Easy installation\n* No database needed\n* Implicit parallelism supported\n* Can handle complex dependencies and conditional execution\n* Supports error recovery\n\n## Disadvantages of Nextflow\n\n* Limited MPI support\n* May create a lot of job steps and excess IO\n* Does not integrate well with Slurm\n\n## How Singularity works with Nextflow\nThe integration of Singularity containers with Nextflow follows the same \nexecution model as with Docker containers. So it does not require additional \nmodifications in a Nextflow script as such to be compatible with Singularity. \nOne has to just enable the use of Singularity engine (instead of Docker) \nin the Nextflow configuration file. Nextflow is able to pull remote container \nimages stored in Singularity or Docker-Hub registry. The remote container \nimages are usually specified in your Nextflow script or configuration \nfile by simply prefixing the image name with the `shub://` or `docker://`. \nIt is also possible to specify a different Singularity image for each \nprocess definition in the Nextflow pipeline script. \n\nHere is a generic recipe for running your Nextflow pipeline on Puhti :\n\n1. Prepare your singularity images on your local environment\n2. Login to Puhti supercomputer\n3. Load Nextflow as a module on Puhti\n4. Set-up your Nextflow pipeline environment\n5. Run your Nextflow pipeline as a batch job\n6. (Optional) tutorial - Demonstration of WtP Nextflow pipeline on Puhti\n\n## 1. Prepare your Singularity images on your local environment\n\nSingularity containers can't be built directly on Puhti. So one has to \nbuild and copy singularity container(s) of a nextflow pipeline from your \nlocal environment to Puhti supercomputer. \n\nHere are some options for preparing your singularity image:\n\n- Build a Singularity image on your local system  and then copy it to Puhti\n- Convert a Docker image to Singularity on your local system and then copy it to Puhti.\n- Copy a Singularity image from a container registry to Puhti.\n\nYou can also use [cPouta](../../cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui.md) environment at CSC to build singularity images.\n\n!!! note \n    Singularity is installed only on the compute nodes in Puhti and \n    it is not available for execution or testing on login nodes.\n\n## 2. Login to Puhti supercomputer\n\nSSH into the login node of Puhti cluster (See instructions [here](../../computing/index.md#connecting-to-the-supercomputers))\n\n```\nssh yourcscusername@puhti.csc.fi\n```\nWhere **yourcscusername** is the username you get from CSC.\n\n## 3. Load  Nextflow module on Puhti\n\nNextflow on Puhti is available as a module and can be load as below:\n\n```\nmodule load nextflow/21.10.6\n```\n\nIn case you need any custom installations with specific version of Nextflow in your \nworkspace, please follow instructions [here](../../computing/containers/tykky.md). \n\n## 4. Set-up your Nextflow pipeline environment\n\nRunning Nextflow pipelines can sometimes be quite compute-intensive and \nmay require downloading large volumes of data such as databases and \nsingularity images. This can take a while and may not even work successfully \nin case of downloading singularity images on Puhti. \n\nYou can do the following basic preparation before running your Nextflow pipeline:\n\n- Copy singularity images from your local workspace to your project folder on Puhti. \n  Pay attention to the singularity cache directory (i.e., `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or some \n  other name given by your software tool) which is usually `$HOME/.singularity/cache`. \n  The disk space of your home directory is quite limited (10 GB) on Puhti.\n- Move all your raw data to your project directory (`/scratch/<project name>`) on Puhti\n- Clone the GitHub repository of your pipeline to your scratch directory and then run your \n  pipeline. Alternatively, use the Nextflow pipeline directly \n  from DockerHub if the pipeline is available\n\n## 5. Run your Nextflow pipeline as a batch job\n\nPlease follow our instructions for writing a batch job on Puhti as described in \n[CSC documentation pages](../../computing/running/example-job-scripts-puhti.md).\n\nHere is a minimal script to get started with your Nextflow pipeline on Puhti:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00 # change your time settings\n#SBATCH --partition=test #  change partition as needed\n#SBATCH --account=project_XXX # add your project number here\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=xx # change as you need\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G   # increase as needed\n\nmodule load nextflow/21.10.6 \n\n# Actual Nextflow command here\nnextflow run  <workflow.nf> [options]\n```\n\n## 6.
