If, for example, you have specified `nchains=4`, `nruns=2` you should use 4 * 2 = 8 cores.\n\n## Batch jobs\n\nRunning MrBayes analysis might take considerable amount of CPU time and memory. It is, therefore, recommended running it through the batch job system on Puhti. Shorter test runs can be run in interactive mode using [sinteractive](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md). The serial version is recommended for interactive use.\n\nTo run a batch job you need to:\n\n1. Write a MrBayes command file (here `mb_com.nex`) or include a MrBayes command block in your `.nex` file. For details, see [Chapter 5.5.1 of the MrBayes manual](https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/develop/doc/manual/Manual_MrBayes_v3.2.pdf).\n2. Write a batch job script (here `mb_batch`)\n3. Make sure you have all your input files (here `primates.nex`)\n4. Submit your job into the queue\n\nMrBayes command file should include the commands you would type in MrBayes in interactive mode. This example \nruns the analysis mentioned in [Chapter 2 of the MrBayes 3.2 manual](https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/develop/doc/manual/Manual_MrBayes_v3.2.pdf).\n\n```text\nbegin mrbayes;\n    set autoclose=yes nowarn=yes;\n    execute primates.nex;\n    lset nst=6 rates=invgamma;\n    mcmc nchains=4 nruns=2 ngen=20000 samplefreq=100 printfreq=100 diagnfreq=1000;\n    sump;\n    sumt;\nend;\n```\n\nBelow is an example batch job script for Puhti using 8 cores. We are using 8 cores since our example uses `nchains=4`, `nruns=2`, so 4 * 2 = 8.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --job-name=my_mrbjob\n#SBATCH --error=my_mrbjob_err%j\n#SBATCH --output=my_mrbjob_out%j\n#SBATCH --ntasks=8\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4000\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nsrun mb-mpi mb_com.nex >log.txt\n```\n\nTo submit the job on Puhti:\n\n```bash\nsbatch mb_batch \n```\n\n## More information\n\n* [MrBayes home page](https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/index.html)\n* [Manual and other resources](https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/manual.html)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
