Batch queue system and interactive use\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 2\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/batch_jobs/parallel.html\n---\n\n# Batch job tutorial - Parallel jobs\n\n> In this tutorial we'll get familiar with the basic usage of the Slurm batch queue system at CSC\n- The goal is to learn how to request resources that **match** the needs of a job\n\nüí¨ A batch job consists of two parts: resource requests and the job step(s)\n\n‚òùüèª Examples are done on Puhti. If using the web interface, open a login node shell.\n\n## Parallel jobs\n\nüí¨ A parallel program is capable of utilizing several cores and other resources simultaneously for the same job\n\nüí¨ The aim of a parallel program is to solve a problem (job) faster and to tackle larger problems that would be intractable to run on a single core\n\nüí° There are two major approaches to dividing a computational burden over several cores:\n\n- [OpenMP](https://e-learn.csc.fi/pluginfile.php/3007/mod_resource/content/1/09-OpenMP-intro.pdf)\n- [MPI](https://e-learn.csc.fi/pluginfile.php/2997/mod_resource/content/1/04-intro-to-mpi.pdf)\n- Depending on the parallel program and the type of job, the optimal resource request is often difficult to predict beforehand\n    - Always start small and scale up gradually! Don't run on 1000 cores unless you're sure your program can use each of them efficiently.\n\n‚òùüèª Note! You need to have an MPI module loaded when running parallel batch jobs. If you get an error saying `error while loading shared libraries: libmpi.so.40: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`, try `module load StdEnv` to load the default environment (or load a specific MPI module, e.g. `openmpi`).\n\n### A simple OpenMP job\n\nüí¨ An OpenMP-enabled program can take advantage of multiple cores that share the same memory on a **single node**, a.k.a. _threads_\n\n1. Go to your personal folder under the `/scratch` directory of your project:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/<project>/$USER         # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n- Now your input (and output) will be on a shared disk that is accessible to the compute nodes.\n\nüí° You can list your projects with `csc-projects`\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Download a simple program parallelized with OpenMP:\n\n```bash\nwget https://a3s.fi/hello_omp.x/hello_omp.x\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Make it executable using the command:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x hello_omp.x\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Copy the following script into a file called `my_parallel_omp.bash` and change `<project>` to the CSC project you actually want to use:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>      # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n#SBATCH --time=00:00:10          # Maximum duration of the job. Upper limit depends on partition. \n#SBATCH --partition=test         # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, hugemem_longrun\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1               # Number of tasks. Upper limit depends on partition.\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4        # How many processors work on one task. Max: Number of CPUs per node.\n\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\nsrun hello_omp.x\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Submit the job to the queue with the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch my_parallel_omp.bash\n```\n\nüí¨ In the batch job example above we are requesting\n\n- resources for one OpenMP job (`--ntasks=1`)\n- using four cores (threads) per task (`--cpus-per-task=4`)\n- for ten seconds (`--time=00:00:10`)\n- from the test queue (`--partition=test`)\n\nüí¨ We want to run the program `hello_omp.x` that will be able to utilize four cores\n\nüí≠ Exporting the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` will tell the program that it can use four threads\n\nüóØ Each of the four threads launched by `hello_omp.x` will print their own output\n\n#### Check the output\n\nüí¨ When finished, the output file `slurm-<jobid>.out` should contain the results printed from each of the four OpenMP threads\n\n1. Check which files exist in the folder:\n\n```bash\nls\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Check the output with:\n\n```bash\ncat slurm-<jobid>.out     # replace <jobid> with the actual Slurm job ID\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. The results should look something like this:\n\n```bash\ncat slurm-5118404.out\nHello from thread: 0\nHello from thread: 3\nHello from thread: 2\nHello from thread: 1\n```\n\n### A simple MPI job\n\nüí¨ An MPI-enabled program can take advantage of resources that are spread over multiple compute nodes\n\n1.
