If not done\nalready, start by [installing the OpenStack tools](install-client.md).\n\nYou can do most of the things you need in the OpenStack (Horizon)\nweb interface of cPouta and ePouta. However, sometimes it is handier,\nor even necessary, to use command line tools. OpenStack is divided into\nsubcomponents that each take care of specific tasks such as managing\nvirtual machines, volumes or images. Each of these subcomponents has\nits own API which can be accessed either programmatically or in a\nterminal using the command line tools that are introduced in this\nchapter.\n\nThe command line tools are used to control your use of the service, so\nthey should be installed either on your local laptop/desktop or\nanother server which you will use to manage the service.\n\n# Using Pouta from the command line\n\nThis article lists some basic commands for some of the most common\noperations in OpenStack. For each of the operations, we show a command\nthat uses the common OpenStack command line tool.\n\n##### These recommended versions of the OpenStack commands should work with the current version of ePouta and cPouta (Train).\n\n- [python-openstackclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-openstackclient/)==4.0.2\n- [python-cinderclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-cinderclient/)==5.0.2\n- [python-glanceclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-glanceclient/)==2.17.1\n- [python-heatclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-heatclient/)==1.18.1\n- [python-keystoneclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-keystoneclient/)==3.21.0\n- [python-neutronclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-neutronclient/)==6.14.1\n- [python-novaclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-novaclient/)==15.1.1\n- [python-swiftclient](https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-swiftclient/)==3.8.1\n\nMore information: [OpenStackClient pip module](https://pypi.org/project/python-openstackclient/)  \n\n!!! info\n\n    You can install the latest versions of the OpenStackClient pip module since they are backwards compatible.\n\n##### Openstack commands and help\n\n    openstack -h\n\nYou can get a list of the available OpenStack subcommands by appending \"-h\"\nafter the `openstack` command. If you wish to see the options for a specific\nsubcommand, add the command name after \"help\". For example:\n\n    openstack help server create\n\n##### Adding a keypair\n\n    openstack keypair create --public-key <file> <name>\n\n**The first thing you should do** is to\ngenerate a keypair. It will be used to access virtual machines. You\ncan also optionally specify a public key you have previously generated,\nin which case the private key is the one you generated when the\npublic key was generated.\n\nGenerate a key named \"test\" with a private key stored in \"test.pem\":\n\n    openstack keypair create test > test.pem\n\n##### List available images\n\n    openstack image list\n\nThis command lists the images that are available for the user. This\nincludes public images and images that the user has added.\n\n##### List the available flavors\n\n    openstack flavor list\n\nThe flavor of a virtual machine defines its virtual hardware: how many\ncores, how much memory, and so on.\n\n##### Launch a virtual machine\n\n    openstack server create --flavor <flavor> --image <image id> --key-name <key name> <name for machine>\n\nThis command has the minimum amount of information for launching a\nfunctioning virtual machine.\n\n!!! info\n\n    The output of the command \"openstack server create\" shows also a \n    password called adminPass. You do not need to store this password as\n    is not used when connecting to the virtual machine. The virtual \n    machine allows access to a user only if the user uses SSH keys.\n\n##### Customize the virtual machine before launch\n\n    openstack server create --flavor <flavor> --image <image id> --key-name <key name> --user-data user-data.sh <name for machine>\n\nThe `user-data.sh` file can have extra commands to be executed automatically after the instance has been launched.\n\nBelow is an example content of the script file that would add a custom user in to the flavor and giving it the `sudo` rights:\n\n``` bash\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Add a new user called boss\nuseradd -m boss\n\n# Add the user to sudoers. No password is needed for sudo.\necho 'boss ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' > /etc/sudoers.d/boss\n```\n\nThe script file can contain any arbitrary command, so some cautioness is recommended.\n\n!!! Note\n    Please note that the example does not contain addition of user authentication (public SSH key).\n\n##### List instances\n\n    openstack server list\n\nThis will give a list of the user's instances and information related\nto them.\n\n##### Terminate instances\n\n    openstack server delete <server>\n\nThis command shuts down and removes the machine. The running virtual\nmachine is removed and cannot be recovered.\n\n##### Associate public address\n\n    openstack floating ip create public\n\nA public address must first be allocated from a pool of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
