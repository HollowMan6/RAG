Properties\nboth for ground and excited states can be obtained. TURBOMOLE has been designed\nfor efficient study of large systems. \n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 7.5.1, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8\n- Mahti: 7.5.1, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8\n\n## License\n\n- You may use the Software exclusively for non-profit research\n  purposes.\n- Only users from academic (i.e. degree-granting) institutes are\n  allowed to use the Software\n\n## Usage\n\nInitialise TURBOMOLE environment:\n\n```bash\nmodule load turbomole/7.8\n```\n\n### Batch script example for Puhti using MPI parallelization\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40 # MPI tasks per node\n#SBATCH --account=<project>  # insert here the project to be billed \n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00           # time as `hh:mm:ss`\nexport PARA_ARCH=MPI         # use MPI \nmodule load turbomole/7.8\nexport SLURM_CPU_BIND=none\n# This setting of TURBOTMPDIR assumes that the job is \n# submitted from a directory below /scratch/<project>\nexport TURBOTMPDIR=`echo $PWD |cut -d'/' -f1-3`\"/TM_TMPDIR/\"$SLURM_JOB_ID\nmkdir -p $TURBOTMPDIR\nexport PARNODES=$SLURM_NTASKS  # for MPI\nexport PATH=$TURBODIR/bin/`$TURBODIR/scripts/sysname`:$PATH\njobex -ri -c 300 > jobex.out\n```\n\n### Batch script example for Puhti using SMP parallelization\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --nodes=1            # for SMP only 1 is possible\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40   # SMP threads\n#SBATCH --account=<project>  # insert here the project to be billed\n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00      # time as `hh:mm:ss`\nexport PARA_ARCH=SMP         # use SMP threads   \nmodule load turbomole/7.8\n# This setting of TURBOTMPDIR assumes that the job is \n# submitted from a directory below /scratch/<project>\nexport TURBOTMPDIR=`echo $PWD |cut -d'/' -f1-3`\"/TM_TMPDIR/\"$SLURM_JOB_ID\nmkdir -p $TURBOTMPDIR\nexport PARNODES=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK  # for SMP\nexport PATH=$TURBODIR/bin/`$TURBODIR/scripts/sysname`:$PATH\njobex -ri -c 300 > jobex.out\n```\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Occasionally `mpshift` calculations are terminated due to the local `/tmp`\n    becoming full. The problem can be circumvented by redefining `$TMPDIR`:\n    ```bash\n    export TMPDIR=$TURBOTMPDIR\n    ```\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Particularly some of the wavefunction-based electron correlation methods\n    can be very disk I/O intensive. Such jobs benefit from using the fast local\n    storage on Puhti. Using local disk for such jobs will also reduce the load\n    on the Lustre parallel file system.\n \n### Batch script example for Puhti using MPI parallelization and local disk\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40 # MPI tasks per node\n#SBATCH --account=<project>  # insert here the project to be billed\n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00      # time as `hh:mm:ss`\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:100      # requested local disk in GB\nexport PARA_ARCH=MPI         # use MPI\nmodule load turbomole/7.8\nexport SLURM_CPU_BIND=none\n# define local disk as scratch\nexport TURBOTMPDIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH/$SLURM_JOBID\nmkdir -p $TURBOTMPDIR\nexport PARNODES=$SLURM_NTASKS  # for MPI\nexport PATH=$TURBODIR/bin/`$TURBODIR/scripts/sysname`:$PATH\ndscf > dscf.out\nccsdf12 > ccsdt.out\n```\n\n### Batch script example for Mahti using MPI parallelization\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=medium\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128 # MPI tasks per node\n#SBATCH --account=<project>   # insert here the project to be billed\n#SBATCH --time=00:60:00       # time as `hh:mm:ss`\nexport PARA_ARCH=MPI          # use MPI\nmodule load turbomole/7.8\nexport SLURM_CPU_BIND=none\n# This setting of TURBOTMPDIR assumes that the job is \n# submitted from a directory below /scratch/<project>\nexport TURBOTMPDIR=`echo $PWD |cut -d'/' -f1-3`\"/TM_TMPDIR/\"$SLURM_JOB\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
