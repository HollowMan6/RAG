You\ncan use either command line application or a special terminal\nprogram. Command line applications come standard on most operating\nsystems. Terminal programs may need to be installed separately, but they\ntypically offer more options on things like font size, copy-paste etc.\n\nOn Linux or macOS open a terminal. In Windows 10 open Powershell. Give command:\n\n```text\nssh yourcscusername@puhti.csc.fi\n```\nWhere **yourcscusername** is the username you get from CSC.\n\nYou can find more detailed instructions in our User Guide: [Connecting\nto CSC supercomputers](../../computing/connecting/index.md).\n\n\n## What is Puhti?\n\nPuhti, like most modern HPC (High Performance Computing) systems, is\na cluster computer. It means that is has a small number of login nodes\nand a large number of compute nodes.\n\nWhen you log in, you end up in one of the two login nodes. Login nodes\nare meant for things like moving data and setting up and managing your\nbatch jobs. You should not run actual jobs on the login nodes. There\nare only two login nodes and they are shared by everybody. Running big\njobs on them can make the system slow and unresponsive for all\n(More details in our [usage policy](../../../computing/usage-policy)).\n\nJobs should be run in the compute nodes. This is done using the *batch\njob system* also called a *scheduler* or a *workload manager*. The\nsystem in use in Puhti is called [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html).\n\nTo run your job through the batch job system you use command **srun**\nor write a batch jobs script and use command **sbatch**. We will\ndiscuss this in more detail later.\n\nTo check what kind of compute nodes are available in Puhti, see the\nUser Guide: [Technical details about\nPuhti](../../computing/systems-puhti.md).\n\n\n## Software environment\n\nPuhti has a selection of commonly used bioscience software\navailable. You can check the listing in\n[Applications](../../apps/by_discipline.md#biosciences).\n\nThe application listing may not be quite up to date, so it is a good\nidea to use **module spider** command to see if a software (and which\nversion) is available, *e.g*:\n\n```text\nmodule spider bowtie2\n```\n\nTo avoid conflicts between different applications and versions, most\nsoftware on Puhti is installed as *modules*. To use an application you\nwill need to load the module, *e.g*:\n\n```text\nmodule load bowtie2\n```\nYou can also specify a specific version, *e.g*:\n```text\nmodule load bowtie2/2.3.5.1\n```\nIf you do not specify a version, the default version (typically latest\nstable release) is loaded.\n\nWe also provide a module that loads many commonly used bioscience \napplications at once:\n```text\nmodule load biokit\n```\nThe easiest way to see the content of the biokit module is to load it, and check the listing.\n```text\nmodule list\n```\n\nTo see which modules to load, see the instruction page for each software\n\nFor more information on the module system, please see the user guide:\n[The module system](../../computing/modules.md).\n\n\n## Planning your job\n\nTo run a job through a batch job system, you will need to reserve\nresources, *i.e.* cores, memory and time, suitable for the job. To\ndecide on the needed resources, you will have to answer some\nquestions:\n\n### How many cores can my application use?\n\nFirst a short note on terminology: When speaking about home computers\npeople usually use terms \"processor\" and \"core\". For example, most\nmodern home computers have one processor with two or more cores. When\nspeaking about HPC machines the corresponding terms are \"socket\" and\n\"CPU\". For example, Puhti compute nodes have two sockets with 20 CPUs\neach. This tutorial uses terms \"processors/cores\", as they are\nprobably more familiar for people without HPC background.\n\nApplications can be divided into categories according to the amount \nof cores they can use:\n\n- **Serial applications**\n    - Can only use one core\n    - Many bioscience applications belong to this category\n    - If the application manual makes no mention of number of cores or \n      threads to use, the application is probably serial\n    - Reserving more cores will not make these applications any faster, \n      as they can only use one\n- **Shared memory/threaded/OpenMP applications**\n    - Can use more than one core, but all cores must be in the same node \n      (so in Puhti max 40 cores)\n    - Most bioscience applications that can use more than one core are \n      in this category\n    - Also remember to tell the application the number of cores to use\n    - Check the application documentation for correct command line options\n    - Usually it is best to match the number of cores to the number of threads, \n      but check the application documentation \n- **MPI parallel applications**\n    - Can use more than one core, cores need not be in the same node\n    - Only very few bioscience applications in this category\n- **Hybrid parallel applications**\n    - A job where each MPI task is allocated several cores. Each task then \n      uses some other parallelization than MPI to do work. The most common strategy \n      is for every MPI task to launch multiple threads using OpenMP.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
