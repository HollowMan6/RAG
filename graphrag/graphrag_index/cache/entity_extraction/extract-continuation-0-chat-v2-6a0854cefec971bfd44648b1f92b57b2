If the software you\nloaded has dependencies, they will be loaded in your environment at the same\ntime.\n\nTo load a specific version of the module, you need to specify it after the name\nof the module:\n\n```bash\n$ module load cray-fftw/3.3.10.5\n```\n\nTo unload a module from your environment, use the `unload` sub-command\nfollowed by the name of the module you want to remove.\n\n```\n$ module unload cray-fftw\n```\n\nIn most cases multiple `module load` or `module unload` commands can be combined\nin a single `module load` or `module unload` command. One exception to this is\nany sequence of loads or unloads involving the `cpe` module from the Cray\nProgramming Environment as loading or unloading of this module only takes full\neffect at the next `module` command.\n\nYou can also remove all loaded modules from your environment by using the\n`purge` sub-command.\n\n```bash\n$ module purge\n```\n\nIn Lmod, some modules can be declared as sticky modules by the sysadmins. These\nmodules will not be removed by `module purge` and will produce an error message\nwhen you try to unload them with `module unload`. On LUMI, this is the case for\nthe modules that activate a software stack so that it is possible to unload all\nmodules that are loaded in the stack without deactivating the stack. Sticky\nmodules can still be unloaded or purged by adding the `--force` option, e.g.,\n\n```bash\n$ module --force unload LUMI\n$ module --force purge\n```\n\nNote the position of the `--force` argument.\n\nIt is also possible to see the Lmod commands that are executed when loading a\nmodule using `module show`. E.g.,\n\n```bash\n$ module load CrayEnv\n$ module show cray-fftw\n```\n\nwill show\n\n```text\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   /opt/cray/pe/lmod/modulefiles/cpu/x86-rome/1.0/cray-fftw/3.3.10.5.lua:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhelp([[Release info:  /opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/release_info]])\nhelp([[Documentation: `man intro_fftw3`]])\nwhatis(\"FFTW 3.3.10.5 - Fastest Fourier Transform in the West\")\nsetenv(\"FFTW_VERSION\",\"3.3.10.5\")\nsetenv(\"CRAY_FFTW_VERSION\",\"3.3.10.5\")\nsetenv(\"CRAY_FFTW_PREFIX\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5\")\nsetenv(\"FFTW_ROOT\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/x86_rome\")\nsetenv(\"FFTW_DIR\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/x86_rome/lib\")\nsetenv(\"FFTW_INC\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/x86_rome/include\")\nsetenv(\"PE_FFTW_PKGCONFIG_VARIABLES\",\"PE_FFTW_OMP_REQUIRES_@openmp@\")\nsetenv(\"PE_FFTW_OMP_REQUIRES\",\" \")\nsetenv(\"PE_FFTW_OMP_REQUIRES_openmp\",\"_mp\")\nsetenv(\"PE_FFTW_PKGCONFIG_LIBS\",\"fftw3f_mpi:libfftw3f_threads:fftw3f:fftw3_mpi:libfftw3_threads:fftw3\")\nprepend_path(\"PKG_CONFIG_PATH\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/x86_rome/lib/pkgconfig\")\nprepend_path(\"PATH\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/x86_rome/bin\")\nprepend_path(\"MANPATH\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/share/man\")\nprepend_path(\"CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH\",\"/opt/cray/pe/fftw/3.3.10.5/x86_rome/lib\")\nprepend_path(\"PE_PKGCONFIG_PRODUCTS\",\"PE_FFTW\")\n```\n\nThe interesting lines are the `setenv` lines which tell which environment\nvariables will be set and the `prepend_path` lines which tell which directories\nwill be added to certain PATH-style variables.\n\n## Saving your environment\n\nSometimes, if you frequently use multiple modules together, it might be useful\nto save your environment as a module collection. However, you should do so only\nif you fully understand how Lmod works and what is saved as saving environments\nis rather fragile in Lmod. E.g., in the LUMI software stack, saving a\ncollection on the login nodes may not give you the right binaries when working\non one of the types of compute nodes, even though the application modules have\nthe same name and version. Also, when saving a collection of modules, the full\npathname to each of the module files is saved so *the stored collection will\nbreak if modules have to be moved*. Following a system maintenance interval, \nthe stored module configuration is often also broken.\n\nA collection can be created using `save` sub-command.\n\n```bash\n$ module save <collection-name>\n```\n\nYour saved collections can be listed using the `savelist` sub-command.\n\n```bash\n$ module savelist\n```\n\nOf course, the main interest of a collection is that you can load all the\nmodules it contains in one command. This is done using the `restore`\nsub-command.\n\n```bash\n$ module restore <collection-name>\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CRAY-FFTW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cray-FFTW is a software module for performing the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West, version 3.3.10.5, provided by Cray on the Lmod module system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer that uses the Lmod module system for managing software environments, including sticky modules that activate a software stack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Lmod<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lmod is a Lua-based module system that allows users to easily set up their software environment using module load and unload commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FFTW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FFTW stands for Fastest Fourier Transform in the West, a software library for computing discrete Fourier transforms, version 3.3.10.5 is specifically mentioned)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAY-FFTW<|>Lmod<|>Cray-FFTW is a module that is managed within the Lmod system, indicating a dependency or usage relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>Lmod<|>LUMI uses the Lmod system for managing software modules, indicating a usage or dependency relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FFTW<|>CRAY-FFTW<|>FFTW is the software library that the Cray-FFTW module provides, indicating a direct relationship between the software and its module<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
