Data on Lustre is accessible from all nodes of a system, and is thus\nthe best place to store the data that you need for computations. Please note\nthat you can not directly access data on Puhti from Mahti or vice versa, i.e.\nthey have their own Lustre file systems. You can, however, move data between\nPuhti and Mahti using tools such as [rsync](../../data/moving/rsync.md).\n\nMore specifically, CSC supercomputers have three main disk areas: *home*,\n*projappl* and *scratch*. The home directory (accessible using the `$HOME`\nenvironment variable) is the only user-specific directory. The other\ndirectories scratch and projappl are project-based and shared by all members of\na project. You can access them at `/scratch/<project>` and\n`/projappl/<project>`, respectively, where `<project>` should be replaced by\nthe actual ID of your CSC project (see\n[How to find information about my projects](./how-to-find-information-about-projects.md)).\nThis also means that if you are a member of several projects, you also have\naccess to multiple scratch and projappl directories. You will, however,\nonly have one home directory.\n\nWhen logging in to CSC supercomputers, you should change to your project's\nscratch directory because the home directory is not intended for storing data\nthat is required for analysis or computing. Its purpose is to store\nconfiguration files and other **minor** user-specific data (default quota 10\nGB). A directory exceeding its capacity causes various problems (see\n[Disk quota exceeded](disk-quota-exceeded.md)). The scratch disk is the main\ndisk area to store your active research data (default quota 1 TB), while \nprojappl is intended, for example, for project-wide installations of custom\nsoftware and libraries (default quota 50 GB). See\n[more information about the disk areas](../../computing/disk.md).\n\n!!! note \"CSC does not back up your data!\"\n    None of the disk areas are automatically backed up by CSC. This means that\n    data accidentally deleted by the user cannot be recovered in any way. Also\n    keep in mind that files on the scratch disk that have not been used in 180\n    days will be automatically deleted.\n    \n    To avoid unintended data loss, please move files that are not in active use\n    away from scratch and remember to take regular backups of your important\n    data to, for example, Allas or your own organization's storage systems.\n\nOne of the main use cases of [Allas](../../data/Allas/index.md) is to store\ndata that is not in active on the CSC supercomputers. Before working on the\ndata on an HPC system, copy it from Allas to the supercomputer (*stage in*).\nWhen the data is no longer actively used it can be *staged out*, i.e. uploaded\nback to Allas.\n\nRead more about\n[common use cases of Allas](../../data/Allas/using_allas/common_use_cases.md)\nand see the\n[example of hosting a dataset](../../data/Allas/allas_project_example.md).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC operates supercomputers Puhti and Mahti, providing computational resources and storage solutions)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC supercomputer that uses a Lustre file system for data storage)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC supercomputer that uses a separate Lustre file system for data storage, distinct from Puhti)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A parallel file system used by CSC supercomputers for data storage, accessible from all nodes of a system)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage system intended for data not in active use on CSC supercomputers)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is operated by CSC and provides computational resources<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC<|>Mahti is operated by CSC and provides computational resources<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti uses the Lustre file system for data storage<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE<|>MAHTI<|>Mahti uses a separate Lustre file system for data storage<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC<|>Allas is recommended by CSC for storing data not in active use on their supercomputers<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
