This is also the case for most other programs\nso if you wish to use LUMI-O with other software, you usually have to find some configuration option or environment variable to set a non-default\nhost name. The correct hostname to use for LUMI-O is `https://lumidata.eu`\n\nLUMI-O is an S3 compatible storage solution. However, this does not mean\nthat the system is the same as the \"Amazon S3 Cloud Storage\". The interface for reading and writing data \nis exactly the same, but AWS has a bunch of additional features, like _self-service provisioning of IAM users_,\n_life cycle configuration_ and _write once, read many functionality_, which are not really part of \"just\" s3 storage. \n\nIt's worth keeping the above in mind, as many people use S3 and Amazon S3 interchangeably\nwhen writing guides or instructions.  \n\n!!! warning \n\tSome advanced  operations which are supported by AWS will complete successfully when run against\n\tLUMI-O, e.g object locks, but will actually have no effect. Unless it is explicitly stated that a feature\n\tis provided by LUMI-O, assume that it will not work and be extra thorough in verifying correct functionality. \n\n## Credentials & Configuration\n\n### Moving tool configuration files\n\nIn some cases it might be required to read\ncredentials from some other location than the default \nlocations under home. This can be achieved using environment variables or command line flags.\n\n\n|      | rclone        | s3cmd                  | aws                                         |\n|------|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| DEFAULT | `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`   | `~/.s3cfg`  | `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`|\n| ENV  | `RCLONE_CONFIG` | `S3CMD_CONFIG`           | `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` |\n| FLAG | `--config FILE` | `-c FILE`, `--config=FILE` |                                             |\n\nThe `aws` cli additionally has the concept of [profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html), and you can specify \nwhich one to use using the `--profile <name>` flag or the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.\n\n### Environment\n\nMost programs will use the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\nwhen trying to authenticate. So these can be set if one does not wish to save the credentials on disk.\nThe environment variables do not always take precedence over values set in configuration files, as\nis the case for `s3cmd` and `rclone`. This means that invalid credentials in config files will\nlead to an access denied even if there are valid credentials in the environment. The `aws` command\nwill use the environment variables instead of `~/.aws/credentials` if they are set. \n`rclone` will additionally require `RCLONE_S3_ENV_AUTH=true` in the environment or `env_auth = true`\nin the config file.\n\n\n## Programmatic access \n\nWhen use cases become sufficiently complex one might want to interact\nwith LUMI-O in a more programmatic fashion instead of using the \ncommand line tools. One such option is the AWS SDK for Python [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/)\\*.\n\nThe script\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\nsession = boto3.session.Session(profile_name='lumi-465000001')\ns3_client = session.client('s3')\nbuckets=s3_client.list_buckets()\n```\n\nWould fetch the buckets of project 465000001 and return the information as a python dictionary. \nFor the full list of available functions, see the [aws s3 client documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html)\n\n\nIf a default profile has been configured `~/.aws/credentials`\nthe client creation can be shortened to:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n```\n\nboto3 uses the same configuration files and respects the same environment variables as the `aws` cli.\n\n!!! note \n\tYou will need a sufficiently new version of boto3 (e.g version 1.26, which is installed if using python3.6, is too old) for it\n\tto understand a default profile set in ~/.aws/credentials and corresponding config file, \n\totherwise the tool will always default to aws s3 endpoint and you will need to specify the\n\tprofile/endpoint when constructing the client.\n\n\\*_If you prefer to work with some other language there are also options for e.g Java, GO and Javascript_\n\n## Granular Access management\n\nUsing the rclone config generated by `lumio-conf` or using `s3cmd put -P` you can easily\nmake objects and buckets public or private. This section\nexplains how to apply more granular rules than a fully private/public content to e.g:\n\n- Share data with another lumi project.\n- Restrict object access to specific IP:s\n- Allow external modification to only specific objects. \n\nProjects in LUMI-O are handled as \"single user tenants/accounts\", where the project numerical id (e.g. 465000001) corresponds both the tenant/account name and the project name.\n\nSubsequently, **all members of a LUMI-O project have\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-O<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI-O is an S3 compatible storage solution distinct from Amazon S3 Cloud Storage, offering similar interfaces for data storage but lacking some AWS-specific features like self-service provisioning of IAM users, life cycle configuration, and write once, read many functionality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON AWS S3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon AWS S3 is a cloud storage service offering a wide range of features including self-service provisioning of IAM users, life cycle configuration, and write once, read many functionality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.
