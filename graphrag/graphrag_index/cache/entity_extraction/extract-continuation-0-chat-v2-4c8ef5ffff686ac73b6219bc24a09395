The metadata of a file are controlled by\nMetadata Servers (MDSs) and stored on Metadata Targets\n(MDTs). Basically, the servers handle the requests for accessing the\nfile contents and metadata; the applications do not access disks\ndirectly. Lustre systems use typically multiple OSSs/MDSs together\nwith multiple OSTs/MDTs to provide parallel I/O capabilities.\n\n* *Object Storage Servers* (OSSs): They handle requests from the clients\n  in order to access the storage. Moreover, they manage a set of OSTs;\n  each OSS can have more than one OST to improve the I/O parallelism.\n* *Object Storage Targets* (OSTs): Usually, an OST consists of a block of\n  storage devices under RAID configuration. The data is stored in one or more\n  objects, and each object is stored on a separate OST.\n* *Metadata Server* (MDS): A server that tracks the locations for all the\n  data so it can decide which OSS and OST will be used. For example, once a\n  file is opened, the MDS is not involved any more.\n* *Metadata Target* (MDT): The storage contains information about\n  the files and directories such as file sizes, permissions, access\n  dates. For each file MDT includes information about the layout of\n  data in the OSTs such as the OST numbers and object identifiers.\n\n![\"Schematic picture of compute nodes accessing OSTs and MDTs via OSS and DST servers via network. The acronyms and relations are explained also in the text.\"](../img/lustre.png 'Lustre file system view')\n\n*Lustre file system view*\n\nLustre is designed for efficient parallel I/O for large\nfiles. However, when dealing with small files and intensive metadata\noperations, the MDS/MDT can become a bottleneck. For example, when a\nuser opens/closes a file many times in a loop, the workload on\nMDT increases. When several users do similar operations, the metadata\noperations can slow down the whole system and influence many users. As login\nand compute nodes share the file system, this can show up even as slow\nediting of files in a login node. Also, if in a parallel application\nthe different processes perform a lot of operations on the same small\nfiles, metadata operations can slow down. Innocent looking Linux\ncommands can also increase metadata workload: for example `ls -l`\nprints out file metadata, and giving the command in a directory with\nlots of files causes many requests to MDS.\n\n## File striping and alignment\n\nIn order to gain from parallel I/O with Lustre, the data should be\ndistributed across many OSTs. The distribution across many OSTs is\ncalled **file striping**. Logically, a file is a linear sequence of\nbytes. In file striping, the file is split in chunks\nof bytes that are located on different OSTs, so that the read/write\noperations can be performed concurrently.\n\nStriping can increase the bandwidth available for accessing files,\nhowever, there is also an overhead due to increase in network\noperations and possible server contention. Thus, striping is normally\nbeneficial only for large files.\n\nAs the supercomputers have many more nodes than OSSs/OSTs, the I/O\nperformance can vary a lot depending on the I/O workload of the whole\nsupercomputer.\n\nIn a parallel program, performance is improved when each parallel process\naccesses a different stripe of a file during parallel I/O. Moreover, in order\nto avoid network contention each process should access as few OSTs/OSSs as\npossible. This can be achieved through stripe alignment. Best\nperformance is obtained when the data is distributed uniformly to\nOSTs, and the parallel processes access the file at offsets that\ncorrespond to stripe boundaries.\n\n![\"Schematic showing a file split into chunks and each stored in a different OST.\"](../img/file_striping.png 'Lustre file striping and alignment')\n\n*Lustre file striping and alignment*\n\nIf in the above example, we had a file of 5 MB, then the OST 0 would\nhave an extra 1 MB of data. If the data would be distributed evenly\nbetween four processes, each process would have 1.5 MB and the access\nwould not be stripe aligned: first process needs to access OST 0 and\n1, next process OST 1 and 2, *etc.* processes are not aligned. This\ncould now cause network contention issues.\n\n### Controlling striping\n\nThe default stripe size in CSC's Lustre is 1 MB and stripe count is 1,\ni.e. by default the files are not striped. Stripe settings can be,\nhowever, changed by user which can at best improve the I/O performance\na lot.\n\nThe stripe settings for a file or directory can be queried with the\n`lfs getstripe` command\n\n```\nlfs getstripe my_file\n```\nwhich prints out:\n```\nmy_file\nlmm_stripe_count:  2\nlmm_stripe_size:   1048576\nl\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lustre is a parallel distributed file system used by CSC supercomputers for efficient parallel I/O operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supercomputers that utilize the Lustre file system for handling large-scale data processing and storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE SERVERS (OSSS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Servers that handle requests from clients to access storage and manage Object Storage Targets (OSTs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE TARGETS (OSTS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Storage devices under RAID configuration that store the actual data in Lustre file system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METADATA SERVER (MDS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A server in Lustre file system that tracks locations for all the data and decides which OSS and OST will be used)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METADATA TARGET (MDT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Storage that contains information about files and directories, such as sizes, permissions, and access dates in Lustre file system)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE SERVERS (OSSS)<|>OBJECT STORAGE TARGETS (OSTS)<|>OSSs manage a set of OSTs to improve I/O parallelism in Lustre file system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>METADATA SERVER (MDS)<|>METADATA TARGET (MDT)<|>MDS controls the metadata of files stored on MDTs in Lustre file system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>CSC supercomputers use Lustre as their parallel distributed file system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE<|>OBJECT STORAGE SERVERS (OSSS)<|>Lustre's architecture includes OSSs for handling storage requests<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE<|>METADATA SERVER (MDS)<|>Lustre's architecture includes MDS for managing metadata operations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
