In other words, the permit is not from Findata, and **the permit is issued for SD Desktop**.\n\nProcessing data issued directly from a single register differs from processing data issued by Findata. If you have received a permit directly from a single register, you need to use **SD Apply** to access the data on SD Desktop. The following instructions will direct you on how to apply for access to data issued by a single register.\n\n!!! Note\n    * [SD Connect](sd_connect.md), a service used for storing sensitive research data, is **not accessible for registry data processing**. It is not possible to directly import any additional data, script, or software into the virtual desktop. \n    * If you need software that is not available on the SD Desktop by default, please contact [Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (*Subject: Sensitive Data, Secondary use*) well in advance - even before applying for a data permit.\n\n*Please note that you can create a test project and test regular SD Desktop independently, to make sure that SD Desktop is suitable for your needs. [Instructions how to access regular SD Desktop](sd-use-case-new-user-project-manager.md).*\n\n## Get access to single register data\n\n### Create a project in MyCSC\n\n* First you need to create a project in MyCSC and CSC will activate SD Desktop for it.\n* [Follow steps 1 - 8 from Findata instructions](findata-permit.md#get-access-to-sd-desktop-for-secondary-use). Return here after step 8.\n___\n\n### Apply access for the dataset with SD Apply\n\nAfter creating the project in MyCSC, you need to apply for access to the dataset in SD Apply. This is a technical security step and does not affect the permission granted in the data permit. Plese note that all project members need to be added to the application in order for them to be able to access the data on SD Desktop.\n\n#### 1. Login to SD Apply\nLog in to SD Apply at [https://sd-apply.csc.fi/](https://sd-apply.csc.fi/). Logging in to SD Apply is possible either with user identity federation systems (Haka or Virtu login) or with a CSC account.\n\n!!! Note\n    Always use the same identity provider when you log in to SD Apply, because all your actions are connected to your login identity.\n\n#### 2. Apply for access\nAfter login, you will access the SD Apply \"Catalogue\" page. On this page, you can search for a specific dataset and start the application process. Start a new application by clicking *Add to cart* next to the name of the dataset. By clicking *Apply*, you will be redirected to the application form.\n\n[![SD Apply \"Catalogue\" page](images/apply/apply_catalogue.png)](images/apply/apply_catalogue.png)\n\nYou can find the correct dataset from the *Registry Datasets* catalogue list with the identification information provided by the data controller. Usually, the name of the dataset corresponds with the identifier of the organisation (same as their email domain) combined with the journal number of your data permit. The datasets are grouped in the catalogue by organisation.\n\n#### 3. Submit the application\nFollow the instructions on the application form and fill in the required fields:\n\n * **State**. Contains basic details like title and state of your application.\n * **Applicants**. Everyone who has been granted access in the data permit must be named in the Applicants field. Members can be added, changed, or removed without re-applying. You can invite other people to join the data access application by selecting *Invite members* and providing their names and email addresses. They will then get an invitation via email. By following the invitation link, they can log in to SD Apply and accept the terms of use. When the application is approved, all members of the application will be granted access to the same dataset.\n * **Resources**. Shows the datasets you are applying for.\n * **Terms of use**. Lists all of the licenses defining the terms and conditions for data access. To access, click on *Accept terms of use.*\n * **Application**. Access to a secondary use dataset is granted only based on the data permit. Provide the possible verification information requested by the data controller here.\n\nTo submit your application, select *Send application* under Actions. Editing or deleting the application is no longer possible after sending the application. However, removing members is still possible.\n\n[![SD Apply application form](images/apply/apply_application.png)](images/apply/apply_application.png)\n\n!!! Note \"\"\n    #### 4. Wait for approval from data controller\n    * After you have sent the application, it will be forwarded to the data controller, who approves or rejects it. \n    * You will receive an email notification whenever the state of your application changes.\n\nDuring the approval process, the data controller can:\n\n* Approve or reject your application\n* Close your application and cancel the application process.\n\nYou can follow the approval process and read the possible comments from the *Events* section of the application. In addition, you can find all your applications and see their state from the *Applications* tab:\n\n* **Draft**. Your application is still a draft and cannot be seen by the data controller. You can continue working on your application or delete it entirely from the system.\n* **Submitted**. The application has been sent to the data controller\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Desktop is a virtual desktop environment for accessing and processing sensitive social and health data for secondary use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINDATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Findata is an organization that issues permits for the secondary use of social and health data but is not involved in this specific permit process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD APPLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Apply is a technical security step for accessing datasets on SD Desktop, requiring users to apply for access to data issued by a single register)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Connect is a service for storing sensitive research data, which is not accessible for registry data processing in this context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service Desk is a support service for users needing software not available by default on SD Desktop)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MyCSC is a platform where users can create projects and CSC will activate SD Desktop for those projects)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>SD APPLY<|>SD Apply is used to access data on SD Desktop for projects with permits from a single public register<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>SD CONNECT<|>SD Connect cannot be used for importing data into SD Desktop for registry data processing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>SERVICE DESK<|>Service Desk provides support for software needs on SD Desktop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>MYCSC<|>MyCSC is used to create projects for which CSC will activate SD Desktop<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
