Depending on tool selection and settings,\neither the whole host file system or a limited subset is visible during execution\nand installation. This means that it's possible to wrap installations using e.g\n`mpi4py` relying on the host-provided MPI installation.\n\nThis documentation covers a subset of the functionality and focuses on Conda and\nPython. Most advanced use-cases are not covered here yet.\n\n!!! Warning\n    As Tykky is still under development, some of the more advanced features might\n    change with respect to exact usage and API.\n\n## Tykky module\n\nTo access Tykky tools:\n\n1) Usually it is best to first unload all other modules:\n\n```bash\nmodule purge\n```\n\n2) Load the Tykky module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load tykky\n```\n\n## Conda-based installation\n\nFirst, make sure that you have read and understood the license terms for Miniconda\nand any used channels before using the command.\n\n- [Miniconda end-user license agreement](https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en?name=offering-specific-terms#miniconda).\n- [Anaconda terms of service](https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en/?name=terms-of-service#terms-of-service).\n- [A blog entry on Anaconda commercial edition](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/anaconda-commercial-edition-faq).\n\n1) Create a **Conda environment file** `env.yml`:\n\n- [Create manually a new file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually) or\n- [Create the file from an existing Conda installation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment). For example: `conda env export -n <target_env_name> > env.yml`.\n  \t- If the existing environment is on a Windows or MacOS machine, the [`--from-history` flag](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#exporting-an-environment-file-across-platforms) might be required to get a `.yml` file suitable for Linux.\n  \t- If the existing environment is on a Linux machine with x86 CPU architecture, it is also possible to use [`--explicit` flag](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments).\n\nAn example of a suitable `env.yml` file would be:\n\n```yaml\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.8.8\n  - scipy\n  - nglview\n```\n\n!!! info\n    The `channels` field lists which channels the packages should be pulled from\n    to this environment, whereas the `dependencies` field lists the actual Conda\n    packages that will be installed into the environment. Note that Conda uses a\n    channel priority for determining where to install packages from, i.e. it tries\n    to first install packages from the first listed channel. If no package versions\n    are specified, Conda always installs the latest versions.\n\n2) Create a new directory `<install_dir>` for the installation. `/projappl/<your_project>/...`\n   is recommended.\n\n3) Create the installation:\n\n```bash\nconda-containerize new --prefix <install_dir> env.yml\n```\n\n4) Add the `<install_dir>/bin` directory to your `$PATH`:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"<install_dir>/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\n5) Now you can call `python` and any other executables Conda has installed in the same\n   way as if you had activated the environment.\n\n### Using Jupyter with a Tykky installation\n\nTo use a Tykky installation with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), include correct conda package in your Conda environment file: `jupyterlab` for [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or `notebook` for [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from `conda-forge` channel. Also additional JupyterLab extensions can be installed, for example [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) or [dask-labextension](https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension). \n\nThe best way to use Jupyter in Puhti or Mahti is with [the web interface](../webinterface/index.md). See [Jupyter application page](../webinterface/jupyter.md#tykky-installations) for details how to use your own Tykky installation with Puhti web interface Jupyter.\n\n### Pip with Conda\n\nTo install some additional pip packages, add the `-r <req_file>` argument, e.g.:\n\n```bash\nconda-containerize new -r req\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
