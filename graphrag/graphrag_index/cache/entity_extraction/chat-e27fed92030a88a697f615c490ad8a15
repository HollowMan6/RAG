Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

For example, `Submitted batch job 3609650`.\n\nTo check if your job is running correctly:\n\n```bash\nsqueue -u $USER\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nsqueue --me\n```\n\nYou should see your job ID and other details displayed in the terminal.\n\nTo cancel a submitted batch job:\n\n```bash\nscancel <jobid>\n```\n\nFor example,\n\n```bash\nscancel 3609650\n```\n\nTo find out more about your jobs:\n\n```bash\nsacct\n```\n\nThe information includes the state of the jobs (`PENDING`, `RUNNING`,\n`COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, etc.) and the job ID.

In particular, avoid running the\n    command many times in a row. Instead, you can redirect the output data to a\n    file and then search that for whatever information you want to analyze.\n    For example, to save the data from the past 7 days in a file\n    `sacct-output.txt`:\n\n    ```bash\n    sacct --starttime now-7days > sacct-output.txt\n    ```\n\n## More information\n\n- [Creating Puhti batch jobs](creating-job-scripts-puhti.md)\n- [Creating Mahti batch jobs](creating-job-scripts-mahti.md)\n- [Available batch job partitions](batch-job-partitions.md)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
