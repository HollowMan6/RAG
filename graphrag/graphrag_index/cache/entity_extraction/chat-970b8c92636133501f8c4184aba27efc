You can find more information in the [CSC computing environment articles].\n\nUsers can create virtual machines with larger or\nsmaller compute resources based on their needs. The virtual\nmachine *flavors* available in cPouta and ePouta are listed below in\nseparate tables.\nPlease note that the values for the memory of each flavor (in GiB) are approximated.\n\n\n## About redundancy\n\nIn addition to the amount of cores, memory, and disk, the flavors we offer vary also on the level of redundancy of the nodes hosting the virtual machines.\nThe details on the levels of redundancy follow.\n\n### Power redundancy\n\nFor the power provisioning of the node hosting the virtual machine, there are two possible values of redundancy.\n\n* ![Icon for power redundancy level NONE](../../img/circle_icons/p0.svg) **NONE** - The node is not protected from sudden power losses. **A fault in the power provisioning of the node might make the virtual machine temporarily unreachable**.\n* ![Icon for power redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/p100.svg) **FULL** - The node is protected from sudden power losses (UPS).\n\n### Data redundancy\n\nWithin each virtual machine, the customer data is stored in a root disk (R) and possibly in an [ephemeral disk (E)](ephemeral-storage.md).\nFor customer data, there are three possible values of redundancy.  \nWe also offer the possibility to store the data in a [persistent volume (FULL)](persistent-volumes.md)\n\n* ![Icon for root disk data redundancy level NONE](../../img/circle_icons/r0.svg)![Icon for ephemeral disk data redundancy level NONE](../../img/circle_icons/e0.svg) **NONE** - The disk is stored only in the node running the virtual machine and it is not backed up (RAID-0 or LVM striping). **A fault in one of the disks of the node might corrupt the data of the virtual machine**. Moreover, **a fault in the node hosting the virtual machine might make the virtual machine not usable until the fault is fixed**.\n* ![Icon for root disk data redundancy level BASIC](../../img/circle_icons/r50.svg)![Icon for ephemeral disk data redundancy level BASIC](../../img/circle_icons/e50.svg) **BASIC** - The disk is stored only in the node running the virtual machine and it is mirrored within the same node (RAID-1). A fault in a single disk of the node does not compromise the data of the virtual machine. **Simultaneous faults in multiple disks of the node might corrupt the data of the virtual machine**. Moreover, **a fault in the node hosting the virtual machine might make the virtual machine not usable until the fault is fixed**.\n* ![Icon for root disk data redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/r100.svg)![Icon for ephemeral disk data redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/e100.svg) **FULL** - The disk is stored using multiple nodes in a fault-tolerant fashion (Ceph), so the customer data is not tied to any specific node. In case of a fault in a node used by the customer, it is possible to re-spawn the virtual machine of the customer using an alternative node.\n\n### Network redundancy\n\nFor the network reachability of the virtual machine, there are two possible values of redundancy.\n\n* ![Icon for network reachability redundancy level NONE](../../img/circle_icons/n0.svg) **NONE** - The node hosting the virtual machine is connected to the cloud platform without a failover link. **A fault in the link of the node might make the virtual machine temporarily unreachable**.\n* ![Icon for network reachability redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/n100.svg) **FULL** - The node hosting the virtual machine is connected to the cloud platform with an additional failover link.\n\n## cPouta flavors\n\nThe following tables list the available virtual machine flavors in cPouta and their\nbilling unit coefficients.\nNote that the default cPouta user account\nallows users to launch only a subset of the available virtual machine\nflavors.\n\n### Standard flavors\n\n|Flavor|Cores|Memory<br/>(GiB)|Root<br/>disk<br/>(GB)|Ephemeral<br/>disk<br/>(GB)|Total<br/>disk<br/>(GB)|Memory/<br/>core<br/>(GiB)|Redundancy|Billing<br/>Units<br/>/h|\n|--- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|standard.tiny   |1|0.9 |80 |0 |80 |0.9  |![Icon for power redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/p100.svg)![Icon for root disk data redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/r100.svg)![Icon for network reachability redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/n100.svg)|0.25 |\n|standard.small  |2|1.9  |80 |0 |80 |0.9  |![Icon for power redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/p100.svg)![Icon for root disk data redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/r100.svg)![Icon for network reachability redundancy level FULL](../../img/circle_icons/n100.svg)|0.5  |\n|standard.medium |3|3.9 |80 |0 |80 |1.3|![\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
