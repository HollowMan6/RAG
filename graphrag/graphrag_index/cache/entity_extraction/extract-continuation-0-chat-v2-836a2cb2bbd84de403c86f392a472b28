This is called Source to Image or `s2i`. It is used by running `oc new-app URL#branch`, the `#branch` is optional. For example, use the official python sample code:\n\n```bash\n$ oc new-app https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-python.git\n--> Found image 4e4d991 (2 weeks old) in image stream \"openshift/python\" under tag \"3.8\" for \"python\"\n\n    Python 3.8 \n    ---------- \n    Python 3.8 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Python 3.8 applications and frameworks. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n\n    Tags: builder, python, python38, python-38, rh-python38\n\n    * The source repository appears to match: python\n    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-python.git will be created\n      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag \"os-sample-python:latest\"\n      * Use 'start-build' to trigger a new build\n    * This image will be deployed in deployment config \"os-sample-python\"\n    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service \"os-sample-python\"\n      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname \"os-sample-python\"\n\n--> Creating resources ...\n    imagestream.image.openshift.io \"os-sample-python\" created\n    buildconfig.build.openshift.io \"os-sample-python\" created\n    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io \"os-sample-python\" created\n    service \"os-sample-python\" created\n--> Success\n    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/os-sample-python' to track its progress.\n    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:\n     'oc expose svc/os-sample-python' \n    Run 'oc status' to view your app.\n```\n\nThe image will be found in Rahti 1 registry. Then do as suggested and expose the new application to the outside world:\n\n```bash\n$ oc expose svc/os-sample-python\nroute.route.openshift.io/os-sample-python exposed\n```\n\nIn order to get the new route hostname do:\n\n```bash\noc get route os-sample-python\n```\n\nIf you enter the hostname in a browser, you will see the \"Hello World!\" message.\n\nA new build can be triggered in the command line:\n\n```bash\noc start-build os-sample-python\n```\n\nOr using [webhooks](../../tutorials/webhooks.md)\n\n### Using the `Docker` strategy\n\nThis is used in the same way as the Source to Image mechanism, `oc new-app URL#branch`. Rahti 1 will then detect that there is a Dockerfile in the repository and build the image automatically. This is useful when we want to fine tune a build procedure, or when the base image is not know to Rahti. The example bellow uses `node:16` as a base, but Rahti 1 does not support node16 by default.\n\n```sh\n$ oc new-app https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-express-app.git\n--> Found container image 0787341 (13 days old) from registry.access.redhat.com for \"registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-16-minimal:1\"\n\n    Node.js 16 Minimal \n    ------------------ \n    Node.js 16 available as container is a base platform for running various Node.js 16 applications and frameworks.
