It utilizes a library\nof Apptainer-based software containers, pre-loaded by CSC. You can suggest a container to be added to the library.\n\nAuto-apptainer is not available by default, but you must install it first using [SD Software installer](./sd-software-installer.md).\nAfter that you can launch the tool with command:\n\n```text\nauto-apptainer\n```\n\nBy default, this lists all the Apptainer packages available for auto-apptainer. From the list you can select the package to be installed.\n\nAlternatively you can add a filtering criteria to the command. In this case only those containers whose name or one \nof commands that the container provides, matches the search criteria, are listed.\n\nFor example command:\n\n```test\nauto-apptainer bam\n```\n\nasks the user to choose from two containers: _bamtools_ and _bedtools_. Bedtools is included as it provides commands `bamToBed` and `bamToFasta` that match the search criteria in this case.\n\nOnce a container is selected, one or more Apptainer wrapper-based commands are created to drectory: `/shared-directory/sd-tools/bin`.\nThese commands can mostly be used like natively installed commands. For example after installing the Bamtools container, \nBamtools can be started with command:\n\n```text\nbamtools\n```\n\nBelow you can find a list of software that can be installed with auto-apptainer. The list can be outdated. You can get an up-to-date\nlist by running command `auto-apptainer` in SD Desktop.\n\n*  bamtools_2.5.2--hd03093a_1\n*  bcftools_1.20\n*  bedtools_2.31.0\n*  bwa_0.7.17\n*  deepvariant_1.5.0\n*  finnish-nertag\n*  hisat2_2.2.1--h87f3376_5\n*  python3-for-medimaging\n*  regenie_3.0.1\n*  samtools_1.17-2023-06\n*  seqtk_v1.3-1-deb_cv1\n*  stringtie_2.2.0--ha025227_1\n*  taguette\n*  vcftools_v0.1.16-1\n*  vsearch_2.23.0--h6a68c12_0\n*  weeder_2.0--h9f5acd7_7\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUTO-APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Auto-apptainer is a tool for adding software to SD Desktop virtual machines, utilizing Apptainer-based software containers pre-loaded by CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC pre-loads Apptainer-based software containers for use with Auto-apptainer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Desktop is a virtual machine environment that can utilize Auto-apptainer for software installation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAMTOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bamtools is a software package available for installation via Auto-apptainer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEDTOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bedtools is a software package that includes commands like bamToBed and bamToFasta, available for installation via Auto-apptainer)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTO-APPTAINER<|>CSC<|>CSC pre-loads software containers for Auto-apptainer<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTO-APPTAINER<|>SD DESKTOP<|>Auto-apptainer is used to add software to SD Desktop virtual machines<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAMTOOLS<|>AUTO-APPTAINER<|>Bamtools is a software package that can be installed using Auto-apptainer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEDTOOLS<|>AUTO-APPTAINER<|>Bedtools is a software package that can be installed using Auto-apptainer<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
