[Docs CSC page about installing own software](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/installing/)\n- If you don't know how or run into problems while trying, contact <servicedesk@csc.fi>\n  - For LUMI-related queries, [contact the LUMI User Support Team](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/)\n\n# Code categories\n\n- Start by reading the software documentation\n  - The installation method depends on code type (or category)\n  - Instructions found online rarely work as \"copy/paste\" in an HPC environment\n- Before doing a lot of work, check if an alternative software is already available in the [CSC application list](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)\n  - Also check with `module spider`\n\n# Binaries\n\n- If you have ready-made binaries, you can simply try to run them\n- The problem with ready-made binaries is that they are hardly ever optimal for the computer they are used on\n  - Especially MPI codes should always be re-compiled for best performance\n- Ready binaries can be considered if\n  - The source code is not available\n  - The software is compiled on an identical computer\n  - The software is for relatively light (serial or threaded) computation\n\n# Interpreted languages\n\n- Examples of high-level interpreted languages are\n  -  Python, Java, Perl, R, etc.\n- These languages do not _need_ to be compiled, but they often can be\n- Running these programs usually requires loading a suitable module for the language\n  - Loading modules ensures also that the software will run the same on the compute nodes\n\n# High-performance computing languages\n\n- Programming languages that need to be compiled\n   - Typical examples are _e.g._ C, C++ and Fortran\n- Most resource-intensive software have been programmed using these\n- As a researcher, you typically _only_ need to compile a software (unless available pre-installed)\n  - Can sometimes be complicated\n  - If you run into problems, contact <servicedesk@csc.fi>\n\n# About compilers and profiling\n\n- A compiler is a special program that reads, analyses and translates a human-readable source code into a machine-readable object code\n- It performs 4 steps: Lexical analysis, syntactic and semantic analysis, optimization and output code generation\n- Compilers target specific operating systems and computer architectures and\n  are usually programming language-specific\n- **Code profiling**: Analysis of an application (memory, CPU, network utilized) to understand its performance\n  - Checking how much time is spent in different software routines is important to identify performance bottlenecks (don't optimize before this!)\n\n# Some general notes\n\n- No `sudo` available for users on the CSC supercomputers\n  - You can't use package managers (`apt`, `yum`, etc.)\n  - You can't install into \"standard\" locations (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, etc.)\n    - Set the installation directory to `/projappl` or similar\n- Start by loading a suitable compiler suite or language module\n  - Many commonly used [HPC libraries](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/hpc-libraries/) (e.g. OpenMPI, ScaLAPACK, FFTW) are available as modules (search with `module spider`)\n- Compile on the fast local disk (`$TMPDIR`) to avoid stressing Lustre\n- New software is not automatically added to `$PATH`\n  - Include the full path or add with `export PATH=\"/path/to/my/sw:$PATH\"`\n\n# Installation methods: Native installations\n\n- Installing directly to the system\n- Usually the preferred way for software with few or no dependencies\n\n# Installation methods: Containers\n\n- [Containerization](09_singularity.html) is an efficient method to install software and their dependencies\n  - Very easy if a ready-made container is available\n- Recommended particularly for software with complex dependencies\n\n# Installation methods: Conda\n\n- Conda is a common installation system, but it is very problematic on HPC systems\n  - Creates a huge number of files and leads to poor performance on the Lustre parallel file system\n  - Installations easily break when the system changes\n- Containerization is required if you intend to use Conda environments on CSC supercomputers (see [usage policy](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/#conda-installations))\n  - Wrapping Conda installations into a container alleviates problems since the number of files is dramatically decreased from the FS point of view\n  - CSC has created [a tool called Tykky](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/) which does the containerization automatically and transparently\n\n# Testing -- it's important to test _first_\n\n- Construct a [batch job script](05_batch_jobs.html) for a short and simple test run\n  -
