In that case, you can search\nfor a specific file using the command `a-find`. In this example, we can check\nif an object contains the file `Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa`:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ a-find -a Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n----------------------------------------------\nChecking bucket: 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH\nObject: 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish.tar \nincludes 2 file names that that match query: Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\nObject: 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\nincludes 1 file names that that match query: Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n------------------------------------------------ \nQuery: Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\nTotal of 3 hits were found in 2 objects\n-------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nThe `a-find` report above tells, for example, that the object\n`2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish.tar` contains two files whose names\nmatch `Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa` (the other file is `Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa.fai`).\nNote that `a-find` finds matches only among objects that were uploaded with\n`a-put`.\n\nNext, we download the data to Puhti using the `a-get` command:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ a-get 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish.tar\nStarting to copy data from allas...\nObject:\n  2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish.tar\ncopied and uncompressed from allas into:\n  zebrafish\n```\n\nAfter this, the current working directory in Puhti has a new directory\n`zebrafish` that contains the files that were previously uploaded from Mahti to\nAllas:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ ls zebrafish/\nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.1.bt2      Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.3.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.2.bt2      Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.4.bt2\nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.1.bt2  Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.2.bt2  Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa.fai\n```\n\n## Example 2: Using Allas with Rclone\n\n### A. Uploading data with Rclone\n\nRclone is the power-user tool for Allas. It is good in cases where the data\nmust be stored such that each file is a separate object.\n\n!!! warning\n    Rclone provides a fast and efficient way to use Allas, but you should use\n    it carefully as Rclone operations can **overwrite** and **remove** data\n    both in Allas and in the local disk environment without notifying or asking\n    for confirmation.\n\n    * [Using Allas with Rclone from Puhti and Mahti](./using_allas/rclone.md)\n\nThis example uses the same data as the previous case: in the scratch directory\nof Mahti, we have a subdirectory `genomes/zebrafish` that contains the eight\nfiles listed below:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login11 ~]$ ls /scratch/project_2001659/genomes/zebrafish\nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.1.bt2      Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.2.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.3.bt2      Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.4.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.1.bt2  Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.2.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.fa            Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa.fai\n```\n\nTo copy the content of this directory to Allas, we first set up the Allas\nenvironment:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\n```\n\nThen, we open a connection to Allas using the command `allas-conf`. The command\nasks for the user's CSC password and then lists the Allas projects that the\nuser can access. In this case, we select `project_2001659`:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login11 ~]$ allas-conf\nPlease enter CSC password for account kkayttaj: <password>\nChecking projects available for your account.\nPlease wait.\n1) project_2000982     2) project_2001659     3) project_2000136      4) abort allas_conf\nPlease choose a project by giving an item number from the list above: 2\nConfiguration will be done for project: project_2001659\nProtocols:\n  swift\nConnection stays active for eight hours.\n```\n\nThe `allas-conf` procedure above defines an Allas connection that is valid for\neight hours. Next, we go to the `genomes` directory:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2001659/genomes\n```\n\nInstead of `a-put` that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
