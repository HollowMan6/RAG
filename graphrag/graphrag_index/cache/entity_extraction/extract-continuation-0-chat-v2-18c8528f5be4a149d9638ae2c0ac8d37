You need to plan how to manage your keys before you\n   start to use data encryption, more details on this can be found in\n   [Key management](#key-management).\n2. **Using poor encryption tools.** Picking just some nice or reliable looking\n   software to take care of encryption may well introduce a risk of exposing\n   the data content. It may be unintentional like poor software engineering or\n   weak algorithms in the software. It may also be intentional, a deliberate\n   attack targeted to data which is considered important enough to be\n   encrypted. See [Standards and algorithms](#standards-and-algorithms) and\n   [Notes on specific software](#notes-on-specific-software).\n\nThe SD Connect service mitigates these risks by applying automatically strong\nasymmetric encryption for the stored data. The service also adds a CSC-hosted\nencryption key to the data. This can be used in cases where the users own\nencryption key is lost.\n\n## Best practices\n\nCopying sensitive data from a customer's own protected environment to CSC's\ndata service requires protecting the data both in transit and at rest on CSC's\ndata service.\n\nAccess to these services is protected in transit by encrypted traffic based on\nHTTPS/TLS.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, protecting data at rest on a remote service is\nbest done by protecting it with client-side encryption and not exposing the\nencryption related keys to the storage service. Client-side encryption is a\nmethod where the customer encrypts the data in the customer's own environment\nbefore transferring it to the service. When using client-side encryption and\nnot exposing the keys, the customer is the only party who controls exposing the\ncontent of the data.[^4] [^6] Even with this, it is good to remember that\nencryption should not be the only protection; storing securely at a remote\nlocation should always be a layered approach with more than one measure, i.e.\nclear user roles and access control definitions, least privileges principle,\netc.[^5]\n\nThe data which is stored at CSC's data service should not be the only existing\ncopy of the data.\n\nMake sure you don't leak sensitive information in file or directory names.\nEither anonymize or randomize such names or create a package — for\ninstance zip or tar — of the files/directories and then encrypt the whole\npackage.\n\n### Standards and Algorithms\n\n*Symmetric encryption algorithm* to use is AES (either in CBC or CTR mode, but\nnever in ECB) with minimum key length of 256 bits, thus an AES-256 encryption.\n\nAES-128 and AES-192 are also currently considered to be strong enough, but as\nthe performance penalty is rather small between those and AES-256, and with the\nfact that switching later to a stronger version of AES would mean re-encrypting\nall the data, it is better to start straight with AES-256.[^2] [^3]\n\n*Asymmetric encryption algorithm* to use is RSA and the minimum key length is\n4096 bits.[^2] [^3]\n\nSymmetric encryption software usually gives an option to use a passphrase as a\n\"user-friendly key\". The actual encryption key is then derived from this\npassphrase using a key derivation algorithm. The key derivation algorithm must\nalso be strong enough, preferred ones are scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 (with high\niteration count, for instance 100 000).[^2] [^8]\n\n### Key management\n\nSymmetric encryption software usually give an option to use a password, or a\npassphrase as a \"user-friendly key\". In those cases, the protection of your\ndata is only as good as the encryption password is; encryption does not help if\nyou use a weak or an easy-to-guess password. Guidance on how to create strong\npasswords can be found for instance in references.[^9]\n\nLeaking a symmetric or asymmetric decryption passphrase/key means that you must\nencrypt the original content with a new passphrase/key, and replace all stored\nold passphrase/key encrypted data with the new encrypted data. This holds true\nalso for asymmetric keys in data at rest, unlike other use cases where key\nrevocation could be used.\n\nLosing your symmetric data encryption passphrase/keys is equivalent to data\nloss. You, or your research project should have either a copy of data content\nlocally available (in plain format or encrypted with some other key), or a\nmethod to recover the encryption keys to access the data content even if the\noriginal data encrypting party loses the passphrase/keys. Consult your local\norganization where and how to save your encryption passphrase/keys securely for\nrecovery purposes.\n\nData decryption passphrase/key information must be transferred securely between\nthe encrypting party and the decrypting party. This is often referred to as Key\nTransport.\n\nAsymmetric encryption is the easiest way to manage data encryption key\ntransport with several keyholders, as public keys can be — as the name suggests\n— public and exchanged openly. There are also existing Public Key\nInfrastructures or \"web of trusts\" that can certify the origin of the public\nkey. Being sure that a public key is the desired recipient's public key is\nessential as whoever holds the corresponding private key can decrypt data which\nis encrypted with the public key. In this kind of hybrid encryption systems,\nthe symmetric data encryption key is encrypted with an asymmetric public key\nand then transported together with the encrypted data.\n\nFor a small group of parties also a face-to-face data decryption key transport\ncan be an option.\n\nStoring and retrieving encrypted data from the CSC's service can also be\narranged at the customer's local environment so that the trusted local\nenvironment has a service that takes care of accessing the CSC's storage\nservice on behalf of the end user.
