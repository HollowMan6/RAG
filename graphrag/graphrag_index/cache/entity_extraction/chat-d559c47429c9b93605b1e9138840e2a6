These kinds of tasks are often called\n_embarrassingly parallel_ jobs, or collectively _task farming_, since they can, in principle,\nbe distributed to as many processors as there are tasks to run.\n\nArray jobs may be a suitable approach if:\n\n1. The runtime of each independent job is long enough for the SLURM batch system\n    overhead to be irrelevant.\n    * Individual runtimes are longer than about 30 minutes.\n2. The total number of independent jobs is not excessively large.\n    * A user can only have up to 400 jobs either running or queuing on the batch\n      system.\n\n!!! note \"Other options\"\n    When the runtimes are very short or the number of individual jobs is very large,\n    there are more suitable options for running high-throughput calculations.\n    The recommended tool for these use cases is [HyperQueue](../../apps/hyperqueue.md).\n    Alternatives include the\n    [Linux `xargs` utility](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/xargs.html)\n    (see [this batch script](https://a3s.fi/pub/xargsjob.sh) for a usage example)\n    and the [GNU Parallel shell tool](../../support/tutorials/many.md).\n\n## Defining an array job\n\nIn Slurm, an array job is defined using the option `--array` or `-a`, e.g.\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --array=1-100\n```\n\nwill launch not just one batch job, but 100 batch jobs where the subjob specific environment\nvariable `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` has a value ranging from 1 to 100. This variable can then\nbe utilized in the actual job launching commands so that each subtask gets processed. All\nsubjobs are launched in the batch job system at once, and they are executed using as many\nprocessors as are available.\n\nIn addition to defining a job range, you can also provide a list of job index values, e.g.\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --array=4,7,22\n```\n\nwould launch three jobs with `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` values 4, 7 and 22.\n\nYou can also include step size in the job range definition. The array job definition\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --array=1-100:20\n```\n\nwould run five jobs with `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` values: 1, 21, 41, 61 and 81.\n\nIn some cases, it may be reasonable to limit the number of simultaneously running processes.\nThis is done with the notation `%max_number_of_jobs`. For example, in a case were you have\n100 jobs but a license for only five simultaneous processes, you could ensure that you will\nnot run out of license using the definition\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --array=1-100%5\n```\n\n## A simple array job example\n\nAs a first array job example, let's assume that we have 50 datasets (`data_1.inp`, `data_2.inp`\n... `data_50.inp`) that we would like to analyze using the program `my_prog` that uses the syntax\n\n```bash\nmy_prog inputfile outputfile\n```\n\nEach of the subtasks requires less than two hours of computing time and less than 4 GB of memory.\nWe can perform all 50 analysis tasks with the following batch job script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=array_job\n#SBATCH --output=array_job_out_%A_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --error=array_job_err_%A_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4000\n#SBATCH --array=1-50\n\n# run the analysis command\nmy_prog data_${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.inp data_${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.out\n```\n\nIn the batch job script, the line `#SBATCH --array=1-50` defines that 50 subjobs will be submitted.\nThe other `#SBATCH` lines refer to individual subjobs. In this case, one subjob uses at most one\nprocessor (`--ntasks=1`), 4 GB of memory (`--mem-per-cpu=4000`), and can last up to two hours\n(`--time=02:00:00`). However, the total wall clock time needed to process all 50 tasks is not\nlimited.\n\nIn the job execution commands, the script utilizes the `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` variable in\nthe definition of the input and output files so that the first subjob will run the command\n\n```bash\nmy_prog data_1.inp data_1.out\n```\n\nthe second one will run the command\n\n```bash\nmy_prog data_2.inp data_2.out\n```\n\nand so forth.\n\nThe job can be now launched using the command\n\n```bash\nsbatch job_script.sh\n```\n\nTypically, not all jobs are executed at once. However, after a while, a large number of jobs may\nbe running simultaneously. When the batch job is finished, the `data_dir` directory contains 50\noutput files.\n\nAfter submitting an array job, the command\n\n```bash\nsqueue -l -u <username>\n```\n\nreveals that you have one pending job and possibly several other jobs running in the batch job\nsystem. All these jobs have a `jobid` that contains\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
