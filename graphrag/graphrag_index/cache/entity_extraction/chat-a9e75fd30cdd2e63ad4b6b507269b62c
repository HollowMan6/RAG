Before that, you need to umount the volume in every VM node. These are the two commands you need to run. The second one only needs to be executed in a single node:\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo umount /mnt\n    sudo tunefs.ocfs2 -N 25 /dev/vdb\n    ```\n\n    Secondly, create the new node, install the required software and attach the volume using openstack API. The process is described above.\n\n    Then you need to edit the file `/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf` in every node and add an entry for the new one:\n\n    ```yaml\n    node:\n      ip_port = 7777\n      ip_address = <ip_address>\n      number = <number>\n      name = <vm_name>\n      cluster = ocfs2\n    ```\n\n    Replace `<ip_address>` by the address of the new server, `<vm_name>` by its name, and finally `<number>` is the node id number. It has to be unique for every node, ideally consecutive numbers.\n\n    Once the file is updated, you need to stop the mount and restart the `ocfs2` in every node in the cluster. Lastly, remount the volume in every VM node.\n\n* **What happens if a VM gets disconnected?**\n\n    This covers two different use cases, a temporal and/or unexpected disconnection, and a permanent one. It is very similar to the GFS2 situation.\n\n    For a temporal and unexpected disconnection, the cluster should be able to deal with this kind of issues automatically. After the node is back, you need to check that all came back to normal. In some cases the automatic mount of the volume can fail, if so mount the volume as explained above.\n\n    If it is temporal but expected, like to update the kernel version. Umount the volume in the node (`sudo umount /mnt`) before rebooting the node. It is not required, but recommended.\n\n    For a permanent disconnection of a VM, one need to do the inverse process of adding a new node. Umount the volume (`sudo umount /mnt`), remove the entry for this VM in the `/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf` file of every node, and finally restart the daemons in every node. This needs to be done as it affects the quorum count for the cluster.\n\n* **Is it possible to mount a node as read-only?**\n\n    Yes, it is possible to mount the volume as read-only. It is as simple as:\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo mount /dev/vdb /mnt -o ro\n    ```\n\n    After that, you can check that it was indeed mounted as read-only by:\n\n    ```sh\n    mount | grep /mnt\n    /dev/vdb on /mnt type ocfs2 (ro,relatime,_netdev,heartbeat=local,nointr,data=ordered,errors=remount-ro,atime_quantum=60,coherency=full,user_xattr,acl)\n    ```\n    Also, as you can see in the output above, the default behaviour is that when any error occurs, to remount it as read only (`errors-remount-ro`). See `mount.ocfs2` for more options.\n\n* **I want to install Oracle Kernel on a RedHat 9 distro**  \n\n    You can find more information [here](https://yum.oracle.com/getting-started.html#red-hat-enterprise-linux-centos) on how to install the Oracle Linux repo. Once set, you can install the Oracle UEK kernel with these commands:\n\n    First\n    ```sh\n    sudo dnf install oraclelinux-release-el9\n    ```\n\n    And then\n    ```sh\n    sudo dnf install kernel-uek\n    ```\n\n## Upstream documentation\n\n- GFS2: \n    - <https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_gfs2_file_systems/index>\n- OCFS2: \n    - <https://ocfs2.wiki.kernel.org/>\n    - <https://public-yum.oracle.com/>\n    - <https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/9/shareadmin/shareadmin-ManagingtheOracleClusterFileSystemVersion2inOracleLinux.html#about-ocfs2>\n    - <https://docs.oracle.com//en/learn/ocfs2_cluster_linux_8/#introduction>\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
