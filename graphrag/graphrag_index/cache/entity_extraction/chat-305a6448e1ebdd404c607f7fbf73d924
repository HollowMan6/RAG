Billing units are consumed as follows:\n\n| Resource         | Billing units |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| Pod core hour    | 1             |\n| Pod RAM GB hour  | 1,5           |\n| Storage TiB hour | 3             |\n\n\n!!! info\n\n    Currently, Rahti 2 does not bill for the stored images.\n\nLet's see an example. You create a pod with the following specs:\n\n* 1 core\n* 512 MiB RAM\n\nand the current real usage is:\n\n* 0.5 cores\n* 1 GiB RAM\n\nYou also create a persistent volume of size 10 GiB and attach it to the pod. The\ncost in BUs can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe core usage is 0.5 cores and the request is 1 cores. According to the BU consumption rate 1 > 0.5 so 1 is used.\n\nThe memory usage is 1 GiB and the request is 512 MiB. The same goes for memory usage 1 GiB > 512 MiB so 1 GiB is used\n\n![BU calculation](../img/BU-calculation.drawio.svg)\n\n<!--\n## Billing unit calculator\n\nFor an estimate of the billing units the services you plan on using will consume, please refer to the\nbilling unit calculator below. The [billing unit calculator can also be found at MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/buc/).\n\n<iframe srcdoc=\"https://my.csc.fi/buc\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 1300px; border: 0\"></iframe>\n\n-->\n## Cost Change when migrating from Rahti 1 to Rahti 2\n\nWhile migrating from Rahti 1 to Rahti 2, BU calculation will be changed. The main differences in calculation are:\n\n* In Rahti 1, BU’s are calculated based on requested resources while in Rahti 2, BU’s are calculated based on current uses. If current uses is lower than the minimum requested resource, requested resource is used for the calculation.\n* BU for Pod core hour in Rahti 1 is 0.5 and in Rahti 2 it is 1.\n* BU for Pod RAM GiB hour in Rahti 1 is 1 where in Rahti 2 It is 1.5.\n\nNote : BU for Storage TiB hour is same i.e. 3.\n\nSo, in case of the above example the BU calculation for Rahti 1 is\n\n![BU calculation for Rahti 1](./images/Rahti1BU.drawio.svg)\n\n\nDefault limits in Rahti 2 can be set lower than the default quota. Where in Rahti 1 default limit is same as default quota. For more details [Migration to Rahti 2](../rahti/rahti-migration.md). This can decrease the default costs for the user. For the same example the BU For Rahti 1:\n\n![Default cost for Rahti 1](./images/Rahti1Requests.drawio.svg)\n\nand for Rahti 2 BU will lie between \nlimits:\n\n![Default limits for Rahti 2](./images/Rahti2Limits.drawio.svg)\n\nand requests:\n\n![Default requests for Rahti 2](./images/Rahti2Request.drawio.svg)\n\nNote : BU for Storage TiB hour is considered same i.e. 3.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
