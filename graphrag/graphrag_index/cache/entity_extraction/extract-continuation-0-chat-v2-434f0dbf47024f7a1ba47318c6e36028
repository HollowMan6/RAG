The compiler wrappers will\nlink automatically to this library if a GPU target module (`craype-accel-*`) is\nloaded.\n\n=== \"PrgEnv-cray\"\n\n    ```\n    module load PrgEnv-cray\n    module load craype-accel-amd-gfx90a\n    module load rocm\n    ```\n\n=== \"PrgEnv-amd\"\n\n    ```\n    module load PrgEnv-amd\n    module load craype-accel-amd-gfx90a\n    module load rocm\n    ```\n\nThen, for example, we can compile a simple MPI + HIP code with the following\ncommand\n\n```\nCC -xhip -o <yourapp> <mpi_and_hip_code.cpp>\n```\n\nand inspect the linking of the resulting executable. That will show that both\nthe MPI and GPU transfer libraries are linked\n\n``` \n$ ldd ./yourapp | grep libmpi\n    libmpi_cray.so.12 => /opt/cray/pe/lib64/libmpi_cray.so.12\n    libmpi_gtl_hsa.so.0 => /opt/cray/pe/lib64/libmpi_gtl_hsa.so.0\n```\n\n!!! warning \"GPU support needs to be enabled at run time\"\n\n    When running your application, you need to enable the GPU support. This is done by\n    setting the value of `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED` to `1`:\n\n    ```bash\n    export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1\n    ```\n\n## Compile an OpenMP Application\n\nFor all programming environments, the compilation of OpenMP host code is possible by\nenabling OpenMP when invoking the compiler wrappers (`cc`, `CC`, `ftn`). The\nflag to enable OpenMP is `-fopenmp` for all programming environments and \ncompiler wrappers.\n\n!!! info\n\n    When using the OpenMP compiler flag, the wrapper will link to the\n    [multithreaded version of the Cray libraries][libraries].\n\n### Compile an application with OpenMP offloading\n\nUsing the `PrgEnv-cray`, `PrgEnv-amd`, you can compile application using OpenMP\ntarget offloading. Like for OpenMP for the host (CPU), this is done by using the\n`-fopenmp` flag but first you need to load a `craype-accel-*` target module.\n\n=== \"PrgEnv-cray\"\n\n    ```bash\n    module load PrgEnv-cray\n    module load rocm\n    module load craype-accel-amd-gfx90a\n    ```\n\n=== \"PrgEnv-amd\"\n\n    ```bash\n    module load PrgEnv-amd\n    module load craype-accel-amd-gfx90a\n    ```\n\nThe `craype-accel-amd-gfx90a` will instruct the compiler wrappers to \nautomatically add the appropriate flags for OpenMP offloading.\n\n## Compile an OpenACC application\n\nAt the moment, the only compiler that supports OpenACC compilation on LUMI is the\nCray Fortran compiler. OpenACC can be enabled by the `-hacc` flag.\n\n```\nmodule load PrgEnv-cray\nmodule load craype-accel-amd-gfx90a\nmodule load rocm\n\nftn -hacc -o <yourapp> <openacc_source.f90>\n```\n\n## Accessing the programming environment on LUMI\n\nThe Cray programming environment can be accessed in three different ways on LUMI:\n\n1. Right after login, ``PrgEnv-cray`` is loaded as most users familiar with\n   Cray systems would expect. The set of target modules is not adapted to the\n   node that you are on but a set that is safe for the whole system. Users are\n   responsible for managing those modules and swapping with an appropriate set.\n   Executing ``module purge`` will unload the target modules also and cause\n   error messages when you subsequently try to load a programming environment\n   as some modules (including ``cray-mpich`` and ``cray-fftw``) can only be\n   loaded when a suitable target module is loaded.\n\n2. Working in the ``CrayEnv`` [software stack][softwarestacks]: (Re)-loading\n   the ``CrayEnv`` module will (re)set the target modules to an optimal set for\n   the node type that you are on. Executing ``module purge`` will also trigger\n   a reload of ``CrayEnv``, unless the ``--force`` option is used to unload the\n   module.\n\n     The ``CrayEnv`` stack also provides an updated set of build tools and some\n   other tools useful to programmers in a way that they cannot conflict with\n   tools in the ``LUMI`` software stacks (which is why they are not offered in\n   the bare environment).\n\n     We advise users who want to use the Cray programming environment but do not\n   need any of the libraries etc. installed in the ``LUMI`` software stacks to\n   use the ``CrayEnv`` stack rather than the bare environment.\n\n3. Working in the ``LUMI`` [software stack][softwarestacks]: The ``LUMI``\n   software stack offers a range of libraries and packages mostly installed via\n   [EasyBuild][easybuild]. It is possible to install additional software on top\n   of those stacks using EasyBuild, and use those libraries and tools to\n   compile or develop other software\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GPU TRANSFER LIBRARY (GTL)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library that allows direct passing of GPU memory pointers to MPI without copying to the host first)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYPE-ACCEL-AMD-GFX90A<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A GPU target module loaded to support GPU-aware MPI implementations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module loaded alongside craype-accel-amd-gfx90a to support GPU-aware MPI implementations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED<|>EVENT<|>An environment variable set to enable GPU support at runtime for applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming interface supporting multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENACC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming standard for parallel computing developed for simplicity in coding accelerators like GPUs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY FORTAN COMPILER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The only compiler on LUMI that supports OpenACC compilation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing environment where the Cray programming environment can be accessed and includes a range of libraries and packages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software stack on LUMI that provides an updated set of build tools and other programming tools)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPU TRANSFER LIBRARY (GTL)<|>CRAYPE-ACCEL-AMD-GFX90A<|>The GTL is linked automatically when the craype-accel-amd-gfx90a module is loaded<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAYPE-ACCEL-AMD-GFX90A<|>ROCM<|>Both modules are loaded together to support GPU-aware MPI implementations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENMP<|>CRAY FORTAN COMPILER<|>OpenMP host code compilation is enabled by the Cray Fortran Compiler<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENACC<|>CRAY FORTAN COMPILER<|>OpenACC compilation is supported by the Cray Fortran Compiler on LUMI<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>CRAYENV<|>CrayEnv provides an optimal set of modules and tools for programming on LUMI<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
