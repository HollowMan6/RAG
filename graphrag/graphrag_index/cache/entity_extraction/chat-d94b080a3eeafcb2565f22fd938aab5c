Here, we shortly introduce\ntwo of them: **FileZilla** that is available for Windows, macOS and Linux\nmachines, and **WinSCP** that is available for windows. **Cyberduck**, which is\ndiscussed in the [Allas user guide](../Allas/using_allas/cyberduck.md), can be\nused for this purpose too.\n\n## FileZilla â€“ a general file transfer tool\n\nFileZilla is a file transfer tool that you can install on all common operating\nsystems (Windows, macOS, Linux). You can download FileZilla client from the\nFileZilla home page (server is not needed):\n\n- [FileZilla home](https://filezilla-project.org/)\n\nWhen you start FileZilla, a graphical file transfer interface opens to your\nscreen. To open a connection to CSC, define the connection information on the\n_Quickconnect_ row in the upper part of the interface. Alternatively, you can\nuse the _Site Manager_ button to define a connection. You can reuse the\nconnection settings you have made with _Site Manager_ by right-clicking the\n_Site Manager_ button.\n\nFor example, use the following settings for connecting to Puhti:\n\n- Host: `puhti.csc.fi`\n- User / Username: your CSC username\n- Password: your CSC password\n- Port: `22`\n- Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol\n- Logon type: Ask for password\n\nOnce the connection is opened, FileZilla shows two interactive file listings\nside by side. On the left side you have your local file system and on the right\nsite the remote file system (e.g. files on Puhti). You can change your location\nby interactive browsing or by typing a directory path to the _Local site_ or\n_Remote site_ fields.\n\nOnce you have the right directories open on both the local and remote site, you\ncan copy files or directories between the sites simply by selecting a file or\nfolder with your mouse and dragging it to the other site. For other operations,\ntry right-clicking a file or a folder.\n\n![FileZilla interface](/img/filezilla.jpg 'FileZilla interface')\n\n## File transfer on Windows with WinSCP\n\nWinSCP is a free open source program for Windows. It provides secure file\ntransfer between a local and remote computer. WinSCP supports SFTP, FTP and SCP\ntransfer protocols. WinSCP has many features that make operating with files\nsimple. The installation documentation for WinSCP is available at the\n[official website](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/installation).\n\nThere are two graphical user interfaces in WinSCP: _Explorer_ and _Commander_.\nYou select your default interface during the installation of WinSCP, but you\ncan change it later in the preferences dialogue. The Explorer interface looks\nand works similar to Windows Explorer. If you are familiar with Windows\nExplorer, you will probably find using WinSCP Explorer interface easier.\n\nStart WinSCP and enter your login information like hostname, username, password\nand the server's protocol. In the Explorer interface, you can drag and drop\nfiles between WinSCP and Windows Explorer to transfer them. In order to do\nother operations, right-click any object in the interface and select the\noperation from the pop-up menu. It is also possible to right-click a file or a\ndirectory, and drag it to another location.\n\nThere are many basic operations that you can do with WinSCP:\n\n- Navigating\n- Uploading files\n- Downloading files\n- Managing connections\n- Editing/opening files\n- Synchronizing a local directory with a remote one, and vice versa\n- Changing properties (permissions, ownership, etc.) of remote files\n- Renaming files\n- Deleting files\n- Moving and duplicating remote files\n- Creating new objects\n- Creating files\n- Creating directories\n- Creating links and short-cuts\n\n### Uploading files to CSC environment\n\nYou can use the different tools of WinSCP to upload files to CSC's computing\nenvironment. The easiest methods are drag and drop with your mouse, using copy\nand paste, as well as using Windows Explorer's _Send To_ feature.\n\nWhen using drag and drop, select the local files you want to upload e.g.\ninside Windows Explorer. Then, drag selected files with your mouse and drop\nthem to the remote panel in the WinSCP interface.\n\nWhen using copy and paste, select the local files you want to upload e.g.\ninside Windows Explorer and copy them to the clipboard. Then, move to the\nWinSCP interface and select _File|Paste_ from the menu (or _Ctrl+V_). Note: if\nyour clipboard content is a plain text string only, _File|Paste_ operation will\nwork differently. In this case it will open the path stored on the clipboard\ninstead of pasting the files.\n\nYou can use Windows Explorer's _\"Send To\"_ feature to upload files to a server.\nTo enable this feature, use the installer or select the feature in preferences\n(\"add upload short cut to Explorer's 'sent to' context menu\").\n\n![WinSCP interface](/img/Winscp1.jpg 'WinSCP interface')\n\n### Downloading files from CSC environment\n\nThe easiest ways to download files are drag and drop with a mouse and using URL\naddresses. When using drag and drop, first select the remote files you want to\ndownload in the remote panel of the WinSCP interface. Then, drag the selected\nfiles with your mouse and drop them to the local directory e.g. in Windows\nExplorer.\n\nYou can register WinSCP to handle SFTP and SCP protocol\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
