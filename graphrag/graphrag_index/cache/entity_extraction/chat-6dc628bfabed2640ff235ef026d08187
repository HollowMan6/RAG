A **dataset** (also spelled *data set*) is *a\nstructured and stable collection of data generally associated with a unique\nbody of work (for example a research study)*. In order for a dataset to be\nreusable for research purposes, the dataset needs to be FAIR (findable,\naccessible, interoperable, reusable). This means that it needs to, e.g., have a\nunique [identifier](publishing-datasets.md#persistent-identifiers) such as a\nDOI or URN, sufficient [metadata](metadata-and-documentation.md#metadata-types)\nincluding provenance and creator information, and a\n[license](publishing-datasets.md#licensing-rights) enabling reuse. Datasets\nalso need to fulfill discipline-specific requirements and standards. More about\nthe difference between data and dataset in\n[Data types](publishing-datasets.md#data-types).\n\nDatasets are the cornerstone of data-driven computing and data analysis.\nDatasets allow focusing on the origin, life cycle and ethical use of data\nresources instead of the technicalities of single data files or computing\nmethods. CSC provides services for dataset-oriented research and develops\nfuture services to better support datasets and other higher-level aspects of\ndata.\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    The ownership, copyrights and license of data is often best defined for the\n    whole dataset, though, in some cases finer-grained definitions might be\n    needed. In scientific writing a dataset is usually cited as a single\n    entity.\n\n## Gathering datasets\n\nThe first phase of dataset-driven work is where datasets are gathered. It is\npossible to locate and take into use existing, well-defined datasets, or to\ncreate new datasets by sourcing data and organizing it into datasets. The\ngathering phase lays the foundation on which data-driven computing and analysis\nis built on. During this phase, the focus should be on making sure licenses and\nterms of use for data are known and match the intended use, asserting that the\norigin for data is known for good provenance and that data is organized and\ndocumented well.\n\n**What if the dataset terms of use are made by the producers themselves?**  \nThe dataset creator reserves the right to specify the terms of use for their\ndataset, even without ready-made licenses. In such cases, the terms of use\nspecified must be observed, but you can also negotiate the terms of use by\ncontacting the owner of the dataset.\n\n**What if no terms of use have been specified for data?**  \nIf there are no terms of use or the terms of use given are unclear, you should\nalways contact the owner of the dataset in question.\n\n## Discover research data\n\nWhen utilizing and re-using data collected or produced by others, the origin,\ncontent, location, license, restrictions of use, and other necessary\ninformation are needed. Search services include descriptive information\n(metadata) on research datasets. The better the description of the dataset is,\nthe easier it is to find and use it. Existing research datasets may be\navailable for reuse.\n\n[See CSC's services for discovering datasets](https://research.csc.fi/service-catalog#open)\n\n## Specific datasets hosted in CSC computing environment\n\nCSC also hosts or provides access to several datasets on different platforms.\n\n### Biosciences\n\n- [Chipster_genomes](../../apps/chipster_genomes.md) Tool to download aligner\n  indexes used by the [Chipster software](https://chipster.csc.fi/index.shtml)\n  to Puhti\n- [AlphaFold databases are available on Puhti](../../apps/alphafold.md)\n\n### Chemistry\n\n- [CSD - Cambridge Crystallographic Database](../../apps/csd.md) ‚Äì organic and\n  metallo-organic crystal structures and tools\n- [Molport 6M molecule database](../../support/tutorials/gpu-shape.md)\n  preprocessed for fast GPU screening with Schr√∂dinger Shape\n\n### Geosciences\n\n- [Open Finnish spatial datasets are available in Puhti or in Allas](spatial-data-in-csc-computing-env.md).\n\n### Language research and other digital humanities and social sciences\n\n- The latest versions of\n  [CLARIN PUB or ACA licensed corpora](https://www.kielipankki.fi/corpora/) are\n  available unpacked on Puhti in `/appl/data/kielipankki/`\n\n## Processing and analyzing data\n\nRead more in [CSC's Data analysis guide](../../support/tutorials/da-guide.md)\n\n[CSC's services for processing and analyzing data](https://research.csc.fi/en/service-catalog#compute)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
