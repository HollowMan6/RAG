Both snapshot types can be utilized\nwhen creating a new instance. Image snapshots are more common.\n\n### Instance snapshot\n\n#### Instance snapshot from the web interface\n\nSelect 'Instances' tab, under 'Compute', from the left hand side menu (**1**).\nSelect the virtual machine you want to take a snapshot of from the list\nand click the 'Create Snapshot' button in the 'Actions' column (**2**).\n\n![Creating a snapshot from the web interface.](../img/cloud_pouta_vm_snapshot_1.svg)\n\nGive the snapshot a descriptive name (**3**) and click 'Create Snapshot' (**4**)\nto start the process.\n\n![Naming the snapshot and launching creation.](../img/cloud_pouta_vm_snapshot_2.svg)\n\nYou can access a list of snapshots from the 'Images' tab.\n\n#### Instance snapshot from the CLI\n\n!!! info\n\n    Ensure you have sourced the OpenStack RC file and can communicate with your OpenStack environment.\n\nUse the following [command](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/server.html#server-list){target=\"_blank\"} to check the list of available instances:\n\n```\n$ openstack server list\n```\n\nThe result should look something like this:\n\n```\n+--------------------------------------+--------------------+--------+---------------------------------------------+--------------+----------------+\n| ID                                   | Name               | Status | Networks                                    | Image        | Flavor         |\n+--------------------------------------+--------------------+--------+---------------------------------------------+--------------+----------------+\n| db2214e7-2175-4a82-9e3b-0a1892a6066a | important-linux-vm | ACTIVE | project_2007938=192.168.1.10, 86.50.230.174 | Ubuntu-22.04 | standard.small |\n+--------------------------------------+--------------------+--------+---------------------------------------------+--------------+----------------+\n```\n\nSelect the wanted instance, either by ID or name, and issue the following [command](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/server-image.html){target=\"_blank\"}:\n\n```\n$ openstack server image create --name important-linux-vm-snapshot-20320912-cli important-linux-vm\n```\n\nHere the name of the server instance was used instead of the ID.
