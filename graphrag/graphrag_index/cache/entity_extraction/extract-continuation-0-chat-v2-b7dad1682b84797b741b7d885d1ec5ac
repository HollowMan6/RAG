It is part\nof our [Machine learning guide](ml-guide.md).\n\n\n## Puhti, Mahti or LUMI?\n\nPuhti and Mahti are CSC's two national supercomputers. Of the two,\nPuhti has the larger number of GPUs (NVIDIA V100) and offers the\nwidest selection of installed software, while Mahti has a smaller\nnumber of faster newer generation NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The CSC-hosted\nEuropean supercomputer\n[LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/) provides a\nmassive GPU resource based on AMD GPUs.\n\nThe main GPU-related statistics are summarized in the table below.\n\n|       | GPU type           | GPU memory  | GPU nodes | GPUs/node | Total GPUs    |\n|-------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| Puhti | NVIDIA Volta V100  | 32 GB       | 80        | 4         | 320           |\n| Mahti | NVIDIA Ampere A100 | 40 GB       | 24        | 4         | 96            |\n| LUMI  | AMD MI250x         | 64 (128) GB | 2978      | 8 (4)     | 23824 (11912) |\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n\n    Each LUMI node has 4 MI250x GPUs, however 8 GPUs will be available\n    through Slurm as the MI250x card features 2 GPU dies (GCDs). The table\n    above shows the GPU die specific numbers, MI250x card specific numbers\n    are shown in parenthesis.\n\nPlease read our [usage policy for the GPU\nnodes](../../computing/usage-policy.md#gpu-nodes). Also consider that\nthe Slurm queuing situation may vary between the different\nsupercomputers at different times, so it may be worth checking out all\nthe options. For example LUMI has a huge number of GPUs available, and\nqueuing times are very short (as of summer 2023).\n\nNote that all supercomputers have distinct file systems, so you need\nto manually copy your files if you wish to change the system. **In\ncase you are unsure which supercomputer to use, Puhti is a good\ndefault** as it has a wider set of software supported.\n\n\n## Available machine learning software\n\nWe support [a number of\napplications](../../apps/by_discipline.md#data-analytics-and-machine-learning)\nfor GPU-accelerated machine learning on CSC's supercomputers,\nincluding [TensorFlow](../../apps/tensorflow.md) and\n[PyTorch](../../apps/pytorch.md).  Please read the detailed\ninstructions for the specific application that you are interested in.\n\nYou need to use the [module system](../../computing/modules.md) to\nload the application you want, for example:\n\n```bash\nmodule load tensorflow/2.12\n```\n\nPlease note that our modules already include CUDA and cuDNN libraries, so there\nis no need to load cuda and cudnn modules separately!\n\nOn LUMI you need to first enable the module repository for CSC's installations:\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles/\n```\n\nFinally, on Puhti, we provide some special applications which are not shown by\ndefault in the module system. These have been made available due to user\nrequests, but with limited support. You can enable them by running:\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/soft/ai/singularity/modulefiles/\n```\n\n### Installing your own software\n\nIn many cases, our existing modules provide the required framework, but some\npackages are missing. In this case you can often load the appropriate module and\nthen [install additional packages for personal use with the `pip` package\nmanager](../../apps/python.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).\n\nFor more complex software requirements, we recommend using\n[tykky](../../computing/containers/tykky.md) or [creating your own\nApptainer container](../../computing/containers/creating.md).\n\n\n## Running GPU jobs\n\nTo submit a GPU job to the Slurm workload manager, you need to use the `gpu`\npartition on Puhti or `gpusmall` or `gpumedium` on Mahti, and specify the type\nand number of GPUs required using the `--gres` flag. \n\nOn LUMI you need to use one of the GPU-partitions such as `dev-g`,\n`small-g` or `standard-g`.\n\nBelow are example batch scripts for reserving one GPU and a\ncorresponding proportion of the CPU cores and memory of a single node:\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpu\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10\n    #SBATCH --mem=64G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1\n        \n    srun python3 myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpusmall\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:1\n    \n    srun python3 myprog.py\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of CSC's national supercomputers, equipped with NVIDIA V100 GPUs and a wide selection of installed software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC national supercomputer with a smaller number of faster, newer generation NVIDIA A100 GPUs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC-hosted European supercomputer providing a massive GPU resource based on AMD GPUs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Center for Scientific Computing, which hosts supercomputers Puhti, Mahti, and LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA V100<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPU model used in Puhti supercomputer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA A100<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPU model used in Mahti supercomputer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMD MI250X<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPU model used in LUMI supercomputer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENSORFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source machine learning framework supported on CSC's supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, supported on CSC's supercomputers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is one of the national supercomputers hosted by CSC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC<|>Mahti is one of the national supercomputers hosted by CSC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>CSC<|>LUMI is a European supercomputer hosted by CSC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA V100<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti supercomputer is equipped with NVIDIA V100 GPUs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA A100<|>MAHTI<|>Mahti supercomputer uses NVIDIA A100 GPUs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMD MI250X<|>LUMI<|>LUMI supercomputer is powered by AMD MI250x GPUs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TENSORFLOW<|>CSC<|>TensorFlow is supported on CSC's supercomputers for machine learning applications<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>CSC<|>PyTorch is supported on CSC's supercomputers for machine learning applications<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
