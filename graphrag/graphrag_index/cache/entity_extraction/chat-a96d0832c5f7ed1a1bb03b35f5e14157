If you are accessing another MySQL server replace the server name (`kaivos.csc.fi`) in script the server name you are using.\n\n## Write a MYSQL database access script\n\nUse your favorite text editor to create a named script file e.g. _mydb_script.pl_ . Then copy the following text to the script.\n\n```perl\n# mydb_script.pl script to show MySQL server version\nuse strict;\nuse DBI;\nmy $dbh = DBI->connect (\"DBI:mysql:your_database_name:kaivos.csc.fi\",\n\"your_database_user_account\", \"your_database_password\") or die \"Cannot connect:\" . $DBI::errstr;\n \nmy $sth = $dbh->prepare (\"SELECT VERSION()\") or die \"Cannot prepare:\" . $dbh->errstr();\n$sth->execute () or die \"Cannot execute: \" . $sth->errstr();\n\nwhile (my @row = $sth->fetchrow_array())\n   {\n       print \"@row\\n\";\n   }\n$dbh->disconnect ();\n```\n\nThe connection to the database is established by invoking the `connect()` method with the connection parameters. These parameters are: the database to use, database server, database user account and database password. Replace these values corresponding your database, database user account and database password. The `prepare()` method prepares the SQL statement and `execute()` method sends statement to the database server. The `fetchrow_array()` method retrieves rows from the result set in a loop, and the resulting rows are printed. Finally the connection is closed by `disconnect()` method.\n\n## Running the MYSQL database access script\n\nRun the script from the command line with Perl interpreter. We recommend using bioperl in CSC environment, because it contains the required modules.\n\n```text\nmodule load biokit\nperl mydb_script.pl\n```\n\nor add following to the beginning of the script:\n\n```bash\n#!/appl/soft/bio/bioperl/5.30.0/bin/perl\n```\n\nThen make the script executable and run it directly:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x mydb_script.pl\n./mydb_script.pl\n```\n\n### The statements issuing methods\n\nThe `prepare()` method is for preparing the SQL statement and `execute()` method is for issuing SQL statements. However, you can use the `do()` method for non repeated non-SELECT statement (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), because no data is returned from the database:\n\n```perl\n$rows_affected = $dbh->do(\"UPDATE your_table SET foo = foo + 1\");\n```\n\n### Transaction\n\nBy default AutoCommit mode is on. You do not need to use `commit()` method while making transactions. Only InnoDB storage engine is transactional. The default MyISAM is a non-transactional storage engine.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
