Therefore, when containerizing applications\nand creating images we need to decouple the generic image content from the\ncustomizable configuration information. This is mainly done to keep the\ncontainerized applications portable. Kubernetes and Openshift have two types\nof abstractions called Secrets and ConfigMaps that can be used to inject\ncontextual information (configuration) into containers during startup and\navoid hardcoding them in images. A good example use case for ConfigMaps and\nSecrets are application (service) admin passwords and their configuration files.\nService passwords can be set as Secrets and added to containers as environment\nvariables, and configuration files can be stored as ConfigMaps that can be\nmounted under containers as files on startup.\n\n!!! info\n\n    It is highly recommended to check out the basic [Kubernetes and Openshift concepts](../rahti2/concepts.md) \n    before moving on, especially if you are not familiar with them already. You can also practice [deploying a simple static webserver](elemental_tutorial.md) \n    to get some hands-on experience. \n\n## ConfigMap\n\n**ConfigMaps** are useful in collecting configuration type data in Kubernetes\nobjects. Their contents are communicated to containers by environmental\nvariables or volume mounts.\n\n*`configmap.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\nkind: ConfigMap\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: my-config-map\ndata:\n  data.prop.a: hello\n  data.prop.b: bar\n  data.prop.long: |-\n    fo=bar\n    baz=notbar\n```\n\n### Create a ConfigMap\n\nConfigMaps can be created in various ways. If we have a ConfigMap object definition\nas listed above in `configmap.yaml`, then, an instance of it can be created using\nthe `oc create -f configmap.yaml` command. You can also use the more specific\ncommand `oc create configmap <configmap_name> [options]` to create an instance\nof a ConfigMap from directories, specific files, or literal values.\nFor example, if you have a directory with files containing the data needed to\npopulate a ConfigMap as follows:\n\n```sh\n$ ls example-dir\ndata.prop.a\ndata.prop.b\ndata.prop.long\n```\n\nYou can then create a ConfigMap similar to the one defined in `configmap.yaml` as:\n\n```sh\noc create configmap my-config-map \\\n    --from-file=example-dir/\n```\n\nThis command also works with files instead of directories.\n\n### Use a ConfigMap\n\nThe following pod imports the value of `data.prop.a` to the `DATA_PROP_A`\nenvironment variable and creates the files `data.prop.a`, `data.prop.b` and\n`data.prop.long` inside `/etc/my-config`:\n\n*`configmap-pod.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\nkind: Pod\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: my-config-map-pod\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  volumes:\n  - name: configmap-vol\n    configMap:\n      name: my-config-map\n  containers:\n  - name: confmap-cont\n    image: perl\n    command:\n    - /bin/sh\n    - -c\n    - |-\n      cat /etc/my-config/data.prop.long &&\n      echo \"\" &&\n      echo DATA_PROP_A=$DATA_PROP_A\n    env:\n    - name: DATA_PROP_A\n      valueFrom:\n        configMapKeyRef:\n          name: my-config-map\n          key: data.prop.a\n          optional: true     # Run this pod even\n    volumeMounts:            # if data.prop.a is not defined in configmap\n    - name: configmap-vol\n      mountPath: /etc/my-config\n```\n\nDeploy the pod using `oc create -f configmap-pod.yaml` command. The output log, provided with the command `oc logs my-config-map-pod` of this container,\nshould be:\n\n```\nfo=bar\nbaz=notbar\n\nDATA_PROP_A=hello\n```\n\n## Secret\n\nSecrets behave much like ConfigMaps, with the difference that once created they are stored in *base64* encoded form, and their contents are not displayed by default in the command line or in the web interface.\n\n*`secret.yml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\ndata:\n  WebHookSecretKey: dGhpc19pc19hX2JhZF90b2tlbgo=\nmetadata:\n  name: webhooksecret\n```\n\n### Create a secret\n\nAs with any other OpenShift/Kubernetes objects, Secrets can also be created from a Secret object definition.\nFor the definition listed above as `secret.yaml`, a Secret instance can be created using\nthe `oc create -f secret.yaml` command. You can also use the more specific command `oc create secret [flags] <secret_name> [options]`\nto create an instance of a Secret from directories, specific files, or literal values.\nFor example, if you have a file  called `WebHookSecretKey` containing a secret key  you can\nuse it to create an instance of a secret similar to the one specified in the previous `secret.yaml` file\nas follows:\n\n```sh\noc create secret generic webhooksecret \\\n   --from-file=WebHookSecretKey\n```\n\n### Edit a secret\n\nThe process to edit a secret is not trivial. The idea is to retrieve the secret JSON definition, decode it, edit it, and then encode it back and replace it.\n\n* First you need to retrieve the different files/secrets inside the secret (the examples use jq to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
