Below are the general\nguidelines for using the SLURM partitions on our systems:\n\n1. **Use the `test` and `gputest` partitions for testing your code, not production.**\n   These partitions provide access to fewer resources than other partitions,\n   but jobs submitted to them have a higher priority and are thus granted\n   resources before other jobs.\n2. **Only request multiple CPU cores if you know your program supports\n   parallel processing.** Reserving multiple cores does not automatically\n   speed up your job. Your program must be written in a way that the\n   computations can be done in multiple threads or processes. Reserving more\n   cores does nothing by itself, except make you queue for longer.\n3. **Only use the GPU partitions if you know your program can utilize GPUs.**\n   Running your computations using one or more GPUs is a very effective\n   parallelization method for certain applications, but your program must be\n   configured to use the CUDA platform. If you are unsure whether this is the\n   case, it is better to submit it to a CPU partition, since you will be\n   allocated resources sooner. You may also always\n   [consult CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) when in doubt.\n\nThe following commands can be used to show information about available\npartitions:\n\n```bash\n# Display a summary of available partitions\n$ sinfo --summarize\n\n# Display details about a specific partition:\n$ scontrol show partition <partition_name>\n```\n\n!!! info \"LUMI partitions\"\n    The available LUMI batch job partitions are found in the\n    [LUMI documentation].\n\n## Puhti partitions\n\nThe following guidelines apply to the SLURM partitions on Puhti:\n\n1. **Only request the memory you need.** Memory can easily end up being a\n   bottleneck in resource allocation. Even if the desired amount of GPUs\n   and/or CPU cores is continuously available, your job will sit in the queue\n   for as long as it takes for the requested amount of memory to become\n   free. It is thus recommended to only request the amount of memory that is\n   necessary for running your job. Additionally, the amount of billing units\n   consumed by your job is affected by the amount of memory requested, not\n   the amount which was actually used. See\n   [how to estimate your memory requirements](../../support/faq/how-much-memory-my-job-needs.md).\n2. **Only use the `longrun` partitions if necessary.** The `longrun` and\n   `hugemem_longrun` partitions provide access to fewer resources and have a\n   lower priority than the other partitions, so it is recommended to use them\n   only for jobs that *really* require a very long runtime (e.g. if there is no\n   way to checkpoint and restart a computation).\n\n### Puhti CPU partitions\n\nPuhti features the following partitions for submitting jobs to CPU nodes:\n\n| Partition         | Time<br>limit | Max CPU<br>cores | Max<br>nodes | [Node types](../systems-puhti.md) | Max memory<br>per node | Max local storage<br>([NVMe]) per node |\n|-------------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| `test`            | 15 minutes    | 80               | 2            | M                                 | 185 GiB                | n/a                                    |\n| `small`           | 3 days        | 40               | 1            | M, L, IO                          | 373 GiB                | 3600 GiB                               |\n| `large`           | 3 days        | 1040             | 26           | M, L, IO                          | 373 GiB                | 3600 GiB                               |\n| `longrun`         | 14 days       | 40               | 1            | M, L, IO                          | 373 GiB                | 3600 GiB                               |\n| `hugemem`         | 3 days        | 160              | 4            | XL, BM                            | 1496 GiB               | n/a                                    |\n| `hugemem_longrun` | 14 days       | 40               | 1            | XL, BM                            | 1496 GiB               | n/a                                    |\n\n### Puhti GPU partitions\n\nPuhti features the following partitions for submitting jobs to GPU nodes:\n\n| Partition | Time<br>limit | Max<br>GPUs | Max CPU<br>cores | Max<br>nodes | [Node types](../systems-puhti.md) | Max memory<br>per node | Max local storage<br>([NVMe]) per node |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| `gputest` | 15 minutes    | 8           | 80               | 2            | GPU                               | 373 GiB                | 3600 GiB                               |\n| `gpu`     | 3 days        | 80          | 800              | 20           | GPU                               | 373 GiB                | 3600 GiB                               |\n\n!!!
