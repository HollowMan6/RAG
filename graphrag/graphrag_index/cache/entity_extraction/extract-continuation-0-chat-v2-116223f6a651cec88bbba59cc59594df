First, you have to configure a normal, un-encrypted swift-connection to Allas. This can be done with the `allas-conf` script that is included in _allas-cli-utils_ package:\n```text\nsource allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -u your-csc-username -p your-csc-project-name\n```\n\nOnce you have configured a normal swift connection to Allas, you can configure an encrypted bucket to your Allas area. To start the configuration process, run command `rclone config`. \n\nThe `allas-conf` script has already created an `rclone` configuration file with `rclone remote` named as _allas_.\n\nAs the first step, choose option: _n_ to create a _new remote_.\nThe configuration process will ask for a name for the new rclone _remote_.\nIn this case, the new remote is named as named as _allas-crypt_.\n\n<pre>\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login11 ~]$ <b>rclone config</b>\nCurrent remotes:\n\nName                 Type\n====                 ====\nallas                swift\n\ne) Edit existing remote\nn) New remote\nd) Delete remote\nr) Rename remote\nc) Copy remote\ns) Set configuration password\nq) Quit config\ne/n/d/r/c/s/q> <b>n</b>\nname> <b>allas-crypt</b>\n</pre>\nNext the configuration process asks you to configure storage type.\nChoose option 10 _Encrypt/Decrypt a remote_.\n<pre>\nStorage> <b>10</b>\n</pre>\nIn the next step you need to define the Allas bucket, that will be used for encrypted data. When defining the bucket, note that you \nhave to define both the bucket and the site (i.e. rclone remote connection name) where the bucket locates. \nIn the case of Allas, the remote name is _allas:_. The actual bucket name should be unique among all Allas users. \nIn this case we use definition _allas:2001659-crypt_ that defines that the encrypted data will be stored to Allas to bucket _2001659-crypt_.\n<pre>\nRemote to encrypt/decrypt.\nNormally should contain a ':' and a path, eg \"myremote:path/to/dir\",\n\"myremote:bucket\" or maybe \"myremote:\" (not recommended).\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\nremote> <b>allas:2001659-crypt</b>\n</pre>\nNext, the configuration process asks if the object and directory names are encrypted. In this case we will encrypt the names, so you choose _1_ for both cases.\n\nAfter that, you need to define two passwords: a main password and a so called _salt password_. This password pair will be used for the encryption. You can define these passwords yourself or you can let the configuration process to create them. In any case, store securely the passwords you have used. Other users and servers may need to use them, too. Now the setup is ready and there is now a new rclone remote called _allas-crypt_ defined. You can now exit the configuration process.\n\nCurrent remotes:\n<pre>\nName                 Type\n====                 ====\nallas                swift\nallas-crypt          crypt\n\ne) Edit existing remote\nn) New remote\nd) Delete remote\nr) Rename remote\nc) Copy remote\ns) Set configuration password\nq) Quit config\ne/n/d/r/c/s/q><b>q</b>\n</pre>\n \nNow the repository is ready to be used. Say, you have a directory called _job_6_ containing some files and directories:\n<pre>\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login11 ~]$ <b>ls job_6</b>\nhello.xrsl  results  results.1601291937.71  runhello.sh\n</pre>\n\nYou can now upload the content of this directory to the encrypted bucket.\n```text\nrclone copy job_6 allas-crypt:job_6\n```\nThe data has now been copied to Allas and you can check the uploaded files with command:\n<pre><b>rclone ls allas-crypt:job_6</b>\n       77 runhello.sh\n       11 results.1601291937.71/std.out\n       86 results.1601291937.71/std.err\n      117 hello.xrsl\n       11 results/std.out\n       86 results/std.err\n </pre>\n\nThe `allas-crypt remote` translates the data from the encrypted bucket (allas:2001659-crypt) automatically into readable format. However, if you study the content of the encrypted bucket directly, you can see that the object names, as well as the stored data, are in encrypted format:\n\n<pre>[kkayttaj@puhti-login11 ~]$ <b>rclone ls allas:2001659-crypt</b>\n      125 4lpbj55pc5v8t119q0tp2o6k58/36sb832och3tde30k9nlks3dpo\n       59 4lpbj55pc5v8t119q0tp2o6k58/90alcaodph3386197agf252t5b97f144n88e99m9ire5tcpqu380/flqitnrsrc8iloggbc4ouagukg\n      134 4lpbj55pc5v8t\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.
