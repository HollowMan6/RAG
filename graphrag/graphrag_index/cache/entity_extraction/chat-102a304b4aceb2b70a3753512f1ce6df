Both Pouta and Kubernetes-based platforms, such as Rahti 2, are Cloud\nComputing platforms, but there are some important differences. OpenStack-based services, like\ncPouta, are classified as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud services where users can provision their own \ninfrastructure as Virtual Machine. Rahti 2, on the other hand is classifies as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), where users can deploy\ntheir container-based platforms in shared Kubernetes cluster that was hardened to support multi-tenancy.\n\nThe primary difference between IaaS and PaaS services is that with IaaS the user is responsible\nfor managing the operating system and potentially multiple applications whereas with PaaS, the\nuser is only responsible for managing the application and the data. You can read more about cloud\ncomputing concepts [here](concepts.md).\n\nContainers have certain advantages over traditional Virtual machines. Container images are typically\nsmaller and lighter in memory and CPU usage than Virtual machine images. Launching new containers is\nfast, which gives them potential for great scalability. Since container deployment also tends to be\nrelatively easy, continuous deployment and integration practices work very well with container based\napproaches.\n\nUsing a container orchestration service like Rahti 2 that is built on top of Kubernetes, makes the\ndeployment of applications easy. In Rahti 2 you can manage your applications directly using a web\ninterface accessible through a web browser. Rahti 2 provides a platform for you to host your own applications\nand make them accessible over the web. Rahti 2 can run many different kinds of applications and workloads, from web servers\nand databases to data analysis pipelines.\n\nSome example use cases that are well suited for Rahti 2 include:\n\n* Hosting an interactive web application or a regular website. Rahti 2 comes with many of the most common\nfeatures needed for web based applications\n* Complex prepackaged application like Apache Spark. Itâ€™s also easy to scale up applications for multiple\nusers.\n* Deploying from a catalog with many commonly used application templates with just one command.\n\nIn other words, in cases where scalability is needed, or you only want to manage a single application, container\norchestration service might be the way to go.\n\nContainers are inherently not as secure as Virtual machines. With container orchestration services like\nRahti 2 and Openshift containers are not allowed to run with root access, which may provide some limitations\nin certain circumstances and requires further customization to the images. For sensitive data processing tasks, \nit is better to consider other CSC service like ePouta which is always be the preferred platform. It\nis specifically designed for high performance and high security tasks for sensitive data handling with variety\nof available resources.\n\n### Additional information\n\n[What is Rahti 2?](rahti-what-is.md)\n\n[Container clouds fundamentals](https://rahti-course.a3s.fi/basic.html#1)\n\n[Why use containers vs. VMs? |Â VMware](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/vms-vs-containers.html)\n\n[Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs): Whatâ€™s the Difference? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/containers-vs-vms)\n\n[Migrate a service from Kubernetes to OpenShift |Â IBM](https://developer.ibm.com/learningpaths/migrate-kubernetes-openshift/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
