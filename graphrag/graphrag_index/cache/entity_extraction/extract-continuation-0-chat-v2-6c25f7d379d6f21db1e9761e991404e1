It provides an easy\nmethod to install thousands of software packages related to biomedical\nresearch.\n\nCSC has deprecated the direct usage of Conda installations on shared file systems\nof supercomputers (Puhti and Mahti) due to performance\nissues, but you can easily install packages from Bioconda using the\n[Tykky](../../computing/containers/tykky.md) tool instead.\n\nAll packages in Bioconda have a ready-made Docker container image available. While\nthose images could be pulled and used directly, Tykky provides an easy method to\ninstall them in a way that they are usable without any special container commands.\n\n## Example: Installing MetaBAT2 from Bioconda\n\nIn this example we install MetaBAT2 package from Bioconda. To find a software in\nBioconda you can\n[browse them alphabetically](https://bioconda.github.io/conda-package_index.html)\nor use the search. For our example we choose\n[MetaBAT2 package](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/metabat2/README.html).\n\nIn the page find the command to use Docker. In this case:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull quay.io/biocontainers/metabat2:<tag>\n```\n\nFrom the command we need the Docker address:\n\n```bash\nquay.io/biocontainers/metabat2\n```\n\nFrom the Tags page select the desired version. In this case we choose the latest\n(the topmost) version:\n\n```bash\n2.15--h986a166_1\n```\n\nCombine the address and tag to form Docker URL:\n\n```bash\ndocker://quay.io/biocontainers/metabat2:2.15--h986a166_1\n```\n\nLoad the Tykky module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load tykky\n```\n\nWe will use the Tykky\n[wrap-container](../../computing/containers/tykky.md#container-based-installations)\ncommand.\n\nThe `-w` parameter is needed to specify the installation directory inside the\ncontainer. For containers from Bioconda this is always `/usr/local/bin`. For\ncontainers from other sources, please see below.\n\nThe `--prefix` parameter indicates the directory where we want to install the\nenvironment on the shared file system (outside the container). The directory\nneeds to exist, so we we need to create it first. For example:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /projappl/project_2001234/metabat-2.15\n```\n\nWe can now install the software with:\n\n```bash\nwrap-container -w /usr/local/bin docker://quay.io/biocontainers/metabat2:2.15--h986a166_1 --prefix /projappl/project_2001234/metabat-2.15\n```\n\nAfter the installations finishes, the executables for the program will be in directory\n`metabat-2.15/bin`. It should be noted that these are not the actual commands, but\nrather wrapper scripts for the commands inside the container. You can, however, use\nthem as if they were the actual commands. For example:\n\n```bash\n/projappl/project_2001234/metabat-2.15/bin/metabat --help\n```\n\nAdding the `bin` directory to your `$PATH` will work similarly as activating the\nConda environment in case of a direct Conda installation. When the `wrap-container`\ncommand finishes, it will show you the `export` command to do this. The actual command\nwill depend on the installation directory, but will be something like:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"/projappl/project_2001234/metabat-2.15/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nAfter this you can simply do:\n\n```bash\nmetabat --help\n```\n\n!!! note\n    It is generally a bad idea to add Tykky installations permanently to your `$PATH`\n    by e.g. editing your `.bashrc` file. The installation directories often contain\n    common commands like `python` or `perl`. These are specific for each installation,\n    and having them in your default `$PATH` will cause problems with running other\n    software. It's best to add the installation directory to your `$PATH` only when\n    you are using the program. You can e.g. add the `export` command to your\n    [batch job script](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md).\n\n## Containers from other source\n\nYou can use similar steps to create wrappers for containers from other sources, such\nas the [BioContainer registry](https://biocontainers.pro/) or local image files.\nThe software installation location inside the container may vary, so it should be\nchecked in order to set `-w` parameter correctly. In this example we'll use a container\nfor `mono`.\n\nFirst build a local container image:\n\n```bash\napptainer build mono.sif docker://mono:6.12.0.182-slim\n```\n\nYou can now run command `which` inside the container to find out the installation\nlocation.\n\n```bash\napptainer exec mono.sif which mono\n```\n\nIn this case the directory is `/usr/bin`. To install you could use the Docker address\nabove or specify the local image file just created (`mono.sif`).\n\n```bash\nwrap-container -w /usr/bin mono.sif --prefix mono\n```\n\nIn some cases the installation location is not in `$PATH` inside the container, so\n`which` won't work. In those cases you could try running `find` inside the container\ninstead:\n\n```bash\nappt\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIOCONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bioconda is a Conda channel for bioinformatics software, offering an easy method to install biomedical research software packages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC manages supercomputers Puhti and Mahti and has deprecated direct Conda installations on shared file systems due to performance issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tykky is a tool provided by CSC for installing packages from Bioconda on supercomputers without needing special container commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METABAT2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MetaBAT2 is a software package available from Bioconda for bioinformatics analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is one of the supercomputers managed by CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is one of the supercomputers managed by CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUAY.IO/BIOCONTAINERS/METABAT2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker address for the MetaBAT2 package, indicating its container image repository)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOCONDA<|>METABAT2<|>MetaBAT2 is a software package available through Bioconda<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>TYKKY<|>CSC provides the Tykky tool as a solution for installing Bioconda packages on their supercomputers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY<|>METABAT2<|>Tykky is used to install MetaBAT2 on CSC's supercomputers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>CSC manages the Puhti supercomputer and has set policies regarding software installations on it<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MAHTI<|>CSC manages the Mahti supercomputer and has set policies regarding software installations on it<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
