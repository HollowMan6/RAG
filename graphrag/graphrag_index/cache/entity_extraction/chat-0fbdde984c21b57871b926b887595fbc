Plugins: qEDL, qPDALIO, qAnimation and qPCV.\n- CloudCompare 2.10.3 for CPU partitions with more plugins than the GPU version.\n\nGPU version is faster, but consumes also a lot more billing units. Also queues to GPU partitions may be longer.\n\n## Usage\nBoth versions of CloudCompare are available in [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi).\n\n### GPU-accelerated CloudCompare\nGPU-accelerated CloudCompare is available with [Accelerated visualization app](../computing/webinterface/accelerated-visualization.md)\n   \n### Basic CloudCompare\nBasic CloudCompare is available via [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). After launching the remote desktop, double-click CloudCompare icon OR open `Terminal` (Desktop icon) and start CloudCompare:\n\n```\nmodule load cloudcompare\nCloudCompare\n```\n\n## License \n\nCloudCompare is published under the [GNU General Public License](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare/blob/master/license.txt).\n\nYou are free to use CloudCompare for any purpose, including commercially or for education. \n\n\n## Citation\n\n\n`CloudCompare (version 2.10.3) [GPL software].
