We will show you two examples:\n  - The first one is using another pod to copy the content of your persistent volume to Allas.\n  - The second one is a bash script that you have to execute from your local machine.\n\nFor this first example, we will deploy a `nginx` deployment running with a `PersistentVolumeClaim`. We provide the files for testing purposes.\n\n### Preparing a NGINX deployment\n\nFirst, for our tutorial, we will build and deploy a NGINX server.\n\nWe [build](../images/creating.md) our nginx image with this Dockerfile: (since it's not possible to use the regular `nginx` image in OpenShift)\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM nginx:stable\n\nENV LISTEN_PORT=8080\n\n# support running as arbitrary user which belongs to the root group\nRUN chmod g+rwx /var/cache/nginx /var/run /var/log/nginx\n\n# users are not allowed to listen on privileged ports\nRUN sed -i.bak \"s/listen\\(.*\\)80;/listen ${LISTEN_PORT};/\" /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf\n\n# comment user directive as master process is run as user in OpenShift anyhow\nRUN sed -i.bak 's/^user/#user/' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n```\n\nIf you build your image locally, don't forget to [push](../../rahti2/images/Using_Rahti_2_integrated_registry.md) it to your project.  \nYou can deploy this `nginx` server with this Deployment:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  labels:\n    name: nginx\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: <our_custom_nginx_image>\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\n            cpu: \"500m\"\n        ports:\n          - containerPort: 8080\n        volumeMounts:\n        - name: myvol\n          mountPath: /mnt\n      volumes:\n      - name: myvol\n        persistentVolumeClaim:\n          claimName: nginx-pvc\n\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-svc\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: nginx\n  ports:\n  - port: 8080\n\n---\napiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1\nkind: Route\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-route\nspec:\n  host: \"\"\n  path: /\n  to:\n    kind: Service\n    name: nginx-svc\n  tls:\n    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect\n    termination: edge\n\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-pvc\nspec:\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  storageClassName: standard-csi\n```\n\nSave the file and use this command to deploy it: `oc apply -f {name_of_yaml_file}`\nThe deployment is using a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for our example.\n\nNow we have our running `nginx` pod, we want want to copy the content of the PVC to Allas. We will use a new deployment with a `rclone` Docker image.\n\n### First example: using another pod\n\nCreate a `rclone.conf` with your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.\n\nIf you don't have `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`, you need to source your Pouta project and then use this command to create credentials:\n\n```sh\nopenstack ec2 credentials create\n```\n\nOnce created, create your `rclone.conf` file:\n\n```ini\n[default]\ntype = s3\nprovider = Other\nenv_auth = false\naccess_key_id = {ACCESS_KEY_ID}\nsecret_access_key = {SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\nendpoint = a3s.fi\nacl = private\n```\n\n_Replace `{ACCESS_KEY_ID}` and `{SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}` by your own credentilas._\n\nCreate a `rclone.sh` script:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh -e\n\nrclone copy \"/mnt/\" \"default:{BUCKET}\"\n\necho \"Done!\"\n```\n\n_Replace `{BUCKET}` by the target bucket where you want to backup your files._\n\nThen, you have to create your own custom `rclone` Docker image:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM rclone/rclone\n\nCOPY rclone.conf /.rclone.conf\nCOPY rclone.sh /usr/local/bin/\nRUN chmod 755 /.rclone.conf\nRUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rclone.sh\n```\nIf you create your image locally, don't forget to [push](../../rahti2/images/Using_Rahti_2_integrated_registry.md) it to your project.  \n\nOnce all this done, you can deploy your `rclone` pod.\nYou can use this example:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: rclone\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: copys3\n    image: <your_rclone_image>\n    command: [\"/usr/local/bin/rclone.sh\"]\n    resources:\n      limits:\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\n        cpu: \"500m\"\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: vol-to-backup\n      mountPath: /mnt/\n  volumes:\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a storage solution that provides backup services for data stored in Rahti 2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 2 is a cloud service that supports various operations, including data storage and backup solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGINX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NGINX is a web server used in this context as part of a deployment to demonstrate backing up content to Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage, used here to copy content from a PersistentVolumeClaim to Allas)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>RAHTI 2<|>Allas provides backup services for data stored in Rahti 2<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGINX<|>RAHTI 2<|>NGINX deployment is used as an example within Rahti 2 to demonstrate backup capabilities<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RCLONE<|>ALLAS<|>Rclone is used to copy content from Rahti 2 to Allas for backup purposes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RCLONE<|>NGINX<|>Rclone copies content from an NGINX deployment in Rahti 2 to Allas<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
