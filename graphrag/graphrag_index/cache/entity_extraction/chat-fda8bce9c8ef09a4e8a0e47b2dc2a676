The \"normal\" Lustre-based\nproject-specific directories *scratch* and *projappl* can store large amounts\nof data and are accessible to all nodes of Puhti. However, these directories\nare\n[inefficient for managing thousands of files](../../computing/running/throughput.md#inputoutput-efficiency).\n\nGenerally, you should avoid workflows that require creating large amounts of\nsmall files. If you anyhow need to work with thousands of files, you should\nconsider using the NVMe-based temporary local disk areas, either through normal\nor interactive batch jobs. The local scratch area is node-specific and visible\nonly to the batch job that requests it. After the job ends, the local scratch\nis purged. Because of this, you need to always first import your dataset to the\nlocal disk, and when you finish, copy the data you want to preserve back to\nsome more permanent storage place such as scratch or Allas.\n\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of the local scratch area, let's study a sample\ndirectory called `big_data`. The directory contains about 100 GB of data in\n120 000 files. Initially, the data is packaged as a single tar archive in the\nscratch directory of project 2001234 (`/scratch/project_2001234/big_data.tar`)\n\nFirst, we launch an interactive batch job with 2 cores, 4000 MB of memory and\n250 GB of fast local temporary disk space.\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --cores 2 --mem 4000 --tmp 250\n```\n\nThe analysis is then done in three steps:\n\n1. Move to the local scratch area using the environment variable\n   `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` and extract the tar package:\n   ```bash\n   cd $LOCAL_SCRATCH\n   tar xf /scratch/project_2001234/big_data.tar\n   ```\n\n2. Run the analysis. This time we run a `for` loop that uses a command\n   `transeq` to translate all fasta files found in the `big_data` directory\n   into new protein sequence files:\n   ```bash\n   for ffile in $(find ./ | grep fasta)\n   do\n       transeq ${ffile} ${ffile}.pep\n   done \n   ```\n   In this example, about 52 000 fasta files were found. Thus, after the\n   processing, the `big_data` directory now contains 52 000 more small files.\n   The actual translation is a computationally light task, so most time is used\n   just to open and close files (I/O).\n\n3. When the processing is finished, we store the results back to the scratch\n   directory as a new tar file:\n   ```bash\n   tar cf /scratch/project_2001234/big_data.pep.tar ./\n   ```\n   Now the results are safe in one file on scratch, and we can exit the\n   interactive session.\n\nThe same analysis procedure could be done in the scratch directory too.\nHowever, it is slow and may degrade the performance of the shared file system\nfor all users. To demonstrate the difference, below is an execution time\ncomparison for running the three steps above in `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` and in a\nregular Lustre-based scratch directory. The response times of `$LOCAL_SCRATCH`\nare rather stable, but in the scratch directory the execution times will vary\na lot based on the current total load on the Lustre file system.\n\n| Step                    | `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` | `/scratch` |\n|-------------------------|-----------------:|-----------:|\n|1.
