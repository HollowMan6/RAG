Note\nthat if you forget the password of your encrypted file, there is no one\nwho can open the file!\n\n## Managing access permissions of files and directories\n\nHundreds of users use the computing and storage environments of CSC. To\nkeep the files private and in order, each file and folder in the Linux\nenvironment of CSC is owned by a certain user account. In Linux systems\neach file has three user categories: *owner*, *group* and *others*. For\neach or these user categories, there are three access settings:\n*reading*, *writing* and *execution* permissions.\n\nBy default, only the owner of the file can read and modify (i.e. write)\nthe files and directories they have created.\nOther users do not have any access permissions to the files. Normally,\nthis setting is good as it keeps your data private. However, if you wish\nto share some data or execute self-written programs, the access\npermissions need to be modified.\n\nNote that the project specific-disk areas in Puhti and Mahti supercomputers \nare an exception to this rule.̣ There by default also other project members, \nbelonging to the same UNIX group, have full rights to files created by other \nusers.\n\nYou can check the access permissions with the command `ls -l`. Let's take\na look at the sample file listing that was previously used in the\n[`ls -la` example](using-linux-in-command-line.md#basic-commands-for-using-directories).\nIn this file listing the characters from second to the\ntenth column include the information on the access permissions.\n\nThe first three of these permission characters display the permissions of\nthe *owner*, next three ones display the access permissions of the\n*UNIX group members* and the last three characters *all the other\nusers*. Below is a sample output for `ls -la` command:\n\n    total 26914\n    drwx------+  3 kkayttaj csc       10 Dec 22 09:12 .\n    drwxr-xr-x  20 root     root       0 Dec 22 09:12 ..\n    drwx------+ 42 kkayttaj csc      472 Dec 22 09:07 ..\n    -rwxr-x---+  1 kkayttaj csc     1648 Dec 22 09:01 .cshrc\n    -rw-------+  1 kkayttaj csc       93 Dec 22 09:01 .my.cnf\n    -rw-------+  1 kkayttaj csc       48 Dec 22 09:05 Test.txt\n    -rw-------+  1 kkayttaj csc   878849 Jan 19  2009 input.table\n    drwxr-xr-x+  2 kkayttaj csc        2 Dec 22 09:11 project1\n    -rw-------+  1 kkayttaj csc 26432051 Dec 22 09:08 results.out\n    -rw-------+  1 kkayttaj csc       25 Mar 27  2009 sample.data\n    -rw-------+  1 kkayttaj csc       49 Mar 27  2009 test.txt \n\nIn the case of file `Test.txt` the setting is: `rw-------`. This means\nthat the owner of the file (`kkayttaj`) has permission to read (`r`)\nand write (`w`) to the file. Other users have no permissions for\nthis file. In the case of file `.cshrc` the definition is: `rwxr-x---`.\nIn this case the owner has also execution permissions (`x`) to the file\nand also the other users that belong to group `csc` have permission to\nread (`r`) and execute (`x`) the file.  \n\n### Managing access permissions using the command-line\n\nIn command-line usage, access permissions can be modified with command\n**chmod**. This command needs two arguments:\n\n1. a string that defines what changes are to be done and \n2. an argument that defines the target file or directory\n\nAs the first argument, you first define the\nuser category: `u` (user i.e. owner), `g` (group) or, `o`\n(others). Then you define with plus or minus character if you are going\nto add (`+`) or remove (`-`) permissions. Finally, you define, what\npermissions are added or removed. For example, to allow all the group\nmembers to read file `Test.txt` you should give the command:\n\n```bash\nchmod g+r Test.txt\n```\n\nYou can check the effect with `ls -l` command:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -l Test.txt\n-rw-r-----+  1 kkayttaj csc       48 Dec 22 09:05 Test.txt \n```\n\nYou can define several user categories and permissions at the same time.\nFor example,\n\n```bash\nchmod go+rwx Test.txt\n```\n\nwould add all access permissions for all users to file `Test.txt`. To\nremove the permissions, you should change the `+` character to `-`.\n\n```bash\nchmod go-rwx Test.txt\n```\n\nNote that by default, changing the permissions of a directory does not\nchange the permissions of the files and subdirectories in the target\ndirectory. Thus, the command\n\n```bash\nchmod g+w project1\n```\n\nwould not allow other group members to modify the files in directory\n`project1`. You can use option `-R` to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
