CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd. has these licenses available on CSC's server platforms. The licenses are only for academic use. See about use limitations from link given below (Ansys Academic - Terms and Conditions), and there, LICENSING AND TERM OF USE.\n\nANSYS products can be used also commercially on all CSC's platforms mentioned below. This is possible by using a \"pay-per-use\" licensing system called [Ansys Elastic Currency (AEC)](https://www.ansys.com/it-solutions/licensing). Usage of AEC licensing method on CSC's platforms always requires a private installation of ANSYS products by the user, and therefore does not follow the usage instructions given below. If you want to use AEC licensing, please send an inquiry to [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\n## Available\n\nCSC's AAESS product licenses are available on CSC's computing platforms [Puhti, Mahti and LUMI](../computing/available-systems.md) for analysis runs only. Additionally, on Mahti and LUMI, only CFD modules (Fluent and CFX) are available.  Latest AAESS products will be available on the servers, and installation of earlier versions is also possible. All installed versions are maintained on the servers.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter login on the server, make sure that you have transferred all your input files for the analysis run from your local computer to the server. Locate the files in your project's scratch directory. Home directory is not intended for computing.\n\nTo find out which versions of ANSYS are installed on the server, give command\n\n```bash\nmodule spider ansys\n```\n\nOn LUMI, you need to first load the module environment\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule spider ansys\n```\n\nFor example to load Ansys version 2023R2, give command\n\n```bash\nmodule load ansys/2023R2\n```\n\nThere are examples of **batch job files** available on the servers. On Mahti and LUMI, only for CFD computations:\n\n* Ansys CFX: `/appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_batch_job_files/parjob_cfx`\n* Ansys Fluent: `/appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_batch_job_files/parjob_fluent`\n* Ansys Fluent (LUMI): `/pfs/lustrep3/appl/local/csc/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_batch_job_files/parjob_fluent`\n* Ansys Structural: `/appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_batch_job_files/parjob_struct  (only on Puhti)`\n\nCopy those files and modify them for your own use. Further instructions are given in the files.\n\nAnsys Fluent input files for the example batch job are in the folder (Mahti and Puhti):\n\n```bash\n/appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_case_files/aircraft_wing/\n```\n\nand on LUMI\n\n```bash\n/pfs/lustrep3/appl/local/csc/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_case_file/aircraft_wing/\n```\n\nNotice.  Ansys Structural modules are available only on Puhti server.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter issues, please [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\n## More information\n\n* [Ansys Inc.](https://www.ansys.com/)\n* [Ansys Academic - Terms and Conditions](https://www.ansys.com/academic/terms-and-conditions)\n* [Ansys Academic product reference table](https://www.ansys.com/content/dam/web/academic/academic-product-reference-table.pdf)\n* [Ansys Elastic Currency (AEC) licensing](https://www.ansys.com/it-solutions/licensing)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANSYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ANSYS offers a comprehensive software suite for engineering simulation across a range of physics, used globally in academia and industry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AAESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ANSYS Academic engineering simulation software, used by universities worldwide for education and research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization that provides ANSYS licenses on its server platforms for academic use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>One of CSC's computing platforms where AAESS product licenses are available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>One of CSC's computing platforms where AAESS product licenses are available, specifically for CFD modules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>One of CSC's computing platforms where AAESS product licenses are available, specifically for CFD modules)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AAESS<|>ANSYS<|>AAESS is a product suite offered by ANSYS for academic purposes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD.<|>AAESS<|>CSC provides licenses for AAESS on its computing platforms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>AAESS<|>AAESS licenses are available on Puhti for analysis runs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>AAESS<|>AAESS licenses, specifically CFD modules, are available on Mahti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>AAESS<|>AAESS licenses, specifically CFD modules, are available on LUMI<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
