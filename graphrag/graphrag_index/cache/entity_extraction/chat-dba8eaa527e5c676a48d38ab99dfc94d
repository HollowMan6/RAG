These storage areas are however not intended for storing data that is not actively used. For example in the _scratch_ area of Puhti the un-used files are automatically removed after 180 days. \n\nOne of the main use cases of Allas is to store data while it is not actively used in the CSC supercomputers. When you start\nworking, you stage in the data from Allas. And when the data is no longer actively used, it can be staged out to Allas. \n\nIn CSC supercomputers, connection to Allas can be established with commands:\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf\n```\nAfter that you can:\n\n**List the data buckets and objects in Allas:** For listing we recommend [a-list](./a_commands.md#a-list).\n```text\na-list\n```\nThe command above lists available data buckets in Allas. To list data objects in a bucket give command:\n```text\na-list bucket_name\n```\nalternatively you can use [rclone](./rclone.md) commands:\n```text\nrclone lsd allas:\nrclone ls allas:bucket_name\n```\n**Copy data from Allas to a supercomputer (Puhti or Mahti) (stage in):** For downloading we recommend [a-get](./a_commands.md#a-get-retrieves-stored-data) \n```text\na-get bucket/object_name\n```\nor [rclone copy](./rclone.md):\n```text\nrclone copy allas:bucket/object_name ./\n```\n\n**Copy data from a Supercomputer to Allas (stage out):** For uploading we recommend [a-put](./a_commands.md#a-put-uploads-data-to-allas) \n```text\na-put filename\n```\nor [rclone copy](./rclone.md):\n```test\nrclone copy file.dat allas:/bucket_name \n```\n\n!!! note\n    Both a-put/a-get and rclone use Swift protocol on Allas. It is important not to mix Swift and S3, as these protocols are not fully mutually compatible.\n\n## Sharing data\n\nSharing data, e.g. datasets or research results, is easy in the object storage. You can share these either with a limited audience, e.g. other projects, or allow access for everybody by making the data public.\n\nThe data can be accessed and shared in a variety of ways:\n\n* **Private â€“ default:** By default, if you do not specify anything else, the contents of buckets can only be accessed by authenticated members of your project. **Private**/**Public** settings can be managed with:\n\n    * [swift client](./swift_client.md#giving-another-project-read-and-write-access-to-a-bucket) Use this for buckets created/used by `a-put/a-get` or `rclone`.\n    * [Web client](./web_client.md#view-objects-via-the-internet)\n    * [S3 client](./s3_client.md#s3cmd-and-public-objects)\n\n* **Access control lists:** Access control lists (ACLs) work on buckets, not objects. With ACLs, you can share your data in a limited manner to other projects. You can e.g. grant a collaboration project authenticated read access to your datasets.\n\n * **Temporary signed links** can be created with [s3cmd](./s3_client.md#publishing-objects-temporarily-with-signed-urls) . This kind of links can be used in cases where the data needs to be accessed over the internet without credentials, but is not supposed to remain publicly accessible.\n \n * **Public:** You can also have ACLs granting public read access to data, which is useful e.g. for permanently sharing public scientific results or public datasets.\n\n## Static web content\n\nA common way to use the object storage is storing static web content, such as images, videos, audio, pdfs or other downloadable content, and adding links to it on a web page, which can run either inside Allas or somewhere else, [like this example](https://a3s.fi/my_fishbucket/my_fish).\n\nUploading data to Allas can be done with any of the following clients: [web client](./web_client.md#upload-an-object), [a-commands](./a_commands.md#a-put-uploads-data-to-allas),[rclone](./rclone.md#create-buckets-and-upload-objects), [Swift](./swift_client.md#create-buckets-and-upload-objects) or [S3](./s3_client.md#create-buckets-and-upload-objects).\n\n## Storing data for distributed use\n\nThere are several cases where you need to access data in several locations. In these cases, the practice of staging in the data to individual servers or computers from the object storage can be used instead of a shared file storage.\n\n## Accessing the same data via multiple CSC platforms\n\nSince the data in the object storage is available anywhere, you can access the data via both the CSC clusters and cloud services. This makes the object storage a good place to store data as well as intermediate and final results in cases where the workflow requires the use of e.g. both Allas and Puhti.\n\n## Collecting data from different sources\n\nIt is easy to push data to the object storage from several different sources. This data can then later be processed as needed.\n\nFor example, several data collectors may push data to be processed, e.g. scientific instruments, meters, or software that harvests social media streams for scientific analysis. They can push their data into the object storage, and later virtual machines and computing jobs on Puhti can process the data.\n \n## Self-service backups of data\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
