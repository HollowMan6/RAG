Promote users\n\nOnce the co-instructors/co-organizers/collaborators have signed in, you can find their name in the `members` tab (under `manage workspaces`), to give them rights to change things and see other participants sessions, `promote to co-owner` from the Menu column next to the members name.\nCo-owners can do everything the owner can, except demoting the owner or deleting the workspace. For collaboration purposes, all collaborators should have co-owner rights, to be able to write to the shared folder in the workspace.\n\n## Creating custom Docker images\nIf you cannot find a suitable image for your intended application, you will need to create and publish your own custom image for Noppe. Image can be created on your own computer or for example [cPouta](../pouta/index.md) instance.\n\nRequirements: \n\n* A computer to create the Docker image, it should have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. In general Linux/Mac computer is recommended. In Windows likely admin rights are needed and using Docker might be challenging.\n* A place to upload the Docker image, for example DockerHub or Quay.io. \n\nSteps to create your own custom Docker image:\n\n### Create a Dockerfile  \n   \nDockerfile contains a set of instructions to build a docker image. If unfamiliar with Dockerfile, see for example [Docker 101](https://www.paigeniedringhaus.com/blog/docker-101-fundamentals-the-dockerfile) and [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).\n   \n#### Jupyter notebook example\nFor JupyterLab with some conda packages use the following as minimal example:\n\n ``` \n # use jupyter minimal notebook as base for your image\n # it has eg conda already installed\n FROM jupyter/minimal-notebook\n\n #some first setup steps need to be run as root user\n USER root\n\n # set home environment variable to point to user directory\n ENV HOME /home/$NB_USER\n\n # install needed extra tools, eg ssh-client and less\n RUN apt-get update \\\n     && apt-get install -y ssh-client less \\\n     && apt-get clean\n\n # the user set here will be the user that students will use \n USER $NB_USER\n\n ### Installing the needed conda packages and jupyter lab extensions. \n # Run conda clean afterwards in same layer to keep image size lower\n RUN conda install --yes -c conda-forge <your-packages-here> \\\n   && conda clean -afy\n\n ```\n\nFor other package management systems, adjust the last `RUN` command accordingly. Make sure the package management system is available in `jupyter/minimal-notebook` base image or install it yourself (same way as ssh-client and less are installed in above example).\n    \n#### RStudio example\n    \nTo build custom R images, you do not need to start from scratch. Many pre-built R images are already available in docker registries. Especially, the [rocker project](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) contains a large set of images with various configurations provided in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/). You can therefore start with one of these pre-existing images. \n\nFor adding packages or configurations you can use [scripts provided by Rocker on their github page](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/tree/master/scripts), edit them or write your own from scratch and copy them into the docker file system. These scripts usually contain system dependencies and required packages for your needs.\n\nFor RStudio with some packages, use the following Dockerfile as minimum example:\n\n```bash\n# Use Rocker RStudio as base for your image\nFROM rocker/rstudio\n\n# copy the desired installation script into docker file system, make sure that you have execute rights to the script\nCOPY install_xx.sh /rocker_scripts/\n\n# install the custom packages and system dependencies by running the script\nRUN /rocker_scripts/install_xx.sh\n```\n  \nBelow a few useful commands to install R packages from the command line or script, which can be used to write your own install script or edit the scripts provided by rocker:\n\n```bash\n# install a package with install2.r script\ninstall2.r --error --deps TRUE packagename  \n# Install R packages from CRAN\nR -e \"install.packages('packagename', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')\" \n# Install R packages from Github using package managers like devtools and BiocManager. \nR --no-restore --no-save -e 'packagemanager::install_github(\"packagename\",dependencies=TRUE)'\n# Install R packages while specifying a specific version\nR --no-restore --no-save -e 'packagemanager::install_version(\"packagename\", version=\"version\")'\n# Script execution\nR -e \"source('/path/of/myscript.R')\"  \n```\n\n### Build the image and test it \n\n* Build the image from dockerfile to current directory `.`\n\n```\ndocker build -t \"<yourimagename>\" -f <yourimagename>.dockerfile .\n```\n\nNote that with Mac, or on any ARM host, you need to tell docker to build x64 images so that they are compatible\nwith our cloud hosts. This can be done using \"docker buildx\".\n\n```\ndocker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 ....\n```\n\nAnother alternative is to build the image on an x64 VM, for example on pouta.csc.fi.\n\n* Test your image. \n    * `-p 8888:8787` means bind Docker port 8787 to host port 8888.\n    * If using cP\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
