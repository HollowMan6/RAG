Invoking these\ncompilers is done through the `ftn`, `cc` and `CC` [compilers\nwrappers][wrappers].\n\n[wrappers]: ../../development/compiling/prgenv.md#compiler-wrappers\n\n## Choose a version\n\nThe GNU Compiler Collection is available from the `PrgEnv-gnu` module. This\nmodule loads the default version of the compiler.\n\n```bash\n$ module load PrgEnv-gnu\n```\n\nIf you wish to use an older or newer version, you can list the available\nversion with\n\n```bash\n$ module avail gcc\n```\n\nand then switch to the desired version using\n\n```bash\n$ module swap gcc gcc/<version>\n```\n\nAs of April 2022, GCC versions 9.3.0, 10.3.0, and 11.2.0 are available on LUMI.\nWe recommend using GCC 11, if possible, because it can optimize code\nspecifically for the Zen 3 processors in LUMI (with the `craype-x86-milan`\nmodule or the compiler flag `-march=znver3`). GCC 9 and 10 can only optimize\nfor Zen 2 processors.\nThe performance difference is quite small, though (on average ca 1%, according to e.g.\n[these tests from Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd-znver3-gcc11&num=1)).\n\n## OpenMP Support\n\nOpenMP is turned off by default. You can turn it on using the `-fopenmp` flag.\n\n## Optimization options\n\n:material-help-circle-outline: `man gcc` - `man gfortran`\n\nThe default optimization level of the GNU compiler is `-O0`. It is therefore\nnecessary to add additional optimization flags. A good starting point is\n\n```bash\n-O2 -ftree-vectorize -funroll-loops -ffast-math\n```\n\n- the `-O2` option performs nearly all supported optimizations\n- the `-ffast-math` relax the IEEE specifications for math functions. This option\n  can produce incorrect results, don't use this flag if your code is sensitive \n  to floating-point optimizations.\n- the `-funroll-loops` option allows the compiler to unroll loops\n\nA more aggressive option might be\n\n```bash\n-O3 -funroll-loops\n```\n\nor for even more aggressive optimization\n\n```bash\n-Ofast -funroll-loops\n```\n\nThe `-Ofast` enables all `-O3` optimizations and disregards strict standards\ncompliance.\n\n- [GCC documentation about optimization options][gcc-opt]\n\n## Legacy Fortran codes\n\nIt is common to experience problems when compiling older Fortran codes with GCC\n10 and newer versions. Typically, these codes are not fully compliant with the\nFortran standard. The most common error message is `Error: Type mismatch ...`\nin connection with MPI calls. In those cases, a less strict compiler mode can\nbe activated with the extra flags:\n\n```bash\n-fallow-argument-mismatch\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n-std=legacy\n```\n\n## Compiler Feedback\n\nInformation about the optimizations and transformations performed by the\ncompiler can be obtained using the `-fopt-info` option.\n\n- [GCC documentation about developer options][gcc-dev]\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo ease a debugging process, it is useful to generate an executable containing\ndebugging information. For this purpose, you can use the `-g` option.\n\nMost of the time, the debug information works best at low levels of code\noptimization, so consider using the `-O0` level. The `-g` options can be\nspecified on a per-file basis so that only a small part of your application\nincurs the debugging penalty.\n\n- [GCC documentation about debug options][gcc-debug]\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GNU COMPILER COLLECTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, and Fortran programming languages and provides various compiler options and optimizations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRGENV-GNU MODULE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Module that loads the default version of the GNU Compiler Collection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>A location where GCC versions 9.3.0, 10.3.0, and 11.2.0 are available as of April 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenMP support in GCC is turned off by default and can be enabled with the -fopenmp flag)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCC DOCUMENTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides detailed information about optimization options, developer options, and debug options for GCC)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GNU COMPILER COLLECTION<|>PRGENV-GNU MODULE<|>The PrgEnv-gnu module is used to load the GNU Compiler Collection<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GNU COMPILER COLLECTION<|>LUMI<|>GCC versions are available on LUMI, recommending version 11 for Zen 3 processors optimization<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GNU COMPILER COLLECTION<|>OPENMP<|>GCC has optional support for OpenMP, which is disabled by default<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GNU COMPILER COLLECTION<|>GCC DOCUMENTATION<|>GCC documentation provides comprehensive details on using and optimizing GCC<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
