See the [data storage options][data-storage-options] page for an\noverview of where to store your data on LUMI.\n\n## Copying files with `scp`\n\nCopying files between different UNIX-like systems can be done with the `scp`\ncommand. This command, which stands for *Secure Copy Protocol*, allows you to\ntransfer files between a local host and a remote host or between two remote\nhosts. The basic syntax of the `scp` command is the following:\n\n```bash\nscp <origin-path> <destination-path>\nscp <origin-path> [user@]host:<destination-path>\nscp [user@]host:<origin-path> <destination-path>\n```\n\nwhere `<origin-path>` is the path to the file you want to copy to the \ndestination defined by `<destination-path>`.\n\nTo copy a file from a local machine to LUMI, on the local machine run (with\n`<username>` replaced by your username):\n\n```bash\nscp /path/to/file <username>@lumi.csc.fi:/path/to/destination/on/lumi\n```\n\nand, correspondingly, to copy files from LUMI to a local machine, on the local\nmachine run:\n\n```bash\nscp <username>@lumi.csc.fi:/path/to/file/on/lumi /path/to/local/destination\n```\n\nYou may use the `-r` switch to recursively copy an entire directory, e.g.\n\n```bash\nscp -r <username>@lumi.csc.fi:/path/to/directory/on/lumi /path/to/local/destination\n```\n\nAlso, if `scp` does not automatically find your private SSH key, you need to specify it manually using the `-i` switch:\n\n```bash\nscp -i <path-to-private-key> <username>@lumi.csc.fi:/path/to/file/on/lumi /path/to/local/destination\n```\n\n## Copying files with `rsync`\n\nThe `rsync` tool, which stands for *Remote Sync*, is a remote and local file\nsynchronization tool. It has the advantage of minimizing the amount of data\ncopied by only copying files that have changed. The advantages over `scp` are\n\n- It allows for synchronization. `scp` always copies and transfers everything,\n  while `rsync` will only copy and transfer files that have changed.\n- Better for the transfer of large files as `rsync` can save progress.\n  If the transfer is interrupted it can be resumed from the point of interruption.\n\nThe basic syntax of the `rsync` command is the following:\n\n```bash\nrsync <options> <origin-path> <destination-path>\nrsync <options> <origin-path> [user@]host:<destination-path>\nrsync <options> [user@]host:<origin-path> <destination-path>\n```\n\nBelow are some useful options to use with `rsync`:\n\n- archive mode with the `-a` or `--archive` option. This option tells `rsync`\n  to syncs directories recursively, transfer special and block devices,\n  preserve symbolic links, access permissions and time stamps\n- compresses the data with the `-z` or `--compress` option. With this option\n  `rsync` will compress the data as it is sent to the destination machine.\n- to keep the partially transferred files, use the `--partial` option. It is\n  useful when transferring large files over slow or unstable network\n  connections.\n- if your goal is to achieve mirroring use the `--delete` option. When this\n  option is used, `rsync` deletes extraneous files from the destination\n  location.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a computing facility or platform where users can store and transfer data using scp and rsync tools)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Secure Copy Protocol, a command for transferring files between hosts on a network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSYNC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Remote Sync, a tool for synchronizing files between hosts on a network, with features for minimizing data transfer by only copying changed files)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCP<|>LUMI<|>SCP is used for transferring files to and from LUMI<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSYNC<|>LUMI<|>RSYNC is recommended for synchronizing files with LUMI, especially for large files or directories<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
