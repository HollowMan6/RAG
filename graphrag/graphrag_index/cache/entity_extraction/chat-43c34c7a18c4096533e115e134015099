As the GPU is by far the biggest energy user it\nprovides a good approximation of the total energy usage.\n\n### Tools for monitoring GPU energy usage\n\n#### `seff` command for a completed job (Puhti and Mahti)\n\nOn Puhti and Mahti you can use the `seff` tool for a completed job:\n\n```bash\nseff <job_id>\n```\n\nNote that the GPU energy usage is counted only after the job has\ncompleted, so there is no intermediate value printed while it's\nrunning.\n\nExample output where we have used a single node with 4 GPUs:\n\n```\nGPU energy\n      Hostname        GPU Id   Energy (Wh)\n        r01g01             0         58.30\n        r01g01             1         56.63\n        r01g01             2         44.87\n        r01g01             3         62.21\n```\n\n\n### `gpu-energy` tool (LUMI)\n\nLUMI does not have the `seff` command, but there is a preliminary tool\nthat can be used to read the GPU energy counters found in the AMD GPU\ncard. The tool and its documentation can be found here:\n<https://github.com/mvsjober/gpu-energy-amd>.\n\nIt has been pre-installed on LUMI in the path `/appl/local/csc/soft/ai/bin/gpu-energy`.\n\nTypical usage in a Slurm script:\n\n```\ngpu-energy --save\n\n# run job here\n\ngpu-energy --diff\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```\nGPU 0: 46.64 Wh, avg power: 377.81 W (444.43 s)\nGPU 2: 46.47 Wh, avg power: 376.46 W (444.43 s)\nGPU 4: 46.18 Wh, avg power: 374.04 W (444.43 s)\nGPU 6: 46.62 Wh, avg power: 377.62 W (444.43 s)\nTOTAL: 185.91 Wh\n```\n\nNote that it prints the energy only for even-numbered GCDs, this is because the AMD GPU energy counter only produces a single value for the whole MI250x card.\n\n!!! warning \"Always measure GPU usage for a full node on LUMI!\"\n\n    Measuring the GPU energy on LUMI has to be done on a full node to get\n    accurate results. The reason is that the MI250x GPU has 2 GPU dies\n    (GCDs), but the energy counter gives a single number for the whole\n    MI250x. If you reserve a single GCD, another run may be using the\n    other GCD. Reserving 2 GCDs, it's not possible to guarantee that you\n    get them from the same card.\n\nSee the [README.md file for more usage examples](https://github.com/mvsjober/gpu-energy-amd/blob/master/README.md).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
