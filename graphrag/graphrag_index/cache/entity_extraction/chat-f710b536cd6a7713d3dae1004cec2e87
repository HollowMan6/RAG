Rclone can now refer to this connection with remote name `s3allas:`.\nIn the examples below the swift based `allas:` remote definition is used, but if you have S3 connection defined, you could replace it\nwith `s3allas:`. Note that you can have both `allas:` and `s3allas:` functional in the same time and that they can still use different Allas projects. However, you should avoid mixing protocols. If an object is loaded using `allas:` do also all operations with `allas:`.  \n\n## Create buckets and upload objects\n\nThe data in Allas is arranged into containers called buckets. You can consider them as root-level directories. All buckets in Allas must have unique names â€“ you cannot create a bucket if some other project has already used that bucket name. It is a good rule of thumb to have something project- or user-specific in the bucket name, e.g. _2000620-raw-data_. See the [checklist](../introduction.md#naming-buckets) for how to name a bucket.\n\nIn the case of _Rclone_, create a bucket:\n```text\nrclone mkdir allas:2000620-raw-data\n```\nUpload a file using the command ```rclone copy```:\n```text\nrclone copy file.dat allas:2000620-raw-data/\n```\nThe command above creates an object _file.dat_ in the bucket _2000620-raw-data_.\nIf you use `rclone move` instead of `rclone copy`, the local version of the uploaded file (file.dat)\nis deleted after copying.\n\nThe _copy_ and _move_ subcommands only work with files. If you would like to copy all files in a directory, use the _copyto_ or _moveto_ subcommands.\n\nDuring upload, files that are larger than 5 GB will be split and stored as several objects. The objects are stored automatically in a distinct bucket called `<bucket-name>_segments`. For example, if you would upload a large file to  `2000620-raw-data`, the actual data would be stored in several pieces in the bucket `2000620-raw-data_segments`. The target bucket (`2000620-raw-data`) would contain just a manifest object stating which segments comprise the stored file. Operations performed on the manifest object are automatically reflected in the segments. Normally users don't need to operate with the segments buckets at all, and objects inside these buckets should not be deleted or modified.\n\n## List buckets and objects\n\nList all the buckets belonging to a project:\n<pre><b>rclone lsd allas:</b>\n0 2019-06-06 14:43:40         0 2000620-raw-data\n</pre>\n\nList the content of a bucket: \n<pre><b>rclone ls allas:2000620-raw-data</b>\n677972 file.dat\n</pre>\n\n## Download objects\n\nUse the same `rclone copy` and `rclone copyto` commands to download a file:\n```text\nrclone copy allas:2000620-raw-data/file.dat\n```\n\nIf you include a destination parameter in the download command, Rclone creates a directory for the download:\n```text\nrclone copy allas:2000620-raw-data/file.dat doh\n```\n\n<pre><b>ls doh</b>\nfile.dat</pre>\n\n<pre><b>ls -ld doh</b>\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 user  staff  96 Jun  6 14:58 doh\n</pre>\n\n## Synchronizing a directory\n\nOne way of moving data between Allas and the computing environment is synchronization. The difference between copying and synchronizing is that while copying only adds new objects or files from the source to the destination, synchronization can also remove data from the destination, in order to make the destination match the source. This feature makes synchronization very effective but also potentially very dangerous.\n\nFor example, a folder named _mydata_ has the following structure:\n<pre>\n<b>ls -R mydata</b>\n\nmydata/:\nfile1.txt  setA  setB\n\nmydata/setA:\nfile2.txt\n\nmydata/setB:\nfile3.txt  file4.txt\n</pre>\n\nAn example of using _sync_ (note that the destination parameter requires the folder name (_mydata_)):\n\n```text\nrclone sync mydata allas:2000620-raw-data/mydata\n```\n\n<pre><b>rclone ls allas:2000620-raw-data</b>\n   677972 mydata/file1.txt\n    10927 mydata/setA/file2.txt\n     1116 mydata/setB/file3.txt\n     5075 mydata/setB/file4.txt\n</pre>\n\nLet us assume that we are storing new data (_file5.txt_ and _file6.txt_) in the subdirectory _mydata/setC_ and simultaneously removing the file _mydata/setB/file3.txt_. When the _rclone sync_ command is executed again, the new data is added to Allas and the object _mydata/setB/file3.txt_ is removed.\n\n<pre><b>rclone sync mydata allas:2000620-raw-data/mydata</b>\n\n<b>rclone ls allas:2000620-raw-data</b>\n   677972 mydata/file1.txt\n    10927 mydata/setA/file2.txt\n     5075 mydata/setB/file4.txt\n     1265 mydata/setC/file5.txt\n     4327 mydata/setC/file6.txt\n</pre\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
