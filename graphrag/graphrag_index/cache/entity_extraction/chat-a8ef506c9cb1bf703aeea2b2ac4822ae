You *need* to pick a **unique name** that is not in use by any other project\nin the system.\n1. You *can* also enter a **human-readable display name** and.\n1. You *have to* also enter a **CSC computing project** in the _Description_ field. It must be a currently valid CSC project, that your account has access to. In order to view to which CSC projects you have access to, please check <https://my.csc.fi>. If you have access to no CSC project, you will not be able to create any Rahti 1 project. If you have Rahti 1 access via project_1000123, you would enter the following in the Description field:\n\n> csc_project: 1000123\n\nYou can also enter other text in the\ndescription field if you want to have a human-readable description for\nthe project you are creating. In that case\nthe field could look like this:\n\n```yaml\nThis project is used for hosting the Pied Piper web application.\n\ncsc_project: 1000123\n```\n\nSee the section about [accounts](/accounts/).\n\nOnce you have filled in the fields, click **Create**, and you will see the application\ncatalog where you can pick an application template or import your\nown one.\n\nFor more information about using the web interface, refer to the\n[official OpenShift documentation](https://docs.okd.io/). You can find\nout which version of the documentation to look at in the web interface by\nclicking the question mark symbol in the top bar and selecting \"About\".\n\n### Extra information about CSC computing projects in Rahti 1\n\nProjects in OpenShift are separate from CSC computing projects. A single CSC\ncomputing project can have access to multiple projects in OpenShift.\nEach CSC computing project with access to Rahti 1 receives a *group* in\nOpenShift.\n\n!!! note\n    Rahti 1 can be used free of charge for open research and\n    education in Finnish universities and polytechnics.\n\nAny usage within OpenShifts projects are billed\nto the billing unit quota of the CSC project selected. Note that the selected CSC project must\nhave Rahti 1 access and the user creating a project must be a member of that computing project,\notherwise the OpenShift project creation will fail.\n\n* If you would like to know which CSC computing projects you are a member of, you\ncan view a list in the [My Projects\ntool](https://my.csc.fi/myProjects) of MyCSC. You can also set a default \nbilling project by going to [Your Profile page](https://my.csc.fi/myProfile). \nSelect the project you would like to have as your default billing project and\nclick on \"Save\". After doing this, the default billing project\nwill be selected as the billing project for OpenShift projects if you do not\nexplicitly specify one.\n\n* If you would like to know which CSC computing project an OpenShift project is\nassociated with, you can do so using the _oc_ command line tool. You can find\ninstructions for setting up oc in the [command line tool usage\ninstructions ](cli.md). For example, if your OpenShift project is called\n*my-openshift-project*, you would run:\n\n```bash\noc get project my-openshift-project -o yaml | grep csc_project\n```\n\nThis should produce the following output:\n\n```yaml\n    csc_project: \"1000123\"\n```\n\nIn this case, the project is `1000123`. Unfortunately, this information is not available via a web interface.\n\n!!! note\n    It is not possible for normal users to change the *csc_project* label\n    after a project has been created. If you would like to change the label for\n    an existing project, please [contact the support](/support/contact/). You can also create\n    a completely new project if you want to use a different label.\n\n!!! note\n    It is possible to change the description of a project, but **it will not** change the csc_project label.\n\n## Project quotas\n\nTwo kinds of quota are applied in OpenShift:\n\n* Total number of projects per user\n* Resources created inside a project\n\nBy default, users can create **up to five projects**. Each of them has its\nown quota for the following resources:\n\n| Resource                         | Default |\n|----------------------------------|---------|\n| Pods                             | 20      |\n| Virtual cores per pod            | 2       |\n| Virtual cores per container      | 2       |\n| RAM per pod                      | 8 GiB   |\n| RAM per container                | 8 GiB   |\n| Storage                          | 50 GiB  |\n| Number of image streams          | 10      |\n| Size of each registry images     | 5 GiB   |\n\nYou can find the resource usage and quota of a project in the project view in\nthe web interface under Resources -> Quota. Alternatively, you can use the oc\ncommand line tool:\n\n```bash\noc describe quota\noc describe limitranges\n```\n\nIf you need to create more projects or you need more resources in a project for\nyour application, you can apply for more quota by contacting the Rahti\nsupport. See the [Contact page](/support/contact/) for instructions. Quota requests are\nhandled on a case-by-case basis depending on the currently available resources\nin Rahti 1 and the use case.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
