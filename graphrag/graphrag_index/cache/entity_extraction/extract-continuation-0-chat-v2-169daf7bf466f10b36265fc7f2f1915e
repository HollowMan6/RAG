In those cases you can add option `-k` to the `allas-conf` command.\n```text\nallas-conf -k\n```\nWith this option on, the password is stored into environment variable OS_PASSWORD. A-commands recognize this environment variable and when executed, automatically refresh the current Allas connection.\n\n## Copying data between Puhti scratch directory and Allas\n\nCopying data from directory _/scratch/project_201234/dataset_3_ to Allas:\n\n```text\ncd /scratch/project_201234\na-put dataset_3\n```\nThe data in directory _dataset_3_ is stored to the default bucket _201234-puhti-SCRATCH_ as object: _dataset_3.tar_.\nAvailable data buckets in Allas can be listed with command:\n\n```text\na-list\n```\nAnd the content of 201234-puhti-SCRATCH can be listed with command:\n\n```\na-list 201234-puhti-SCRATCH\n```\nThe directory that was stored to Allas can be retrieved back to Puhti with command:\n\n```text\na-get 201234-puhti-SCRATCH/dataset_3.tar\n```\n\n\n# A commands in more detail\n\n## a-put uploads data to Allas<a name=\"a-put\"></a>\n\n`a-put` is used to upload data from the disk environment of Mahti and Puhti to \nthe Allas storage environment. The basic syntax of the command:\n```text\na-put directory_or_file\n```\n\nBy default, this tool performs the following operations:\n\n1.    Ensure that there is a working connection to the Allas storage service and \ndefine the project that will be used to store the data.\n\n2.    In the case of a directory, the content of the directory is collected as a single file\nusing the `tar` command.\n\n3.    The packed data is uploaded to Allas using the `rclone` command and the _Swift_ protocol.\n\n\nBy default, a-put uses the standard bucket and object names that depend on the username, project and location\nof the data uploaded:\n\n*    a) Data from /scratch in Puhti is uploaded to the bucket _projectNumber-puhti-SCRATCH_\n*    b) Data from /scratch in Mahti is uploaded to the bucket _projectNumber-mahti-SCRATCH_\n*    c) Data from /projappl in Puhti is uploaded to the bucket _projectNumber-puhti-PROJAPPL_ \n*    d) Data from /projappl in Mahti is uploaded to the bucket _projectNumber-mahti-PROJAPPL_ \n*    e) Data from $LOCAL_SCRATCH in Puhti is uploaded to the bucket _projectNumber-puhti-LOCAL_SCRATCH_\n*    f) In other cases, the data is uploaded to _username-projectNumber-MISC_\n\nFor example, for the user _kkayttaj_, a member of the project _12345_, data located in the HOME directory\nis uploaded to the bucket _kkayttaj-12345-MISC_.\n\nIf you wish to use other than the standard bucket, you can define a bucket name with the option _-b_ or  \n_--bucket_.\n\nThe compressed dataset is stored as one object. By default, the object name depends on the file name and location. The possible subdirectory path in Puhti or Mahti is included in the object name, e.g. a file called _test_1.txt_ in /scratch/project_2012345 in Puhti can be stored using the commands:\n```text\ncd /scratch/project_2012345\na-put test_1.txt\n```\n\nIn this case, the file is stored in the bucket _2012345-puhti-SCRATCH_.\nas the object _test_1.txt_\n\nIf you have another file called _test_1.txt_ located in _/scratch/project_2012345/kkayttaj/project2/_,\nyou can store it using the commands\n```text\ncd /scratch/project_2012345/kkayttaj/project2/\na-put test_1.txt\n```\nor\n```text\ncd /scratch/project_2012345/kkayttaj\na-put project2/test_1.txt\n```\nIn this case, the file is stored in the bucket _2012345-puhti-SCRATCH_ \nas the object _kkayttaj/project2/test_1.txt_.\n\nIn addition to the actual data object, another object containing metadata is created. This metadata object has the \nsame name as the main object with the extension *_ameta*. This metadata file is used by the \nother *a-commands*, and normally, it is not displayed to the user, but if you examine the buckets\nusing tools like _swift_ or _rclone_, you will see these metadata objects as well.\n\nIf you wish to use a name differing from the default object name, you can define it with the option _-o_ or  \n_--object_:\n```text\ncd /scratch/project_2012345\na-put project2/test_1.txt -b newbucket1 -o case1.txt -c\n```\n\nThe command above uploads the file *test_1.txt* to Allas in the bucket _newbucket1_ as the object _case1.txt.zst_.\nAs the option _-c_ is used, the data is stored in zstd compressed format. \n\nYou can give several file or directory names for _a-put_ and use * as a wildcard character when naming the data to be uploaded.
