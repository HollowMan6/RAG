It is provided as an alternative to email attachments, but it can\nalso be used for moving files to CSC environment. The service allows you to\nupload and send files up to 300 GB size. The service is **not** intended for\nlong-term storage, as the files are deleted automatically after the\npreservation time is exceeded. The maximum preservation time is 21 days.\n\nFunet FileSender is available for all Haka-enabled organizations without any\nadditional measures. For example, a CSC user account is not needed to use the\nservice. Both sending and receiving are possible without installing any\nadditional programs.\n\nYou can use Funet FileSender to share your files with anybody. The receiver\ndoesn't need any authentication for downloading the file from FileSender. If\nyou don't belong to Haka, you need a colleague who can send you an\n_upload voucher_. The voucher is a one-time permit to use the service for\nsending a file.\n\n## Uploading data to FileSender\n\nFirst, [login to the service with your browser](https://filesender.funet.fi).\nYou should login to the system with your Haka credentials; first select your\nhome organization and use your institutional username and password to log in\n(not CSC username and password).\n\nAfter this you can specify the email address of the recipient, or alternatively\nget a shareable link. Use the _Select files_ button to choose the files you\nwant to send. After the temporary storage time has been defined\n(_Expiry date:_) and the usage terms are accepted, press the _Send_ button to\nupload the files. Once the files have been uploaded, the recipient will get an\nemail notification.\n\nIt is possible to administer your files while they are waiting for the pick-up.\nClick the _My Transfers_ button to do this.\n\n![Funet FileSender upload page](/img/funet_upload.png 'Funet FileSender upload page')\n\n!!! Note\n    As data is uploaded to Funet FileSender through a web browser, it may be\n    difficult to use it for data located on CSC supercomputers. In this case,\n    you can alternatively use\n    [Allas commands](../Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md) `a-flip` or\n    `a-publish` for sharing data. Yet another alternative is to\n    [use the FileSender command-line client](#using-filesender-from-the-command-line).\n\n## Download data from FileSender\n\nThe recipient will get an email that contains a URL to the download page of\nthe submitted files. The shareable link will also point to the download page.\nYou can start the download by pressing the _Download_ button.\n\n![Funet FileSender download page](/img/funet_download.png)\n\nYou can also right click the download button and select _Copy Link_ to\nget the download URL to the file. The URL can then be used to download the file\nusing another tool, for example [`wget`](wget.md):\n\n```bash\nwget \"https://filesender.funet.fi/download.php?token=4da0-b98e-3290c6471469&files_ids=36805\" -O data_from_FS\n```\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    When downloading data from Funet FileSender with `wget` you must enclose\n    the download link with quotation marks and use option `-O` to define a file\n    name that will be used for the downloaded data.\n\n## Using FileSender from the command-line\n\nFileSender can also be used from the command-line using a Python 3 utility\nscript. These instructions have been adapted from the\n[AARNet Knowledge Base](https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/articles/5276533711887-Use-FileSender-from-the-command-line).\n\nAssuming you are on a Linux server (e.g. Puhti or Mahti):\n\n1. Download the `filesender.py` Python tool:\n\n    ```bash\n    wget \"https://filesender.aarnet.edu.au/clidownload.php\" -O filesender.py\n    ```\n\n2. Create a new folder `~/.filesender` in your home directory and download a\n   client configuration file there:\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p ~/.filesender\n    wget \"https://filesender.aarnet.edu.au/clidownload.php?config=1\" -O ~/.filesender/filesender.py.ini\n    ```\n\n3. Edit the `~/.filesender/filesender.py.ini` files as follows (decrease the\n   preservation time if needed):\n\n    ```ini\n    [system]\n    base_url = https://filesender.funet.fi/rest.php\n    default_transfer_days_valid = 21\n\n    [user]\n    username = <your username>\n    apikey = <api secret>\n    ```\n\n    Your username (_Identifiant_) and API key (_Secret_) can be found/generated\n    on the _My profile_ page of the\n    [Funet FileSender website](https://filesender.funet.fi/) (requires logging\n    in first). Treat the API key as any password – keep it secret! Note that\n    the username in this case is **not** the same as your CSC account username.\n\n4. Now you may send a file (e.g. `data.tgz`) to a recipient (e.g.\n   `recipient@example.com`) with:\n\n    ```bash\n    python3 filesender.py -r recipient@example.com data.tar.gz\n    ```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
