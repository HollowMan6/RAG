In particular MPI\nand Horovod are not expected to work anymore with these modules. If\nyou still wish to access these versions, you need to enable old RHEL7\nmodules by `module use /appl/soft/ai/rhel7/modulefiles/`.\n\nIf you find that some package is missing, you can often install it\nyourself using `pip install`. It is recommended to use Python virtual\nenvironments. See [our Python documentation for more information on\nhow to install packages\nyourself](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).\nIf you think that some important package should be included in the\nmodule provided by CSC, please [contact our\nservicedesk](../support/contact.md).\n\nAll modules are based on containers using Apptainer (previously known\nas Singularity). Wrapper scripts have been provided so that common\ncommands such as `python`, `python3`, `pip` and `pip3` should work as\nnormal. \n\nFor **PyTorch version 2.2 and earlier**, other commands need to be\nprefixed with `apptainer_wrapper exec`, for example `apptainer_wrapper\nexec huggingface-cli`. For more information, see [CSC's general\ninstructions on how to run Apptainer\ncontainers](../computing/containers/run-existing.md). \n\nFor **PyTorch version 2.3 and later on Puhti or Mahti**, we have used\nwrappers created with [the tykky\ntool](../computing/containers/tykky.md), and all commands provided by\npre-installed Python packages are wrapped and can be used directly. In\ncase you really need to run something inside the container you can\nprefix with `_debug_exec` or run `_debug_shell` to open a shell\nsession.\n\n\n!!! info \"New users\"\n\n    If you are new to using machine learning on CSC's supercomputers,\n    please read our new tutorial [Getting started with machine learning\n    at CSC](../support/tutorials/ml-starting.md), which covers how to run\n    a simple PyTorch project on Puhti using the web user interface.\n\n\n## License\n\nPyTorch is BSD-style licensed, as found in the [LICENSE\nfile](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the default version of PyTorch on Puhti or Mahti, initialize it\nwith:\n\n```text\nmodule load pytorch\n```\n\nTo access PyTorch on LUMI:\n\n```text\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles/\nmodule load pytorch\n```\n\nIf you wish to have a specific version ([see above for available\nversions](#available)), use:\n\n```text\nmodule load pytorch/2.4\n```\n\nPlease note that the module already includes CUDA and cuDNN libraries,\nso **there is no need to load cuda and cudnn modules separately!**\n\nThis command will also show all available versions:\n\n```text\nmodule avail pytorch\n```\n\nTo check the exact packages and versions included in the loaded module you can\nrun:\n\n```text\nlist-packages\n```\n\n\n!!! warning \n\n    Note that login nodes are not intended for heavy computing, please use slurm\n    batch jobs instead.
