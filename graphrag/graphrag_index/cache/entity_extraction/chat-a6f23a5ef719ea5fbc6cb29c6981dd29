This page provides instructions for three\npopular alternatives: [PowerShell](#powershell), [PuTTY](#putty) and\n[MobaXterm](#mobaxterm).\n\n## PowerShell\n\n### Basic usage (PowerShell)\n\nYou can use the\n[Windows PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/security/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell)\ncommand-line shell to connect to a CSC supercomputer using the\n[Win32 OpenSSH client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse).\nTo install OpenSSH on a Windows device, follow\n[these installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui#install-openssh-for-windows).\nAfter installing OpenSSH, you can connect to a CSC supercomputer by opening\nPowerShell and running:\n\n```bash\n# Replace <username> with the name of your CSC user account and\n# <host> with \"puhti\" or \"mahti\"\n\nssh <username>@<host>.csc.fi\n```\n\n### Graphical connection (PowerShell)\n\nIf you want to create a connection with graphical support,\nyou can use, for example, the\n[Xming X server](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/). To enable displaying\ngraphics remotely, run:\n\n```bash\n$env:DISPLAY=\"localhost:0.0\"\n```\n\nThen, use the `-X` (X11 forwarding) or `-Y` (trusted X11 forwarding) option when\ncreating the connection:\n\n```bash\nssh -X <username>@<host>.csc.fi\n```\n\n### Generating SSH keys (PowerShell)\n\nYou can generate SSH keys using PowerShell by running:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519\n```\n\n!!! note \"Using SSH keys\"\n    See the page on [setting up SSH keys](ssh-keys.md) for general\n    information about using SSH keys for authentication.\n\n### Copying public key to supercomputer (PowerShell)\n\nThe recommended way to copy a public key to a supercomputer is\n[through the My CSC customer portal](ssh-keys.md#adding-public-key-in-my-csc).\nAlternatively, you can do it using PowerShell by running the following\ncommand:\n\n```bash\n# The default location for SSH keys is \"C:\\Users\\<local-user>\\.ssh\\\"\n# and the default ED25519 key ID is \"id_ed25519\"\n\ncat C:\\Users\\<local-user>\\.ssh\\<key-id>.pub | ssh <csc-user>@<host>.csc.fi \"cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n```\n\n### Authentication agent (PowerShell)\n\nTo avoid having to type your passphrase every time you connect,\nyou can\n[configure the Windows SSH agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement?source=recommendations#user-key-generation)\nto store your keys in memory for the duration of your local login session.\n\n!!! warning \"Corrupted MAC on input\"\n    When connecting using the OpenSSH client software on Windows, you might\n    encounter an error stating \"Corrupted MAC on input\". This is a known\n    issue, and can be avoided by explicitly choosing a different MAC\n    algorithm. For details, please see\n    [our FAQ page on the topic](../../support/faq/i-cannot-login.md#why-is-my-ssh-client-saying-corrupted-mac-on-input).\n\n## PuTTY\n\n### Basic usage (PuTTY)\n\nThe [PuTTY SSH client](https://putty.org/) is an alternative to using OpenSSH.\nWhen you launch PuTTY, you are asked to configure your SSH session. Do so\naccording to the table below and click `Open`. You will be asked for your CSC\nusername and password, after which you are connected to the supercomputer.\n\n| Option | Value |\n|-|-|\n| **Host Name** | `puhti.csc.fi` or `mahti.csc.fi` |\n| **Port** | `22` |\n| **Connection type** | `SSH` |\n\n### Graphical connection (PuTTY)\n\nIf you want to create a connection with graphical support,\nyou can use, for example, the\n[Xming X server](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/). To enable displaying\ngraphics remotely, select `Enable X11 forwarding` in the PuTTY program settings\n(`Connection --> SSH --> X11`).\n\n### Generating SSH keys (PuTTY)\n\nTo generate SSH keys for connecting with PuTTY, use the [PuTTYgen key\ngenerator](https://www.puttygen.com/). The PuTTY documentation provides\n[instructions for using PuTTYgen](https://www.putty.be/0.76/htmldoc/Chapter8.html).\n\n### Copying public key to supercomputer (PuTTY)\n\nThe recommended way to copy a public key to a supercomputer is\n[through the My CSC customer portal](ssh-keys.md#adding-public-key-in-my-csc).\nAlternatively, you can do it using PuTTY by following the instructions below.\n\n1. Do one of the following:\n    1. Copy the public key (`ssh-ed25519 ...`) displayed in the PuTTYgen main\n    window to your clipboard. Make sure to scroll down to the bottom of the\n    text box.\n    2. Edit the public key file written by PuTTYgen so that all the file\n    contents are on one row and the key sequence does not contain any\n    spaces. Copy the public key from the file\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
