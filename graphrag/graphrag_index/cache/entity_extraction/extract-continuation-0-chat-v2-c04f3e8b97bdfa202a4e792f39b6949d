These are only intended as temporary storage space for data that is in\nactive use. All other data should be removed, or stored in other more suitable storage systems.\nUsers are not expected to use all of their quota, the maximum quota is only meant for\nshort-term bursts.\n\nAlso note that:\n\n* A Lustre parallel file system starts to lose performance when more than approximately 70% of\n  disk space is used, and the more the disks fill up, the slower the performance will get.\n  CSC has allocated more quota than there is space, hence it is not even possible for all users\n  to use their `scratch` folders for longer term storage.\n* There are **no backups** of `scratch` disk area. Do not trust it to store all of your research data.\n* Removing files may decrease the BU consumption of your project, since you are billed for excess disk usage beyond 1 TiB.\n\nWe kindly ask all users to help to keep disk usage manageable, and performance reasonable.\nPlease do the following tasks:\n\n* **Remove files** that are not needed anymore in your project's `scratch` folder.\n  Note that we cannot bring back files that you delete by mistake so do these operations carefully!\n* **Compress files** if it reduces file size. Ascii text files usually compress very well.\n  Test with one file first. If the file size drops by 50%, go ahead and compress all similar files.\n  [See here for available compression tools](env-guide/packing-and-compression-tools.md).\n* **Move files** not in active use now, but that need to be available later during the project.\n  The typical model is to move the files to [Allas](../../data/Allas/index.md).\n  We recommend to use [a-tools](../../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md) for small to\n  medium sized data transfers, in particular when you have a large amount of small files.\n  These tools make the usage of Allas safer, and can make your data management easier.\n  For very large data transfers we recommend using [rclone](../../data/Allas/using_allas/rclone.md).\n  A tutorial for data transfer is available at [allas-examples](../../data/Allas/allas-examples.md).\n* **Archive files** that should be available longer than the lifetime of compute projects.\n  Options for this can be for example your organizations own storage systems, or\n  [IDA safe storage for research data](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/).\n\n## Identifying where you have data\n\nIf you have a large amount of files, analyzing how much data you have in different folders can\nbe time consuming and also heavy on the file system. Our recommendations for tools that can\nshow the amount of data in folders:\n\n* **Avoid** using `find` options like `-size` or similar\n* **Avoid** using `du`\n* **Do** use `lue` or `lfs find --lazy`\n\nCSC has developed an approximate tool called LUE (Lustre usage explorer) for reporting amount of\ndata in folders. [Read the documentation at LUE](../../support/tutorials/lue.md) before using it.\n`lfs find --lazy` has some edge-case where it can be as bad as `du` or silently fail to get correct\nsize information. Run `man lfs-find` for further instructions and information on its limitations.\n\n!!! Note\n    No matter what tool you use you should never try to list or process all files in your project\n    or `scratch` folder with a single command. Instead you should run commands on specific\n    subdirectories with limited amount of files and data. The total amount of used data is\n    available from the `csc-workspaces` command.\n\n## Automatic removal of files\n\nThere is a policy of removing files older than 180 days from `scratch` (not `projappl`) to ensure\nthat only actively used data resides on the disk (currently implemented only on Puhti).\n\nFiles that will be deleted in the next clean up are listed in so called \"purge lists\" files.\nThese are split up by project, and can be found on Lustre at one of the locations below.\nOnly members of the project groups can access the project directories.\nIf your project is newly created, your project might not yet have its own subdirectory in\nthe `purge_lists` directory, in which case it won't participate in the automatic cleaning.\n\n* `/scratch/purge_lists/<PROJECT NAME>/path_summary.txt`\n* `/fmi/scratch/purge_lists/<PROJECT NAME>/path_summary.txt` (only on Puhti, for FMI projects)\n\nIn case the `path_summary.txt` file does not exist, your project did not have any files that matched\nthe clean-up criteria, and thus nothing will be deleted from it. To indicate that the file is\nintentionally missing, CSC will place a file named `nothing-to-remove-for-your-project` in your\nproject's purge_lists subdirectory, so check for the existence of this file as well.\n\nAs part of the automated cleaning process, the files will change names. Before the cleaning has\nbegun, each project that is part of the clean-up will have a file named `path_summary.txt`.\nIn special cases where a project is exempt from the upcoming cleaning, or requires more time to\ntransfer files, the administrators will rename the file to something else, usually\n`path_summary.txt-later-delete`. Once a project has been processed by the automated cleaning,\nthe file will be renamed to `path_summary.txt-stashed`. These files are\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of the computing environments where users manage data in project folders on scratch disks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another computing environment where users manage data in project folders on scratch disks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is the organization responsible for allocating quotas and managing the performance of the Lustre file system on Puhti and Mahti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lustre is a parallel file system used in Puhti and Mahti, known for its performance degradation when disk usage exceeds 70%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a storage system recommended for moving files not in active use, part of the data management tools provided by CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IDA is a safe storage service for research data, offering long-term archiving options)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUE (Lustre Usage Explorer) is a tool developed by CSC for reporting the amount of data in folders on Lustre file systems)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>CSC manages the computing environment and scratch disk policies on Puhti<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC<|>CSC manages the computing environment and scratch disk policies on Mahti<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE<|>CSC<|>CSC allocates quotas and monitors performance on the Lustre file system used in Puhti and Mahti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC<|>Allas is recommended by CSC for data storage, indicating management or endorsement by CSC<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDA<|>CSC<|>IDA is mentioned as an option for archiving files, suggesting a recommendation or partnership with CSC<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUE<|>CSC<|>LUE was developed by CSC for use in their computing environments<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
