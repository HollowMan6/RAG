To see which quota is used up, type:\n\n```bash\ncsc-workspaces\n```\n\nAn example output is shown below:\n\n```text\nPersonal home folder        Quota\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/users/jdoe                 Capacity:     653M/10G   Files:    .68k/100k\n\nProject applications        Quota\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/projappl/project_2000040   Capacity:   283.5M/50G   Files:    .37k/100k\n\nProject scratch             Quota\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/scratch/project_2000040    Capacity:   1.098T*/1T   Files:   .02k/1000k\n```\n\nThe asterisk (`*`) indicates which quota is exceeded. To be able to create\nnew files in this disk area you need to delete or move files elsewhere, e.g. to\n[Allas](../../data/Allas/index.md). If moving/deleting data is infeasible, you\ncan [apply for more quota](../../accounts/how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md).\n\n!!! warning \"Conda\"\n    A common reason for exceeding your `$HOME` or `/projappl` disk quota is the\n    usage of Conda-based installations. Conda environments result in the\n    creation of excessive numbers of files which cause extra load on the Lustre\n    parallel file system used in the HPC environment. This manifests as\n    prolonged startup times and disk slowness affecting all users.\n    \n    If you need to use Conda on CSC supercomputers, we require that you\n    [containerize](../../computing/containers/overview.md) your environment,\n    see [usage policy](../../computing/usage-policy.md#conda-installations). To\n    easily containerize your Conda environments, please see the\n    [Tykky container wrapper tool](../../computing/containers/tykky.md).\n\nIf you are new to containers, you can consult the following relevant sections\nof tutorials which are collected as part of previous CSC courses:\n\n - [Using CSC HPC Environment Efficiently course](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/)\n - [Containers and Workflows in Bioinformatics course](https://yetulaxman.github.io/containers-workflows/)\n\n## I have deleted many files, but still get disk quota exceeded warning?\n\nIt is common for some software to create hidden directories starting with a dot\n(`.`), such as `.cache`, `.cargo` or `.local`. These are often created by\ndefault in your personal home folder and may cause confusion if they make you\nexceed your disk quota. As hidden files are not shown by regular `ls` command,\nit may seem like moving/deleting most folders/files does not have any effect.\n\nTo also see all hidden files/directories in a given folder, you need to use\n`ls -a` option. [LUE (Lustre Usage Explorer)](../tutorials/lue.md) is another\nrecommended tool for finding where you have a lot of data that by default also\nchecks for hidden files and directories. Please use it if you exceed your disk\nquota and have a hard time figuring out where the files might be hiding. For\nexample:\n\n```bash\nmodule load lue\nlue $HOME\n```\n\n[See also this LUE tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/disk-areas/disk-areas-tutorial-lue.html).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides high-performance computing environment and advises on exceeding disk quotas and managing data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a data storage service recommended for moving files to manage disk space quotas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Conda is a package management system that can cause excessive numbers of files, affecting disk quotas in HPC environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tykky is a container wrapper tool recommended for containerizing Conda environments in CSC supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUE (LUSTRE USAGE EXPLORER)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUE is a tool for analyzing disk usage, including hidden files, in HPC environments)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDA<|>CSC<|>Conda installations can lead to exceeding disk quotas in CSC's HPC environment, requiring specific management practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC<|>Allas is recommended by CSC for managing disk space by moving files to alleviate quota exceedances<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY<|>CONDA<|>Tykky is recommended for containerizing Conda environments to mitigate disk quota issues on CSC supercomputers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUE (LUSTRE USAGE EXPLORER)<|>CSC<|>LUE is recommended by CSC for users to analyze and manage their disk usage effectively<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
