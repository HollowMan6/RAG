Certain features specific to OpenShift\nare only available when using the oc tool.\n\n## How to install the `oc` tool\n\nThe oc tool is a single binary that only needs to be included in your _path_. You may download it from the [latest release](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/latest) page in GitHub. The detailed instructions are:\n\n* Go to the aforementioned release page (<https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/latest>). In the bottom you will see the list of clients. Download the \"Openshift origin client\" corresponding to your OS (Windows, Mac or Linux).\n* Once downloaded, extract the `oc` binary file.\n* Copy the file to a folder in your `$PATH` and make it executable. For Mac and Linux the steps are similar to the following:\n\n```\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:~/bin\n$ mkdir -p ~/bin\n$ cp oc ~/bin/\n$ chmod +x ~/bin/oc\n```\n\nIn the example above, we are displaying the contents of the `$PATH` variable, choosing the bin folder in the home (~) folder, using `mkdir` just to be sure that the folder exist, copy the oc command (of course, we have to be in the folder `oc` was downloaded), and finally adding executable (`+x`) permissions to the `oc` binary. That is all.\n\nIn order to test that it was properly installed, open a new terminal, go to any folder, and run:\n\n```\n$ oc --help\n```\n\nIt should show the list of all available commands.\n\n## The \"Command Line Tools\" page in the OpenShift web UI\n\nInstructions for downloading the oc tool and logging in via the command line\ncan be found in the \"Command Line Tools\" page in the web interface:\n\n![Command line tools](../../img/cli_help_menu_3.7.png)\n\n## How to login with `oc`?\n\nThe oc login command to login can be found in one of the fields on the page. There is a\nbutton next to it for copying the command to the clipboard:\n\n![OpenShift Command Line Tools page](../../img/openshift_cli_dialog_3.7.png)\n\nCopy the command and paste it in a terminal to start using OpenShift via the\ncommand line.\n\n!!! note\n    If you open multiple terminals, the login session for oc will be active in\n    all of them.\n\n## How to login in the registry?\n\nIn order to use Rahti 1 internal container registry, it is necessary to login separately. Once you login, it is possible to use the client docker to `pull` and `push` from Rahti 1 registry.\n\n### Using personal account\n\nAfter login with `oc`, it is possible to use the command to generate a token (`oc whoami -t`):\n\n`docker login -p $(oc whoami -t ) -u unused docker-registry.rahti.csc.fi`\n\n### Using a service account token\n\nRahti 1 also offers the opportunity of using an internal service account to interact with the registry. This is recommended for automated procedures like a CI pipeline. Even though by default 3 internal service accounts are created in every Rahti 1 namespace: builder, default and deployer, it is recommended to create a dedicated internal service account and assign to it the `system:image-pusher` role.\n\n```sh\noc create serviceaccount pusher\noc policy add-role-to-user system:image-pusher pusher\ndocker login -p $(oc sa get-token pusher) -u unused docker-registry.rahti.csc.fi\n```\n\nThis service account token, the one you get with `oc sa get-token pusher` does not expire.\n\nCheckout this documentation to know how to upload images: [Using Rahti 2 integrated registry](../../rahti2/images/Using_Rahti_2_integrated_registry.md)\n\n## CLI cheat sheet\n\n**Basic usage:**\n\n```bash\noc <command> <--flags>\noc help <command>\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\nAuthorize the CLI tool to the cluster:\n\n```bash\noc login https://rahti.csc.fi:8443 --token=<secret access token>\n```\n\nThis command can be obtained by clicking your usename and \"Copy Login Command\"\nin the web console:\n\n![copy login](../../img/copy-login.png)\n\nShow projects:\n\n```bash\noc projects\n```\n\nSwitch to project `my-project`:\n\n```bash\noc project my-project\n```\n\nShow all pods in the current namespace:\n\n```bash\noc get pods\n```\n\nShow all pods in the namespace `<my-other-name-space>`:\n\n```bash\noc get pods -n <my-other-namespace>\n```\n\nShow all pods that have the key-value pair `app: myapp` in `metadata.labels`:\n\n```bash\noc get pods --selector app=myapp\n```\n\nPrint the specifications of the pod `mypod`\n\n```bash\noc get pod mypod -o yaml\n```\n\n### Other useful commands\n\n* `oc create` creates an object. Example: `oc create -f file.yaml`\n* `oc replace` replaces an object. Example: `oc replace -f file.yaml`\n* `oc delete` deletes an object in OpenShift. Example: `oc delete rc\n  myreplicationcontroller`\n* `oc apply` modifies an object according to the input. Example `oc apply -f\n  file.yaml`\n* `oc explain` prints out the API documentation. Example: `oc explain dc.spec`\n* `\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 1 is a platform that can be managed via command line tools such as OpenShift's oc tool or Kubernetes' kubectl tool, offering specific features for OpenShift when using the oc tool)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenShift provides the oc command line tool for managing applications and services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kubernetes offers the kubectl tool for managing containers and services across clusters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is used in conjunction with Rahti 1's internal container registry to pull and push images)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 1<|>OPENSHIFT<|>Rahti 1 utilizes OpenShift's oc tool for specific features and management capabilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 1<|>KUBERNETES<|>Rahti 1 can also be managed using Kubernetes' kubectl tool, indicating compatibility with Kubernetes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 1<|>DOCKER<|>Rahti 1's internal container registry requires login through Docker for pulling and pushing images, showing integration with Docker<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
