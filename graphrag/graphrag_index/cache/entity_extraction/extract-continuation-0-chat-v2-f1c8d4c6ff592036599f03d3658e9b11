Warning\n    Remember not to block your own access to the bucket, you can't access the bucket or fix the policy if you do so.\n\nIn the following IP policy example we allow access to bucket POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET from IP subnet 86.50.164.0/24. Let's name the policy file `myippolicy.json`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Id\": \"S3PolicyExample\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"IPAllow\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n            \"Principal\": \"*\",\n            \"Action\": \"s3:*\",\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\",\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*\"\n            ],\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"NotIpAddress\": {\n                    \"aws:SourceIp\": \"86.50.164.0/24\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nTo set this IP policy into our bucket, we use the `setpolicy` sub-command:\n\n```bash\ns3cmd setpolicy myippolicy.json s3://POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\n```\n\nThe current policy can be viewed with `info` sub-command.\n\nWe can delete current policy with `delpolicy` sub-command:\n\n```bash\ns3cmd delpolicy s3://POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\ns3://POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/: Policy deleted\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MY_FILE_02.TAR.GZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file set to be stored in S3 bucket MY_BUCKET with a specific tag for 1-day expiration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY_FILE_03.TAR.GZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file set to be stored in S3 bucket MY_BUCKET with a specific tag for 30-day expiration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY_FILE_04.TAR.GZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file set to be stored in S3 bucket MY_BUCKET in the daily folder, with a 30-day expiration rule)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY_FILE_05.TAR.GZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file set to be stored in S3 bucket MY_BUCKET in the weekly folder, with a 365-day expiration rule)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S3CMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command line tool for managing S3 and S3-compatible storage services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEPH STORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A unified, distributed storage system designed for excellent performance, reliability and scalability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An S3 bucket with a specific IP access policy set to allow access only from the IP subnet 86.50.164.0/24)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY_FILE_02.TAR.GZ<|>S3CMD<|>MY_FILE_02.tar.gz is uploaded to S3 using s3cmd with a specific tagging header for expiration<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY_FILE_03.TAR.GZ<|>S3CMD<|>MY_FILE_03.tar.gz is uploaded to S3 using s3cmd with a specific tagging header for expiration<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY_FILE_04.TAR.GZ<|>S3CMD<|>MY_FILE_04.tar.gz is uploaded to S3 using s3cmd into the daily folder<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY_FILE_05.TAR.GZ<|>S3CMD<|>MY_FILE_05.tar.gz is uploaded to S3 using s3cmd into the weekly folder<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET<|>S3CMD<|>POLICY-EXAMPLE-BUCKET has its IP access policy set and deleted using s3cmd<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
