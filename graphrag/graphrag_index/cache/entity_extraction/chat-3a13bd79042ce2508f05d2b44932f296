Select project (e.g. `project_NNNNN`) and click the plus-sign. There you can see all desktops that belongs to this project (`desktopname-NNNNNNNNNN`). Access virtual desktop by clicking the name.\n* **Recent connections**. Your recently used virtual desktops appear also here.\n\n![check the paragraph below](../sensitive-data/images/desktop/SD-Desktop-Frontpage.png)\n\n\nWhen you open the connection, a virtual computing environment will open in your browser. If you are accessing the virtual desktop for the first time, you will see the panel getting started, from which you can, for example, adjust the screen resolution.\n\n**You can work with your virtual desktop like with a standard computer**, accessing several pre-installed programs from the applications menu bar (top left corner). Examples include Open Office, image-viewing applications, video and audio players, Jupyter Notebooks etc. You can also open a terminal and use Linux from the command line. For more information on accessing R-Studio, please [check the paragraph below](#rstudio-on-sd-desktop).\n\n### Security-related features of the audited SD Desktop include:\n\n* The computing environment is **isolated from the internet**. You can, for example, open a Firefox web browser, but you are not able to access any site on the internet. You will also not be able to access any repositories directly.\n* The copy-paste function from your computer/laptop to your virtual desktop is limited for security reasons. [Instructions how to copy-paste](#copy-paste-from-your-laptop-to-virtual-desktop).\n\n### You can close your connection to your virtual Desktop in two ways:\n\n1. **Log out** from your Desktop (in the workspace view, top right corner of the browser, select your *username* and *log out*). This will close all applications in your virtual Desktop and disconnect the work session. You will be able to re-access the virtual Desktop at any time by logging in to the services.\n2. If you started a data analysis programmatically (you are running a script) you can close the browser window. This doesn't interfere with the processes running. Thus, when you reconnect to your Desktop, you have all your tools and interfaces still open and can continue working. However, remember to log out from the Desktop once the analysis is finished. If you leave more than ten connections open, you will be unable to re-access the services.\n\n!!! Note\n    **Never use the lock or reboot buttons** in SD Desktop as you will not be able to connect to the Desktop again after that.\n\n[![Access-virtual-Desktop](images/desktop/desktop-access.png)](images/desktop/desktop-access.png)\n\n\n## Accessing data using Data Gateway\n\nOnce you sign in to your virtual Desktop, you can access the data by following these steps:\n\n1. Open **Data Gateway** (you can find the application on your desktop);\n2. Select **SD Apply**;\n3. Click on **Continue**;\n4. In the new window, under the second step, click on **Create**. The application will create a new folder called **Projects** accessible from your Desktop or programmatically through the terminal.\n5. Click on **Open folder**.\n6. The files have been encrypted using the sensitive data public encryption key, and you will be able to access their content in *read-only mode*. The current streaming speed can be up to 50 MB/s.\n\n!!! Note\n    The _Projects_ folder is **available only when the Data Gateway application is open**. If you close or disconnect the application, you will not be able to access the data stored in the data service unless you previously made a full copy of it inside your Desktop. Thus, Data Gateway needs to be open and connected during data processing.\n\n[![Desktop-register-access](images/desktop/desktop-register-gateway.png)](images/desktop/desktop-register-gateway.png)\n\n## If you need to edit files/data\n\n * Access the files of interest in the *Project*-folder using **Data Gateway**;\n * Select all the necessary files from the *Project*-folder, make a **copy** and save it in the virtual Desktop's **home directory** (the files will be visible only from your browser) or in the **shared folder** (in this case, the files will be accessible also by the other CSC project members).\n\n[![Desktop-data-import](images/desktop/desktop-gateway-import.png)](images/desktop/desktop-gateway-import.png)\n\n\n### Copy-paste from your laptop to virtual desktop\n\nThe copy-paste function from your computer/laptop to your virtual desktop is limited for security reasons. However it is possible to copy-paste text with Clipboard:\n\n* Copy text normally from your computer (Cntrl+C).\n* Go to virtual desktop and open a Clipboard with a key combination **Cntrl+Alt+Shift**.\n* Paste your text to the Clipboard.\n* Copy the text again from the Clipboard. Please note that the Cntrl+C won't work here, use the mouse right-click instead.\n* Now you can paste the text inside your virtual desktop.\n* When you are ready, close the Clipboard with **Cntrl+Alt+Shift**.\n\n![SD Desktop Clipboard screenshot](images/desktop/SD-Desktop-Clipboard.png)\n\n## Default programs available on the Desktop and software customisation\n\nEach virtual Desktop is pre-built and contains a limited set of default open-source software (listed below). The virtual Desktop is isolated from the internet and **importing of software is restricted**, as required by the data permit authority.
