Containers and Apptainer\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/singularity/singularity-tutorial_running-installed.html\n---\n\n# Running containerized applications\n\nüí¨ In this tutorial we will get familiar with the basic usage of containerized\nsoftware.\n\nüí≠ Some software on CSC supercomputers have been installed as containers.\n\n- Usually, we try to make the containers as transparent as possible using\n  wrapper scripts. This way, there should be little to no change in usage from\n  the users' perspective.\n\nüí≠ Sometimes, however, this is impractical and there might be slight\ndifferences compared to the standard usage as described in the documentation.\n\n- Typically, this will also be the case for software you containerize yourself.\n  You can, however, use [Tykky](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/)\n  to create wrapper scripts to facilitate use of containers.\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Please see the software documentation in [Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)\nfor details and other considerations.\n\n- To run these exercises on Puhti, use `sinteractive` or open a compute node\n  shell in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi):\n\n  ```bash\n  sinteractive --account <project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n  ```\n\n## Example: A \"hidden\" installation\n\n1. An example of a container-based installation that has been \"hidden\" behind a\n   wrapper script is R. Load `r-env` module and check the contents of `Rscript`\n   command:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load r-env\n   cat /appl/soft/math/r-env/432/Rscript\n   ```\n\n2. Observe that it is not the \"real\" `Rscript` command, but a wrapper script\n   using `apptainer_wrapper exec`. Now, try running `Rscript`:\n\n   ```bash\n   Rscript --version\n   ```\n\n3. As you can see, `Rscript` works as expected, and in most cases you don't\n   need to care about the fact that it is installed as a container.\n\n   üí≠ You can find more details about using R in the Docs CSC page of the\n   [`r-env` module](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/).\n\n   üí° If you're unable to open an interactive session due to high load during the\n   course, you can try this example in a login shell instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load cutadapt\n   cutadapt -h\n   ```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC supercomputers have software installed as containers, aiming for transparency in usage through wrapper scripts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tykky provides a platform to create wrapper scripts to facilitate the use of containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCS CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docs CSC offers software documentation and details for running containerized applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a CSC supercomputer platform where users can run exercises and containerized applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R-ENV MODULE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module on CSC supercomputers for running R through a containerized installation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>TYKKY<|>CSC supercomputers utilize Tykky to create wrapper scripts for containerized software<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>DOCS CSC<|>Docs CSC provides documentation and user guides for software on CSC supercomputers<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti is one of the CSC supercomputers where containerized applications are run<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>R-ENV MODULE<|>The R-Env module is an example of containerized software available on CSC supercomputers<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
