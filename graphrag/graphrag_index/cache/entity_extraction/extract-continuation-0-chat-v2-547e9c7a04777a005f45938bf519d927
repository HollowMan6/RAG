Prerequisites\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 5\npermalink: /hands-on/connecting/ssh-keys.html\n---\n\n# Creating and adding SSH keys\n\nüí¨ SSH keys improve security and ease of use.\n\n> ‚òùüèª This tutorial assumes you've already logged in and have the prerequisites covered.\n\n## Windows 10\n\nüí¨ On Windows 10, there are multiple ssh clients available, such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html).\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è In this tutorial, we assume you use MobaXterm. [More examples can be found in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/).\n\n### Create SSH keys\n\nüí¨ The MobaXterm terminal has many Linux command line tools available, *e.g.* the ones to set up ssh keys:\n\n1. Launch MobaXterm from the applications list (opens from the windows logo) or search for it in the bottom bar search box.\n2. Open a terminal with it (*i.e.* you'll stay on your local machine)\n3. Follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/#setting-up-ssh-keys)\n\n### Set up MobaXterm to use the keys for Puhti\n\n‚òùüèª Some additional steps are needed to enable connecting to Puhti and using *e.g.* Jupyter Notebooks and R-servers from interactive batch jobs via your browser.\n\nüí¨ The next steps show how to edit your local ssh config file and how to use an ssh-agent to use your key securely to access Puhti.\n\n1. Continue the previous [guide at Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/#setting-up-ssh-keys)\n2. You will likely be asked to restart MobaXterm, do so.\n3. Select puhti.csc.fi from your left connections menu and try launching *e.g.*\n[Jupyter Notebook interactively and access it via your browser](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks/)\n\n## Linux\n\n1. Open a terminal on your **local machine**\n2. Create the SSH-key in the terminal by typing:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Accept the default name and location (or customize them if needed).\n4. Choose a secure passphrase for the SSH key.\n    - It should be at least 8 characters long and should contain numbers, letters and special characters.\n5. Copy the public key to Puhti (replace `cscusername` with your CSC username):\n\n```bash\nssh-copy-id cscusername@puhti.csc.fi\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 5\"}\n6. Connecting with SSH to Puhti should now proceed without the need to write your key passphrase\n\n## macOS\n\n1. Open a terminal on your **local machine**\n2. Create the SSH key in the terminal by typing:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Accept the default name and location (or customize them if needed).\n4. Choose a secure passphrase for the SSH key.\n    - It should be at least 8 characters long and should contain numbers, letters and special characters.\n5. Open `~/.ssh/config` and add the following lines into the file:\n\n```bash\nHost *\n    UseKeychain no\n    AddKeysToAgent yes\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 5\"}\n6. Open `~/.bash_profile` (or equivalent, see below ‚¨áÔ∏è) and add the following line:\n\n```bash\n[[ -z ${SSH_AUTH_SOCK+x} ]] && eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 6\"}\n7. Copy the SSH public key to Puhti by typing in the terminal (replace `cscusername` with your CSC username):\n\n```bash\nssh-copy-id cscusername@puhti.csc.fi\n```\n\n‚òùüèª Equivalent files for configuring profile in step 6.\n\n- `~/.bashrc`\n- `~/.bash_rc`\n- `~/.bash_profile`\n\nAnd with `zsh`-shell\n\n- `~/.zshrc`\n- `~/.zsh_rc`\n- `~/.zsh_profile`\n\n## More information\n\nüí≠ More in-depth [step-by-step instructions in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/#setting-up-ssh-keys).\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è If you make changes to your environment (e.g. edit `.bashrc`) in CSC supercomputers, it is possible that there will be conflicts with applications installed by CSC.\n\nüí≠ If you have problems after making changes to your environment, it is possible to restore it to default state permanently or temporarily using the [csc-env command](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MobaXterm is a software that provides Windows 10 users with a terminal that has many Linux command line tools available for setting up SSH keys)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing service provided by CSC that users can connect to using SSH keys for various computing tasks, including running Jupyter Notebooks and R-servers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is an organization that provides IT services for science and education, including computing and data management resources)##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS 10<|>GEO<|>Windows 10 is mentioned as an operating system where users can set up SSH keys using clients like PuTTY and MobaXterm)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is mentioned as an operating system where users can create SSH keys in the terminal for secure connections)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is mentioned as an operating system where users can create SSH keys in the terminal and configure their system to use these keys for secure connections)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>WINDOWS 10<|>MobaXterm is used on Windows 10 as a terminal for setting up SSH keys<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a computing service provided by CSC<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>MOBAXTERM<|>MobaXterm is used to connect to Puhti for computing tasks<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>WINDOWS 10<|>CSC provides documentation and support for setting up SSH keys on Windows 10<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>LINUX<|>CSC provides documentation and support for setting up SSH keys on Linux<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MACOS<|>CSC provides documentation and support for setting up SSH keys on macOS<|>5)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
