Whatever tool one chooses, it will\nunlikely match the particular workflow and underlying computing platform out of\nthe box. Some amount of programming is needed in most cases. A very much related\ndiscussion is in [Array jobs](../../computing/running/array-jobs.md)\nchapter of <https://docs.csc.fi>.\n\n## Strengths of GNU Parallel\n\n* Does not require a database or persistent manager process\n* Easily scales to a large number of tasks/nodes\n* Efficient use of scheduler resources\n\n## Disadvantages of GNU Parallel\n\n* User is required to do careful organization of input and output files\n* Scaling up requires consideration of system I/O performance\n* Modest familiarity with bash scripting recommended\n* Only serial subtasks\n* No support for dependencies or error recovery\n\n## System limits outline\n\nThe maximum number of jobs that each user can submit per month should be kept\nbelow one thousand. Too many batch jobs will generate excess log data and slows\ndown the job scheduler.\n[Array jobs](../../computing/running/array-jobs.md) are basically\njust a shorthand, so a single array job of 100 members counts the same as 100\nindividual jobs from the batch queue system's perspective.\n\nThe job maximum runtime is limited by the queue parameters. The minimum time is\nnot limited, but if the job is too short, it is just generating proportionally\nlarge scheduling overhead in the batch system.\n\n!!! Tip\n      A good target is to write batch\n      jobs that finish somewhere between two hours and two days.\n\nParallel file systems work poorly when a single client (application program)\ntries to perform too many file operations. Such cases can be e.g. applications\ninstalled with the Conda package manager directly on the shared file system. \nOne miniconda environment is easily over 20000 files and Anaconda distribution\nis much worse. Many of these files need to be opened every time a Conda application\nis launched. When running many, relatively short jobs, avoid running applications installed with Conda. However, if your application requires a complex environment,\nuse applications packed into Singularity containers, which are single files from\nthe perspective of the file system. To easily containerize a Conda environment,\nsee the [Tykky container wrapper tool](../../computing/containers/tykky.md)\n\n\"Too many files\" issues are also often encountered with workflows consisting of\nthousands of small runs. As a general guide, keep the number of files in a\nsingle directory well below one thousand, and organize your data into multiple\ndirectories. Also, use command `csc-workspaces` to monitor that the total number\nof files in your projects stays well below the limits. If most of the files are\ntemporary, or there simply is too many of them, using the fast local SSD disks\nin the\n[I/O nodes](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#local-storage)\ncan solve the problem. You can pack small files into a bigger archive file with\nthe `tar` command. Most importantly, if there are output files that you do not need,\nfind out how to turn off writing those in the first place.\n\nPlease contact <servicedesk@csc.fi> if your workflow needs help to fit into the\nlimits given above.\n\n\n## An example case, 80000 independent runs\n\nIn general, there are three pieces of input that are needed for designing the\nworkflow:\n\n1. How many runs there will be in total?\n2. How long does a single run take?\n4. How many files will be created?\n\nThe first two determine how the runs are grouped into batch jobs, and the last\none determines the directory hierarchy.\n\nLet's consider an example where we have 80000 independent, non-parallel\nsingle-core runs, each taking from 0 to 30 minutes, with a 15-minute average. In\nthe worst case, all the runs in a batch job take the maximum amount of time, 30\nminutes. We can see that a single 40-hour batch job should be enough for at\nleast 80 runs with a single core, and 3200 runs with all 40 cores in a full\ncompute node. Thus, all 80000 runs should fit in 25 40-hour batch jobs, each\nreserving one full compute node.\n\nLet's say our application is a real disk-hog, and in addition to one input file\nand one output file that we wish to keep, it also creates 100 temporary files in\nthe current directory. We can have at maximum about 400 input and output files\nin a single directory, and use the fast local disk in the I/O nodes for the\ntemporary files. For 80000 runs we thus get 200 directories, each with 400 runs.\n\n```\nmany\n    dir-001\n        input-001\n        input-002\n        ...\n        input-400\n    dir-002\n    ...\n    dir-200\n```\n\nAdditional consideration needs to be taken if the single runs are parallel, or\nthere are dependencies between them, but that's another story.\n\nLet's look at the job script for our example case:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40\n#SBATCH --time=40:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem=160G\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:3600\n#SBATCH --array=\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
