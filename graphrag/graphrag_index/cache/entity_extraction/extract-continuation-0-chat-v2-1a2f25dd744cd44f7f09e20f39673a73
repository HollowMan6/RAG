Professor Saara opens CSC projects ##\n\nProfessor Saara is running a large research project called _HiaNo_ in a Finnish university. \nThe project has just sent a set of samples to Analysis Service Center to be processed and analyzed. \nThe analysis takes some weeks and produces 80 TB of data that the research group will use in the actual research.\n\nSaara and Pekka, who is taking care of the data management, study the [storage options provided by CSC](https://research.csc.fi/data-management). They decide to use the Allas service for storing and sharing the data during the research project. The data is not sensitive personal data, so Allas is suitable.\n\nAs a first step, Saara and Pekka login to the [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi) and [register as CSC users](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md).\n\nThen Saara [creates two research projects](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md) at CSC: one called _Data management of the HiaNo project_ (project ID: project_2000444) and another called _HiaNo research project_ (project ID: project_2000333).\n\nOnce the CSC projects are established, Saara [activates the Allas, Puhti and cPouta services](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) for both projects. As Saara knows that the default storage space of Allas (10 TB) will not be enough for the incoming data set, she sends a request for 90 TB of Allas quota for the project _Data management of the HiaNo project_ to servicedesk@csc.fi.\n\nFinally, Saara [adds Pekka to both CSC projects](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md) and asks him to take care of the details of the incoming data.  \n\n## Act 2. Creating a shared bucket ##\n\nMats from Analysis Service Center contacts Pekka and tells that the results are available, and asks how he should deliver the data. Mats has an account at CSC (_msundber_ in the project _project_2000111_) with Allas enabled, so Pekka proposes that data be uploaded to Allas. For that purpose, Pekka creates a bucket in Allas and allows Mats to use it.\n\nPekka logs in to Puhti\n```text\nssh puhti.csc.fi   \n```\nand opens a connection to the data management project in Allas:\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf project_2000444\n```\nThen he creates a new bucket in Allas. There are many ways to do this but this time, Pekka does this by importing a new file to Allas with _a-put_:\n```text\necho “This bucket is used to host the original data of HiaNo project sample1” > README.txt\na-put -b hiano-project-sample001 README.txt\na-list hiano-project-sample001 \n```\nPekka included the project name in the bucket name (_hiano-project-sample001_) to make sure that the bucket name is unique in the whole Allas service. The _a-list_ command shows that the bucket was successfully created.\n\nNext Pekka uses the _a-access_ command to [modify the access rights of the new bucket](./using_allas/swift_client.md#giving-another-project-read-and-write-access-to-a-bucket) so that Mats (user _msundber_ from Allas _project_2000111_) is able so use it.\n```text\na-access +rw project_2000111 hiano-project-sample001\n```\nPekka still needs to send the name of the shared bucket to Mats, as normal Allas listing commands do not display the name for Mats who is not a member in the project that owns the bucket.\n\n## Act 3. Uploading data\n\nMats has [Allas tools](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils) installed in the front-end server of the measurement device at Analysis Service Center. Thus he can upload the data directly from the front-end server to the _hiano-project-sample1_ bucket in Allas:\n```text\nrclone copy sample1/cannel43/aa_3278830.dat  allas:hiano-project-sample001/sample1/cannel43/aa_3278830.dat\n```\nAs there is a large amount of data to be transported, the upload takes few days and needs to be done in several batches. When Mats tells that he is ready with the data uploads, Pekka closes the shared bucket:\n```text\na-access -rw project_2000111 hiano-project-sample001\n```\n\n## Act 4. Using the data in research ##\n\nOnce the data is available, the actual analysis work begins. There will be several users using the data set during the research project. Pekka knows that if all users use the data with full access rights (read and write), there is a danger that somebody accidentally deletes or overwrites some part of the data. Thus, it is agreed that while the data is hosted by the data management project (project_2000444), the researchers access the data through the _HiaNo research project_ (project_2000333).\n\nPekka gives read access\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAARA<|>PERSON<|>A professor coordinating an inspiring research project called HiaNo at a Finnish university)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEKKA<|>PERSON<|>A researcher responsible for the data management of the HiaNo project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATS<|>PERSON<|>A technician working at Analysis Service Center, involved in the data processing and analysis for the HiaNo project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XI<|>PERSON<|>A researcher working in the HiaNo research project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURA<|>PERSON<|>A researcher working in the HiaNo research project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service provided by CSC for storing and sharing data during research projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANALYSIS SERVICE CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A facility that processes and analyzes samples for research projects like HiaNo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Finnish IT center for science that provides services like Allas for data management and sharing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIANO<|>EVENT<|>A large research project run by Professor Saara at a Finnish university, involving data analysis and management)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAARA<|>HIANO<|>Saara is running the HiaNo research project<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEKKA<|>HIANO<|>Pekka is responsible for data management in the HiaNo project<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATS<|>ANALYSIS SERVICE CENTER<|>Mats works at the Analysis Service Center and is involved in the HiaNo project<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAARA<|>ALLAS<|>Saara decides to use Allas for storing and sharing data for the HiaNo project<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEKKA<|>ALLAS<|>Pekka manages the data in Allas for the HiaNo project<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIANO<|>ANALYSIS SERVICE CENTER<|>The HiaNo project sent samples to the Analysis Service Center for processing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XI<|>HIANO<|>Xi is a researcher in the HiaNo project<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURA<|>HIANO<|>Laura is a researcher in the HiaNo project<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
