You can download a copy of Rclone to your own computer \nfrom the link below.\n\n* [Rclone download site](https://rclone.org/downloads/)\n\nOnce you have Rclone installed you still need to configure the connection to Allas. Rclone is a \ncommand-line application so both configuration and actual usage is normally done in a command \nline: _Terminal_ in Mac and Linux, _Command prompt_ or _Powershell_ in Windows.\n\n## Configuring Allas connection in Mac and Linux (Swift and S3)\n\nIf you are using Rclone in a local **Linux** or **Mac machine**, you can download \nthe `allas_conf` script to set up the connection to your Allas project.\n\n```bash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/master/allas_conf\nsource allas_conf -u your-csc-username -p your-csc-project-name\n```\n\nNote that you should use the `-u` option to define your CSC username and `-p` to \ndefine the CSC project you want to use. For example:\n\n```bash\nsource allas_conf -u kkayttaj -p project_2001234\n```\n\nThe command above defines a connection that uses Swift protocol and is valid in the current\nterminal session for 8 hours. The Rclone _remote_ site name is in this case _allas_. After \nconfiguration you can for example list your buckets in Allas with command:\n\n```bash\nrclone lsd allas:\n```\n\nIf you want to use S3 protocol instead of Swift, add option `-m S3` to the configuration command. \n\n```bash\nsource allas_conf -u kkayttaj -p project_2001234 -m S3\n```\n\nNote that in order to run the command above you must have _OpenStack_ client installed in your local machine. After configuring S3 connection to Allas, you can use it through Rclone remote called _s3allas:_. For example:\n\n```bash\nrclone lsd s3allas:\n```\n\nS3 connection is active until you explicitly delete it with command:\n\n```bash\nsource allas_conf -u csc-user-name -p csc-project-name --s3remove\n```\n\n!!! Note\n    Remember to be careful and security-aware when configuring S3 connection to Allas. The S3 keys are stored in a readable format in your home directory and anyone who can read your keys can access Allas until the keys are expilicitly revoked from Allas. Removing the keys from your own computer is not enough to deactivate them.\n\n## Configuring Allas connection in Windows \n\nIn Windows machines you can't use `allas_conf` script. So for Windows some connection-specific variables need to be checked up in parallel from a Linux/Mac supporting `allas_conf` script. Easiest could be Puhti, if you use it otherwise. One option is also to use Windows Linux Subsystem and then the instructions above can be followed.\n\nConfigure the Allas connection with command:\n\n```bash\nrclone config\n```\n\nYou can use this command also in other machines where `allas_conf` is not available.\nThe command above launches a configuration process that you can use to define new Rclone \nconnection. In Rclone these defined connections are called _remotes_. \n\nBelow we describe how to create Swift and S3 connections to Allas.\n\n#### Configuring Swift connection in Windows\n\nStart the process by opening PowerShell and executing command:\n\n```bash\n.\\rclone.exe config\n```\n\nIn the interactive configuration process, do following selections:\n\n1. Select **n** to create a _New remote_\n2. Name the remote as: **allas**\n3. From the list of storage protocols, select the number that defines:\n_OpenStack Swift (Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)_\n4. Select authentication option **2**: _Get swift credentials from environment vars._\n5. After that select the default _blank_ setting for all the remaining settings until you are back in the starting menu of the configuration process. \n6. Finally, choose **q** to stop the configuration process.\n \nIn the case of Swift you need to do this configuration only once. In the configuration \nit is now defined that in case of _allas_, all data for the connection is read from environment variables.\n\nIf you have access to Puhti, then the easiest way to check the values of the variables needed is to open a terminal connection to it and activate there a connection to the Allas project you wish to use. Another option is to use a utility program [allas-get-swift-token-win.zip](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-get-swift-token/releases/download/v1.0.0/allas-get-swift-token-win.zip). If you choose to use the utility program, you (or your local IT-support) may have to configure your anti-virus etc. software to allow running it.\n\nIf you use Puhti for setting Swift access variables, activate the Allas environment in Puhti with commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf --show-powershell\n```\n\nWhen the configuration process in Puhti is ready, copy the last four lines, starting with `$Env:`, to the local PowerShell and execute them. Then test the Rclone connection with command:\n\n```bash\n  .\\rclone.exe lsd allas:\n```\n\nNote that also in this case the connection will work only for the next 8 hours.\n\n#### Configuring S3 connection in Windows\n\n!!! Note\n    Remember that you need to be careful and security-aware when configuring S3 connection to Allas\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
