It starts with a presentation of the [compiler suites][1]\nand [compiler wrappers][2] that you can use to compile your C, C++ or Fortran\ncode. Finally, some basic information on how to compile an [MPI][3] or\n[OpenMP][4] program is given.\n\n## Compiler Suites\n\nOn LUMI, the different compiler suites are accessible using module collections.\nThese collections load the appropriate modules to use one of the supported\nprogramming environments for LUMI.\n\n### Switching compiler suites\n\nThe compiler collections are accessible through [modules][modules] and in\nparticular, the `module load` command:\n\n```bash\n$ module load PrgEnv-<name>\n```\n\nwhere `<name>` is the name of the compiler suite. There are 3 collections\navailable on LUMI. The default collection is Cray.\n\n|      | Description                   | Module collection |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------|\n| CCE  | Cray Compiling Environment    | `PrgEnv-cray`     |\n| AMD  | AMD ROCm compilers            | `PrgEnv-amd`      |\n| GCC  | GNU Compiler Collection       | `PrgEnv-gnu`      |\n| AOCC | AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler | `PrgEnv-aocc`     |\n\nFor example, if you want to use the GNU’s compiler collection:\n\n```bash\n$ module load PrgEnv-gnu\n```\n\nAfter you have loaded a programming environment, the [compiler wrappers][2]\n(`cc`, `CC` and `ftn`) are available.\n\n??? Bug \"PrgEnv-aocc broken in 21.08 and 21.12\"\n    The ``PrgEnv-aocc`` module does not work correctly in the 21.08 and 21.12\n    releases of the Cray programming environment. This is due to different\n    reasons. The ``aocc/3.0.0`` module (used as the default version of AOCC in\n    the 21.08 release) is broken since the compilers themselves are not\n    installed. The ``aocc/3.1.0`` module has a bug in the code of the module.\n    This has been fixed in later releases of the Cray programming environment\n    so that the problem will be solved when those releases are installed. Due to\n    the way the installation of the Cray programming environment works, it is\n    currently not possible for us to correct the module by hand.\n\n### Changing compiler versions\n\nIf the default compiler version does not suit you, you can change the version\nafter having a loaded a programming environment. This operation is performed\nusing the `module swap` command.\n\n```bash\n$ module swap <compiler> <compiler>/<version>\n```\n\nwhere `<compiler>` is the name of the compiler module for the loaded\nprogramming environment and `<version>` the version you want to use. For\nexample\n\n=== \"CCE\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module swap cce cce/11.0.2\n    ```\n\n=== \"GNU\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module swap gcc gcc/10.2.0\n    ```\n\n## Compiler Wrappers\n\nThe module collection provides wrappers to the C, C++ and Fortran compilers. The\ncommands used to invoke these wrappers are listed below.\n\n- `cc`: C compiler\n- `CC`: C++ compiler\n- `ftn`: Fortran compiler\n\nNo matter which vendor's compiler module is loaded, always use one of the above\ncommands to invoke the compiler. Using these wrappers will invoke the\nunderlying compiler according to the [compiler suite][1] that is loaded in the\nenvironment. For some libraries, the appropriate option for the linking will\nalso be included. See [here][2.2] for more information.\n\n!!! note \"About MPI Wrappers\"\n    The Cray compiler wrappers replace other wrappers commonly found on HPC\n    systems like the `mpicc`, `mpic++` and `mpif90` wrappers. You don't need to\n    use these wrappers to compile an MPI code on LUMI. See [here][3].\n\nBelow are examples how to use the wrappers for the different programming languages.\n\n=== \"C\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ cc -c source1.c\n    $ cc -c source2.c\n    $ cc source1.o source2.o -o myprogram \n    ```\n\n=== \"C\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CRAY PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment available on LUMI for compiling C, C++, or Fortran code using compiler suites and wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform that provides access to various compiler suites and programming environments, including the Cray programming environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cray Compiling Environment, a compiler suite available on LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Represents AMD ROCm compilers, a compiler suite option on LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GNU Compiler Collection, a compiler suite option on LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AOCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler, a compiler suite option on LUMI)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CCE<|>LUMI<|>CCE is one of the compiler suites available on LUMI<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMD<|>LUMI<|>AMD ROCm compilers are available as a compiler suite on LUMI<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GCC<|>LUMI<|>GNU Compiler Collection is available as a compiler suite on LUMI<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AOCC<|>LUMI<|>AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler is available as a compiler suite on LUMI<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
