GPGPUs can significantly speed up certain algorithms and\napplications. The gpu.1. flavors have NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPGPUs.\nThe gpu.2.1gpu in ePouta have a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPGPU.\n\nThe GPGPUs are suitable for deep learning, scientific computing as\nwell as for remote desktops, rendering or visualization. The GPGPU\nflavors are backed by local SSD on the servers. The SSDs in gpu.1 flavors\nare configured in RAID-1. This is where the OS root disk is stored. With\ngpu.2 flavors, the SSDs are bigger and the SSDs are configured in RAID-0\nfor faster staging of datasets. You can use the volumes for storing larger\ndata sets and persistent data. If you need to read and write a lot of data\nbetween the disk and GPGPU, using volumes might affect performance when\ncompared to local SSD disk.\n\nTo take advantage of the acceleration which GPGPUs provide, the\napplications you run must support them. If you write\nyour own applications, the [optimization service] helps in\nleveraging the GPGPUs.\n\nGPGPUs can be used for a lot of cool and interesting things,\nbut please remember the resource usage must comply with the [Terms of Use].\n\nLimitations and caveats: \n\n-   As we use PCI passthrough to get the whole GPGPU into the\n    instance. The administrators are not able to access the GPGPU and\n    check its health. Please report any errors or problems with the GPGPUs\n    to CSC (and attach the output of the command \"nvidia-smi -q\").\n-   The applications must be able to utilize the GPU to get a speedup. Even\n    though there is no specific speedup target to be met to enable GPU usage\n    on Pouta, it is best to aim for higher speedups to compensate for the\n    relatively higher prices per hour associated with GPUs and their\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>XEON(R) CPU E5-2690 V3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CPU model with hyper-threading technology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XEON(R) CPU E5-2680 V3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CPU model with hyper-threading technology used in cPouta IO flavor characteristics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMD EPYC 7282 16-CORE PROCESSOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CPU model used in io.2.* flavor characteristics with redundant 25 Gb/s network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMD EPYC 7313 16-CORE PROCESSOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CPU model used in io.2.* flavor characteristics with redundant 25 Gb/s network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPGPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPU model used in gpu.1. flavors for high performance computing applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPGPU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPU model used in gpu.2.1gpu in ePouta for high performance computing applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entity responsible for addressing errors or problems with GPGPUs, users are advised to report issues to CSC)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XEON(R) CPU E5-2680 V3<|>CPouta IO FLAVOR CHARACTERISTICS<|>The Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 is used in cPouta IO flavor characteristics for virtual machines<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMD EPYC 7282 16-CORE PROCESSOR<|>IO.2.*<|>The AMD EPYC 7282 16-Core Processor is specified for io.2.* flavor characteristics<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMD EPYC 7313 16-CORE PROCESSOR<|>IO.2.*<|>The AMD EPYC 7313 16-Core Processor is specified for io.2.* flavor characteristics with redundant 25 Gb/s network<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPGPUS<|>GPU.1.<|>NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPGPUs are used in gpu.1. flavors for high performance compute applications<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPGPU<|>GPU.2.1GPU<|>NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPGPU is used in gpu.2.1gpu in ePouta for high performance computing applications<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPGPUS<|>CSC is responsible for addressing errors or problems with NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPGPUs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPGPU<|>CSC is responsible for addressing errors or problems with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPGPU<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
