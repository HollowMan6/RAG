In this example, we assume that the Mothur commands are in the file `my_mothur_task.txt`.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=project_1234567\n#SBATCH --job-name=mothur\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --mem=32G\n#SBATCH --time=48:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nmodule load mothur\nmothur my_mothur_task.txt\n```\n\nIf you want to use multiple cores, adjust parameter `--cpus_per_task`. You must also adjust the `processors` parameter for each command in the Mothur command file accordingly. Note that only some [Mothur commands](https://docs.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/apps/bio/mothur/) can use multiple cores.\n\nMothur jobs need to run inside a single node, so the maximum number of cores you can use on Puhti is 40. You should check the scalability before submitting large jobs. Many Mothur tasks won't scale well beyond a few cores. Using too many cores may even make your job run slower.\n\nThe batch job script described above (in this case named as `mothur_batch_job.sh`) can be submitted to the batch job system\nwith the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch mothur_batch_job.sh\n```\n\nSee the [Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md) for more information about running batch jobs.\n\n## Support\n\n[CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md)\n\n## More information\n\n- [Mothur Homepage](https://www.mothur.org/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MOTHUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mothur is a bioinformatics toolkit designed to meet the data analysis needs of microbial ecology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU GPLv3<|>EVENT<|>The license under which Mothur is freely available and open source)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform where Mothur is available in versions 1.39.5, 1.44.0, and 1.48.0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIPSTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A graphical user interface for Mothur available at chipster.csc.fi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Support service for Mothur users)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTHUR<|>GNU GPLv3<|>Mothur is licensed under GNU GPLv3, making it free and open source<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTHUR<|>PUHTI<|>Mothur is available on Puhti in multiple versions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTHUR<|>CHIPSTER<|>Mothur can be used through the Chipster graphical user interface<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTHUR<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>Users of Mothur can seek support from the CSC Service Desk<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
