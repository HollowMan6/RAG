The script doubles\n`dim` until it exceeds `dim_end`. Make a new _batch script_ to run your\nR-script `mem-test.R`. In addition to the resource requests your\nscript needs to load the R-environment and then run the R-script (as in\nprevious exercise). Submit the script with `sbatch`.\n\nOnce the job has been completed (how can you check if it is running or\nqueuing?), check with `sacct` or `seff` how much memory was used as\nin the previous exercise. If the job completed successfully, increase\nthe `dim_end` variable in your script *i.e.* make a bigger matrix and\nrerun the job. Note also the time it takes to run the job. How does the\ntime and memory needed by the job depend on the number of elements in\nthe array?\n\n  max(dim) |  # of elements  | Time [s] (Elapsed) |  Memory used (MaxRSS)\n  ----------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------\n  | | | \n  | | |  \n  | | |  \n  | | |  \n\n- **How big matrix is needed to exceed the default allowed memory of the batch job?**\n\n## Scaling test for an MPI parallel job\n\nBefore running parallel jobs it is important to determine how the job\nscales. It does not make sense to use many cores, if this does not speed\nup the job. The speedup depends on the application but also input. In\nthis tutorial we'll use CP2K which can use thousands of cores for\ncertain job types and model systems (but not for this one). Therefore,\nit is important to test the scaling for each different job type (or\nmodel system type). The idea is not to run production simulations, but\nquick short simulations (*i.e.* using the actual production system) but\nonly for like 1-5 minutes, which will be enough to reveal the\nperformance.\n\n### a) Prepare a CP2k job\n\nFirst copy the input file to your working directory:\n\n```\nmodule load cp2k`\ncp $CP2K_DATA_DIR/tests/QS/benchmark/H2O-32.inp .\n```\n\nThen create a batch script and submit it with `sbatch`\n!!! Tip\n    Remember to check the CSC software pages for [application specific\n    examples for batch jobs:](../../apps/index.md)\n\nFor the first job, ask minimal resources (copy the rest of the\nbatch script contents from CSC's CP2k page):\n\n```\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n\n# submit the job\nsrun cp2k.popt H2O-32.inp > H2O-32_$SLURM_NPROCS.out\n```\n\n### b) Run the same job with increasing resources and note performance\n\nAfter running the job with one core, edit the batch script to use more\ncores/mpitasks (*e.g.* 2,4,8,16, ... this is the `--ntasks` or `--ntasks-per-node` flag)\nand rerun\nthe job. The output files will be named with the number of cores used to\nrun them (`$SLURM_NPROCS`). Instead of the small partition you can\nalso use the `test` partition. If you ask for more than 40 cores (in Puhti), you\nneed to switch to `large` partition. In multinode jobs, always \nlimit the number of *Nodes*, so that the job is not spread onto\nmore nodes than necessary as it\n[creates unwanted communication overhead and fragments the allocations on the system](../../computing/running/performance-checklist.md).\n\nWith the following command you can sum the time spent at different steps\nfor each job.\n\n`grep \"CPU TIME\" H2O-32_1.out | awk '{a+=$5;print a}'`\n\nCheck with `seff JOBID` how much memory the simulation used (compare\n`sacct` and `seff` output!) and fill in the data in the following\ntable. If your code does not print out either the performance or used\ntime, you can use the `sacct` command (`sacct -j <JOBID> -o\nelapsed,alloc,maxrss`)\n\nA rule of thumb for acceptable scaling is that when you double the resources,\nthe job should speed up at least 1.5 fold. Ideally it would speed up\nlinearly with resources *i.e.* 2 fold, so often you're better off running many\nsmaller simulations at the same time, rather than few with very many cores - if\nyou have this option.\n\nThe speedup at some core counts may be off the trend. There may be\nvariation due to load on the system or because the code/system does not\nparallelize well or be able to distribute the computational load for\nthat particular core count. Sometimes rerun helps to sort out an\noutlier. If you know the code parallelizes well, there is no point to\nstart testing from 1 core, but from where you think the code runs well.\nYou'll notice bad speedup anyway.\n\n  # cores | Time [s] (Elapsed) | Speedup | Ideal speedup | Memory used\n  ----------|----------------------|---------|---------------|-------------\n | | | | \n | | | | \n\n\n### c) Scaling test results\n\n- **How many cores can you use efficiently?
