Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 6\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/installing_hands-on_java.html\n---\n\n# Installing Java applications (on Puhti)\n\nüí¨ Java applications do not typically require special installation.\n\n- You just need to download the distribution package, typically a `.jar` file.\n\nüí° Compute nodes do not have a default Java installation, so you need to load a\nsuitable Java module.\n\nYou can check the available modules with the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider java\n```\n\nüí¨ Despite their name, modules named `biojava` are just normal Java\ninstallations, which can be used with any software, not just bio applications.\n\n‚òùüèª Some java applications fail to run on the login nodes. Try running them\nusing `sinteractive` instead (or by opening a compute node shell in the\n[Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)).\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Naturally, computationally heavy tasks should be never ran on the login\nnodes.\n\nüí° The compute nodes have very limited `/tmp` space. If you have to set the\ntemporary file location for a Java application, you can use:\n\n```bash\nexport _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/tmp  # replace with the actual path \n```\n\n## Example: Installing ABRA2\n\nüí¨ In this example we'll install and run the Java application ABRA2.\n\n1. Create a personal folder (if not done already) under your project's\n   `/projappl` directory and move there. Then create (and move to) a new\n   directory for the installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd /projappl/<project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   mkdir -p $USER\n   cd $USER\n   mkdir abra2\n   cd abra2\n   ```\n\n2. Download the software:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://github.com/mozack/abra2/releases/download/v2.24/abra2-2.24.jar\n   ```\n\n3. Load a Java module:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load biojava\n   ```\n\n   üí° If you get error messages or warnings about the Java version, try loading\n   another Java module.\n\n4. Run the application:\n\n   ```bash\n   java -jar abra2-2.24.jar\n   ```\n\n   üí° If you are not in the same directory as the `.jar` file, you need to\n   include the full path to the file, e.g.\n\n   ```bash\n   java -jar /projappl/<project>/$USER/abra2/abra2-2.24.jar  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234, and ensure that the path corresponds to the true path\n   ```\n\n## Example 2: Java application with a shell wrapper script\n\nüí¨ Some Java applications come with shell scripts that are used to launch them\ninstead of calling Java directly. See the documentation of each software for\ndetails.\n\nüí° One example of such an application is BEAST:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\nmodule load beast\nbeast -help\n```\n\n‚òùüèª BEAST will fail to run on the login nodes. Try running it in an interactive\nsession instead (using `sinteractive` or a compute node shell in the\n[Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
