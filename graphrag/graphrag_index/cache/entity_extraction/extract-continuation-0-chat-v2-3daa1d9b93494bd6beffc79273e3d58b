The software is developed and\ndistributed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group at the\nBeckman Institute of the University of Illinois.\n\n## Available\n\nThe following versions are available:\n\n* Puhti: 2.14, 2.14-cuda, 3.0alpha11-cuda, 3.0b6-cuda\n* Mahti: 2.14\n* LUMI: 3.0, 3.0-gpu\n\n## License\n\nCSC has obtained a computing center\n[license](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/license.html), which allows\nusage for non-commercial research. For commercial use, contact\n<mailto:namd@ks.uiuc.edu>. See also [acknowledging usage below](#references).\n\n## Usage\n\nNAMD can be run either with CPUs or with GPUs + CPUs. GPU versions support\nsingle-node jobs only.\n\n### Performance considerations\n\nTests show that leaving one core for communication for each task is beneficial\nwhen running on multiple CPU nodes:\n\n```bash\n(( namd_threads = SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK - 1 ))\n```\n\nThis is also recommended by the\n[NAMD manual](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.14/ug/node104.html).\nPlease test with your input.\n\nMake sure `--ntasks-per-node` multiplied by `--cpus-per-task` equals 40 (Puhti)\nor 128 (Mahti), i.e. all cores in a node. Try different ratios and select the\noptimal one.\n\nThe data below shows the ApoA1 benchmark (92k atoms, 2 fs timestep) on Mahti\nwith ns/day as a function of allocated nodes and varying the number of\n`namd_threads` as set in the\n[Mahti script below](#batch-script-examples).\n\n![NAMD Scaling on Mahti](../img/namd-scaling.svg 'NAMD Scaling on Mahti')\n\nThe data also shows the following things:\n\n* Optimal settings depend on the amount of resources in addition to system and\n  run parameters.\n    * For this system, as the amount of resources are increased, the optimum\n      performance shifts from more threads per task (15) towards fewer threads\n      per task (3).\n* 1 GPU (+ 10 CPU cores) on Puhti gives a performance that is comparable to\n  running on two full Mahti nodes. However, note that using more resources to\n  get results faster is also more expensive in terms of consumed billing units.\n  To avoid wasting resources, ensure that your job actually benefits from\n  increasing the number of cores. You should get at least a 1.5-fold speedup\n  when doubling the amount of resources.\n* To test your own system, run e.g. 1000 steps of dynamics and search for the\n  `Benchmark time:` line in the output.\n\n!!! info \"NAMD 3.0\"\n    NAMD3 shows an 2-3 times improved GPU performance over NAMD2, e.g. 160\n    ns/day vs. 55 ns/day for the ApoA1 system on Puhti.\n\n#### Multi-GPU performance\n\nThe plot below shows the scalability of NAMD 3.0 on LUMI-G. To run on\nmultiple GPUs (GCDs) efficiently, you typically need a rather large systems\ncomposed of at least several hundred thousand atoms, such as the STMV case\nbelow. Check with your system and see the\n[NAMD website](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/3.0/features.html)\nfor available features that allow you to maximize the performance\nof multi-GPU runs. Importantly, enabling GPU-resident mode using configuration\nfile option `GPUresident on` is beneficial.\n\n![NAMD Scaling on LUMI-G](../img/namd-lumig.svg 'NAMD Scaling on LUMI-G')\n\n### Batch script examples\n\n=== \"Puhti CPU\"\n    The script below requests 5 tasks per node and 8 threads per task on two\n    full Puhti nodes (80 cores). One thread per task is reserved for\n    communication.\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash \n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=test\n    #SBATCH --time=0:10:00\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2             \n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=5   # test to find the optimum number\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8     # 40/(ntasks-per-node)\n\n    module purge\n    module load gcc/11.3.0\n    module load openmpi/4.1.4\n    module load namd/2.14\n\n    # leave one core per process for communication\n    (( namd_threads = SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK - 1 ))\n\n    srun namd2 +ppn ${namd_threads} apoa1.namd > apoa1.out\n\n    # while NAMD suggests using 1 thread per task for communication (as above)\n    # all cores for computing can be tested with:\n    # srun namd2 +ppn ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} apoa1.namd > apoa1.out\n    ```\n\n=== \"Puhti GPU\"\n    Note, NAMD2 runs most efficiently on one GPU, and this is usually more\n    cost-efficient than running on multiple CPU-only nodes.\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash \n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NAMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code for simulation of large biomolecular systems, developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group at the Beckman Institute of the University of Illinois)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Group at the Beckman Institute of the University of Illinois responsible for developing NAMD)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BECKMAN INSTITUTE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institute where the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group develops NAMD)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Computing environment where NAMD versions 2.14, 2.14-cuda, 3.0alpha11-cuda, and 3.0b6-cuda are available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Computing environment where NAMD version 2.14 is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Computing environment where NAMD versions 3.0 and 3.0-gpu are available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization that has obtained a computing center license for NAMD, allowing its usage for non-commercial research)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMD<|>THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS GROUP<|>NAMD is developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS GROUP<|>BECKMAN INSTITUTE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS<|>The group is part of the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMD<|>PUHTI<|>NAMD versions are available on Puhti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMD<|>MAHTI<|>NAMD version is available on Mahti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMD<|>LUMI<|>NAMD versions are available on LUMI computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMD<|>CSC<|>CSC has obtained a license for NAMD for non-commercial research<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
