Using the storage requires an account, a CSC project, a Rahti 1 Namespace, and at least a Pod.\n\nOne of the pillars of Docker is the immutability of images, once they are built, docker images never change. The issue for most of the applications is that it is necessary to store, update and later retrieve application data. In docker, this is solved by the concept of volumes, an external filesystem (to docker) that is mounted in the internal filesystem of a container. In Kubernetes, and by extension OpenShift, this problem can be solved in several ways.\n\n![Storage options](../../img/storage-options.drawio.svg)\n\n## Persistent storage\n\nThe solution more similar to Docker volumes is a [Persistent volume](persistent.md). This is a volume located in an external storage, that is mounted directly into the filesystem of the container like an additional hard disk would. This is the best solution for a seamless storage solution. You can also unmount it from the Pods it is attached to and attach it to another set of Pods. Moreover, persistent volumes represent a reliable storage option as the data in them is replicated.\n\nYou can find additional information on the [Persistent volume](persistent.md) page.\n\n## Ephemeral storage\n\nOther solution is to use ephemeral storage, called in Kubernetes an _Empty dir_. This is only meant for storing intermediate or temporal data, that needs fast read write access by the applications running inside the containers. The same _Empty dir_ can be mounted in every container inside a Pod. The data in the ephemeral storage is lost when the Pod is deleted. Given that the data in the ephemeral you should not store any persistent data there, and the ephemeral storage should not be considered reliable.\n\nYou can find additional information on the [Ephemeral storage](ephemeral.md) page.\n\n## Object storage\n\nIn case you need to store large volumes of data, or you need that your data can be easily accessed over the Internet, e.g., using URLs, object storage is the storage solution you are looking for. By using object storage, you are free to create and delete your Pods as the object storage is not tied to any Pod. Moreover, your data is replicated, thus object storage represents a reliable long-term storage option.\n\nAt CSC, we offer Allas as our object storage solution. You can find additional information on the [Allas page](../../../data/Allas/index.md).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides the Rahti 1 environment, offering various storage options and solutions including Persistent volume, Ephemeral storage, and Object storage through Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 1 NAMESPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A namespace within CSC's Rahti 1 environment required for using storage options)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technology platform that uses the concept of containers and volumes for application deployment and storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, involved in solving storage issues in conjunction with OpenShift)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A container application platform that integrates Docker and Kubernetes, facilitating the management of storage solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUME<|>EVENT<|>A storage solution similar to Docker volumes, located in external storage and mounted directly into the filesystem of a container for seamless storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPHEMERAL STORAGE<|>EVENT<|>A temporary storage solution in Kubernetes for intermediate or temporal data, lost when the Pod is deleted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>EVENT<|>A storage solution for large volumes of data or data that needs to be easily accessed over the Internet, offered by CSC as Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC's object storage solution, providing reliable long-term storage options)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>RAHTI 1 NAMESPACE<|>CSC provides the Rahti 1 environment which includes the Rahti 1 Namespace as a requirement for using storage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PERSISTENT VOLUME<|>CSC offers Persistent volume as a storage solution in the Rahti 1 environment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>EPHEMERAL STORAGE<|>CSC supports Ephemeral storage in the Rahti 1 environment for temporary data storage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>CSC provides Object storage through Allas in the Rahti 1 environment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>ALLAS<|>Allas is CSC's solution for object storage within the Rahti 1 environment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUME<|>DOCKER<|>Persistent volume is a concept similar to Docker volumes for external storage mounted into containers<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPHEMERAL STORAGE<|>KUBERNETES<|>Ephemeral storage is a Kubernetes concept for temporary data storage within containers<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>ALLAS<|>Object storage in the Rahti 1 environment is provided through Allas by CSC<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
