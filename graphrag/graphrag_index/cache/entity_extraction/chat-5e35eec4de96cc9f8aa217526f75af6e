The LUMI\n    PyTorch module now includes [vLLM version\n    0.5.5](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) in addition to\n    FlashAttention-2, bitsandbytes and many other frequently requested\n    packages already added included in earlier installations. The LUMI\n    module still uses old-style wrappers (not the tykky-based wrappers\n    as in Puhti and Mahti).\n\n    **21.8.2024** PyTorch 2.4 added to Puhti and Mahti. The LUMI\n    installation will be delayed until after the current service\n    break. The torchtext package is no longer included as it has been\n    deprecated and no longer works with PyTorch 2.4.\n\n    **13.6.2024** PyTorch 2.3 added to Puhti and Mahti. The LUMI\n    installation will be delayed until early autumn due to an incompatible\n    ROCm driver version. This version has also updated how Python commands\n    are wrapped, as this solves several problems with using virtual\n    environments and Jupyter Notebooks. Due to this `apptainer` and\n    `apptainer_wrapper` commands will no longer work, but otherwise the\n    change should be invisible to users.\n\n    **1.3.2024** PyTorch 2.2 added to Puhti, Mahti and LUMI. The LUMI\n    module includes ROCm versions of \n    [FlashAttention-2](https://github.com/ROCm/flash-attention) \n    and [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/ROCm/bitsandbytes) as these are\n    difficult for users to add themselves. \n    [xFormers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) has been added \n    to all three systems.\n\n    **17.11.2023** PyTorch 2.1 added to Puhti, Mahti and LUMI. Horovod has\n    been removed, we recommend using [PyTorch DDP](../support/tutorials/ml-multi.md) \n    instead. [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) \n    was added to the Puhti and Mahti version.\n    \n    **5.10.2022** Due to Puhti's update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8\n    (RHEL8), **the number of fully supported PyTorch versions has been\n    reduced. Previously deprecated conda-based versions have been\n    removed.** Please [contact our servicedesk](../support/contact.md) if\n    you really need access to older versions.\n\n    **5.5.2022** Due to Mahti's update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL8),\n    the number of fully supported PyTorch versions has been reduced. Please [contact our\n    servicedesk](../support/contact.md) if you really need access to other versions.\n\n    **4.2.2022** All old PyTorch versions which were based on direct Conda\n    installations have been deprecated, and we encourage users to move to newer\n    versions. Read more on our separate [Conda deprecation page](../support/tutorials/conda.md).\n\n\n## Available\n\nCurrently supported PyTorch versions:\n\n| Version | Module         | Puhti | Mahti | LUMI | Notes                      |\n|:--------|----------------|:-----:|:-----:|------|:---------------------------|\n| 2.4.1   | `pytorch/2.4`  | -     | -     | X    | default version            |\n| 2.4.0   | `pytorch/2.4`  | X     | X     | -    | New tykky-based wrappers   |\n| 2.3.1   | `pytorch/2.3`  | X     | X     | -    | New tykky-based wrappers   |\n| 2.2.2   | `pytorch/2.2`  | -     | -     | X    | default version            |\n| 2.2.1   | `pytorch/2.2`  | X     | X     | -    |                            |\n| 2.1.2   | `pytorch/2.1`  | -     | -     | X    |                            |\n| 2.1.0   | `pytorch/2.1`  | X     | X     | -    |                            |\n| 2.0.1   | `pytorch/2.0`  | -     | -     | X    |                            |\n| 2.0.0   | `pytorch/2.0`  | X     | X     | -    |                            |\n| 1.13.1  | `pytorch/1.13` | -     | -     | X    | limited multi-node support |\n| 1.13.0  | `pytorch/1.13` | X     | X     | -    |                            |\n| 1.12.0  | `pytorch/1.12` | X     | X     | -    |                            |\n| 1.11.0  | `pytorch/1.11` |\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
