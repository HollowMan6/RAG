under user's home directory, in a directory called `.ssh` - and asks to add a password into it.\n\n```text\n$ ssh-keygen\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_rsa):\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nYour identification has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nYour public key has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:Z/IxPJHY5fO7k28819BXw4jRZeQaNGdSq1GGPneuZ+8 username@usercomputer\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+---[RSA 3072]----+\n|            o+=X |\n|         o =.oX .|\n|        . + *ooo |\n|         . o *=+o|\n|        S B  o+o+|\n|         = +  ..+|\n|          .   .=o|\n|              +oB|\n|              .BE|\n+----[SHA256]-----+\n$ ls -l .ssh | grep rsa\n-rw-------  1 username  staff   2655 Nov 18 08:24 id_rsa\n-rw-r--r--  1 username  staff    577 Nov 18 08:24 id_rsa.pub\n$\n```\n\nAfter the command exits, two files may be found from the .ssh directory.\n\n!!! success \"Key pair created\"\n\n    By default the `ssh-keygen` command creates a private key named **id_rsa** and a public key named **id_rsa.pub**.\n\nBelow is an example execution of the command in Windows 11 PowerShell.\n\n![Creating an SSH key pair in Windows 11](../img/cloud_tutorial_ssh_key_pair_powershell.png 'A screencapture of the Windows 11')\n\n## Adding an existing key pair to OpenStack\n\nIf you have an existing key pair or have created one on your computer, it can be added to OpenStack environment.\n\nTo do this, you need to be signed in to one of the Pouta services.\n\n1. Go to the **Compute > Key Pairs** section, and select **Import Public Key**.\n2. Give the key pair a name.\n3. Either use **Choose File** button and select **id_rsa.pub** file or copy + paste the content of it to the **Public Key** text area.\n4. Click **Import Public Key** button.\n\n![Importing an existing SSH key pair.](../img/cloud_tutorial_ssh_key_pair_import.png 'Import Public Key view in OpenStack')\n\n!!! info \"Tip\"\n\n    To ensure compatibility with OpenStack and to distinguish between multiple keys, it is recommended to use the command in the following form: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f keyname.key`.\n\n## Creating an SSH key in OpenStack\n\nThis chapter will walk you through creating an SSH key pair in the OpenStack web interface. You must be signed in to one of the Pouta services.\n\n1. Go to the **Compute > Key Pairs** section, and select **Create Key Pair**.\n\n    ![The Access & Security subpage in the cPouta web interface](../../img/pouta-user-guide-keypairs.png 'ssh key pairs')\n\n    **Figure** The _Access & Security_ subpage in the cPouta web interface\n\n1. Give your key a name and click in **Create Key Pair**. You will get a \"_keyname.pem_\" to save. Save it in your home directory. This will be the last time you will be able to download this **private key**, Pouta does not keep a copy in its servers.\n\n    ![Create key](../../img/pouta-create-key.png)\n\n    **Figure** The Create Key Pair dialog\n\n### Linux and Mac\n\nIn order to install the key you downloaded in the previous step (_keyname.pem_ or _keyname.cer_), you must run this commmands:\n\n!!! info \"For macOS\"\n\n    If you are using Chrome browser in macOS Monterey, you will get keyname.cer instead of keyname.pem. The following procedure will remain same.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh\nchmod 700 .ssh\nmv keyname.pem ~/.ssh\nchmod 400 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem\n```\n\n!!! info \"400 = Only owner can read\"\n\n    When a file in Unix has 400 permissions, it translates to:\n    `r-- --- ---`\n\n    which means, only the owner can read the file. This is the recommended value for SSH, but in case you need to overwrite the file, you will need to give also write permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem`.\n\n\nBefore using the newly created key, you should protect it with a passphrase:\n\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem\nssh-keygen -p\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
