The image file is\n*immutable*, meaning that it can not be modified after the build step. It is\nalso possible to create\n[writable sandbox directories](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/build_a_container.html#creating-writable-sandbox-directories)\nthat can be used for testing (and can be subsequently converted into Apptainer\nimages).\n\n## Running a container\n\nThere are a couple of ways to run Apptainer containers in CSC's computing\nenvironment. For detailed instructions, visit our documentation on\n[running containers](../../computing/containers/run-existing.md).\n\nThe options include using:\n\n* `apptainer exec`\n* `apptainer_wrapper exec` (wrapper script that binds commonly used local\n  folders, e.g. `$TMPDIR`)\n\nMany of the containers available in CSC's computing environment come with\nwrappers for selected commands, enabling them to be executed without a need for\nthe above. It is also possible to prepare wrappers for containers built from\nscratch, although this requires some familiarity with writing Bash scripts. We\ndo also provide a\n[container wrapper tool \"Tykky\"](../../computing/containers/tykky.md) that can\nbe used to easily containerize and create wrappers for Python environments.\n\n## Moving containers to CSC's computing environment\n\n### Puhti, Mahti and LUMI\n\nApptainer image files can be transferred to Puhti, Mahti or LUMI using e.g.\n[`scp`, `rsync` or a graphical file transfer tool](../../data/moving/index.md).\n\n### CSC Sensitive Data Desktop\n\nIf you wish to use a custom-built container on the\n[CSC Sensitive Data Desktop](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md), first\ntransfer the image file to Puhti. Then, follow our guidelines on\n[using Allas to move containers to the SD Desktop](../../data/sensitive-data/sd-desktop-singularity.md).\n\n## More information\n\n* [Working with containers in CSC's computing environment](../../computing/containers/overview.md)\n* [Creating containers with Tykky](../../computing/containers/tykky.md)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer is a container technology that allows for the creation of immutable container images and writable sandbox directories for testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides a computing environment where Apptainer containers can be run, including detailed documentation and tools for container management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is one of the computing environments to which Apptainer image files can be transferred)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is one of the computing environments to which Apptainer image files can be transferred)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>LUMI is one of the computing environments to which Apptainer image files can be transferred)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform provided by CSC for using custom-built containers with sensitive data, requiring transfer of image files to Puhti first)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A container wrapper tool provided by CSC to easily containerize and create wrappers for Python environments)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>CSC<|>CSC's computing environment supports running Apptainer containers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA DESKTOP<|>PUHTI<|>Custom-built containers for the CSC Sensitive Data Desktop need to be transferred to Puhti first<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY<|>CSC<|>Tykky is a tool provided by CSC for container management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA DESKTOP<|>Apptainer containers can be used on the CSC Sensitive Data Desktop<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>PUHTI<|>Apptainer image files can be transferred to Puhti for use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>MAHTI<|>Apptainer image files can be transferred to Mahti for use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>LUMI<|>Apptainer image files can be transferred to LUMI for use<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
