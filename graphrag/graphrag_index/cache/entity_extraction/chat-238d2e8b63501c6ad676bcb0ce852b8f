It is part of our [Machine learning\nguide](ml-guide.md).\n\n## Where to store data?\n\nCSC's supercomputers have three types of shared disk areas: **home**,\n**projappl** and **scratch**. You can [read more about the disk areas\nhere](../../computing/disk.md). For [LUMI check the data storage\nsection here](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/). In\ngeneral, keep your code and software in **projappl** and datasets,\nlogs and calculation outputs in **scratch**. The **home** directory is\nnot intended for data analysis and computing, and you should only\nstore small personal files there.\n\nIn addition, [LUMI has a shared **flash** storage\narea](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/) which is faster to\naccess than scratch. Flash is meant only for temporary storing the\ndata for processing, and the [flash area has higher cost than using\nnormal scratch\nstorage](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/lumi_env/billing/#flash-storage-lumi-f-billing).\n\nIt is recommended to store big datasets in the [Allas object\nstore](../../data/Allas/index.md), and download them to your project's\nscratch directory prior to starting your computation. For example:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf\ncd /scratch/<your-project>\nswift download <bucket-name> your-dataset.tar\n```\n\nAnything that needs to be stored for a longer time (project life-time)\nshould be copied back to Allas. The [scratch disk area will be\nregularly cleaned of old files](clean-up-data.md), and should not be used to store\nanything important long-term.\n\nSome CPU nodes and all GPU nodes on Puhti and Mahti (but *not* LUMI)\nalso have fast local NVMe drives with at least 3.6 TB disk space. This\nspace is available only during the execution of the Slurm job, and is\ncleaned up afterwards. For data intensive jobs it is often worthwhile\nto copy the data to the NVMe at the start of the job and then to store\nthe final results on the scratch drive at the end of the job. [See\nbelow for more information on how to use the fast local NVMe\ndrive](#fast-local-drive).\n\n\n## Using the shared file system efficiently\n\nThe training data for machine learning models often consists of a huge number of\nfiles. A typical example is training a neural network with tens of thousands of\nrelatively small JPEG image files. Unfortunately the Lustre file system used in\n`/scratch`, `/projappl` and users' home directories does not perform\nwell with random access of a lot of files or when performing many\nsmall reads. In addition to slowing down the computation it may also\nin extreme cases **cause noticeable slowdowns for all users of the\nsupercomputer, sometimes making the entire supercomputer unusable for\nhours**.\n\n!!! note\n\n    Please **do not read a huge number of files from the shared file system**.\n    Use the fast local drives or package your data into larger files\n    for sequential access instead!\n\nFor further reading, see CSC's [technical description of the Lustre\nfilesystem](../../computing/lustre.md) and our general tutorial on [how to\nachieve better I/O performance on Lustre](lustre_performance.md).\n\n\n### More efficient data format\n\nMany machine learning frameworks support formats for packaging your\ndata more efficiently. Common formats include [TensorFlow's\nTFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord) and\n[WebDataset](https://webdataset.github.io/webdataset/) for PyTorch.\nOther examples include using\n[HDF5](https://towardsdatascience.com/hdf5-datasets-for-pytorch-631ff1d750f5),\nor [LMDB](http://deepdish.io/2015/04/28/creating-lmdb-in-python/)\nformats, or even humble ZIP-files, e.g., via Python's\n[zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) library.\nSee also [an example of creating TFRecord files from an image\ndataset](https://github.com/CSCfi/machine-learning-scripts/blob/master/notebooks/tf2-pets-create-tfrecords.ipynb).\n\nThe main point with all of these formats is that instead of many\nthousands of small files you have one or a few bigger files, which are\nmuch more efficient to access and read sequentially. Don't hesitate to\n[contact our service desk](../contact.md) if you need advice about how\nto access your data more efficiently.\n\n\n### Fast local drive (Puhti and Mahti only)\n\nIf you really need to access the individual small files, you can use\nthe fast NVMe local drive that is present in GPU nodes on Puhti and\nMahti. In brief, you just need to add `nvme:<number-of-GB>` to the\n`--gres` flag in your submission script, and then the fast local\nstorage will be available in the location specified by the environment\nvariable `$LOCAL_SCRATCH`. Here is an example run that reserves 100 GB\nof the fast local drive and extracts the dataset tar-package on that\ndrive before launching the computation:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --partition=gpu\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10\n#SBATCH --mem=64G\n#SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n#SBATCH --\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
