An interactive batch job for testing Prokka can be started\nwith the command:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive -i -m 8G\n```\n\nTo activate Prokka environment, run the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load prokka\n```\n\nAfter that you can launch Prokka with the command `prokka`. By default, Prokka tries to use 8 computing cores, but in \nthis interactive batch job case, you have just one core available. Therefore, you should always define the number\nof cores that Prokka will use with option `-cpus`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nprokka --cpus 1 contigs.fasta\n```\n\nLarger analyses should be executed as a batch job utilizing several cores.\nA sample batch job script (`batch_job_file.bash`) is provided below:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=prokka\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --mem=16000\n#SBATCH --account=your_project_name\n\n#set up prokka\nmodule load prokka\n\n#Run prokka\nprokka --cpus $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --outdir results_case1 --prefix mygenome contigs_case1.fa\n```\n\nIn the batch job example above one Prokka task (`--ntasks=1`) is executed. \nThe job reserves 8 cores (`--cpus-per-task=8`) with total of 16 GB of memory (`--mem=16000`). \nThe maximum duration of the job is 24 hours (`--time 24:00:00`). All the cores are assigned from \none computing node (`--nodes=1`). In addition to the resource reservations, you have to define \nthe billing project for your batch job. This is done by replacing `your_project_name` with \nthe name of your project. You can use command `csc-projects` to see what CSC projects you have access to.\n\nYou can submit the batch job file to the batch job system with the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file.bash\n```\n\nSee the [Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md) for more information about running batch jobs.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Prokka home page](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
