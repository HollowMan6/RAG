The LUMI-C nodes (CPU) are equipped with a\nsingle endpoint while the LUMI-G nodes (GPU nodes) have 4 endpoints - one for\neach AMD MI250x GPU modules. Each endpoint provides up to 50 GB/s of\nbidirectional bandwidth. The HPE Cray Slingshot NIC features high-performance\nRDMA and hardware acceleration for MPI and SHMEM based software.\n\n## Topology\n\nLUMI uses the dragonfly network topology. In this topology, a group of endpoints, \nfor example the compute nodes, are connected to a switch. Multiple switches \nconnected in an all-to-all fashion to create a group. This group is sometimes \nreferred to as an electrical group as these switches can be connected by short \ncopper cables. The electrical groups are then connected to each other in an\nall-to-all fashion. Optical cables are used for group-to-group communication\nas distances are much larger. The figure below presents a graphical representation\nof a dragonfly topology.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/dragonfly-overview.svg\" \n    width=\"750\"\n    alt=\"Example dragonfly topology\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Example dragonfly topology.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn summary, the LUMI network dragonfly can be summarized as these three ranks:\n\n- **Rank 1:** multiple compute nodes connected to a switch\n- **Rank 2:** multiple switches all-to-all connected with copper cables forming\n  an electrical group\n- **Rank 3:** multiple electrical groups all-to-all connected with optical cables\n\nThe dragonfly topology allows for communication to be performed in a maximum of \n3 switch hops: one hop inside the source group, one hop between the group and one \nhop inside the destination group.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/network-hops.svg\" \n    width=\"700\"\n    alt=\"Communication switch hops\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Switch hops from source to destination</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Inter- and intra-partition bandwidth\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the total available bandwidth for inter-\nand intra-partition communication.\n\n|        | LUMI-G   | LUMI-C    | LUMI-M   | LUMI-F   | LUMI-P   |\n|--------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| LUMI-G | 276 TB/s | 38.4 TB/s | 2.4 TB/s | 7.2 TB/s | 9.6 TB/s |\n| LUMI-C |          | 22.4 TB/s | 0.8 TB/s | 3.2 TB/s | 3.2 TB/s |\n| LUMI-M |          |           |          | 0.1 TB/s | 0.4 TB/s |\n| LUMI-F |          |           |          |          | 0.4 TB/s |\n\nThe different partitions presented in the table correspond to\n\n  - **LUMI-G:** the AMD MI250x GPU nodes\n  - **LUMI-C:** the CPU nodes\n  - **LUMI-M:** the login nodes, LUMI-D, the largemem nodes and the management racks\n  - **LUMI-P:** the four Lustre filesystems using mechanical disk\n  - **LUMI-F:** the Lustre filesystem using Flash-based storage\n\n## LUMI-C\n\nLUMI-C, the CPU partition, has 8 electrical groups of 256 nodes.
