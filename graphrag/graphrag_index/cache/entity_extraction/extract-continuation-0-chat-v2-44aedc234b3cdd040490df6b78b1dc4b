The memory\n    used for `/tmp` is included in the job memory allocation. If you use\n    `/tmp`, you must allocate memory for it to avoid running out of\n    memory.\n\n## Pipelining with dependencies\n\nJob dependencies allow you to defer the start of a job until the specified\ndependencies have been satisfied. Dependencies can be defined in a batch script\nwith the `--dependency` directive or be passed as a command-line argument to\n`sbatch`.\n\n```bash\n$ sbatch --dependency=<type:job_id[:job_id]>\n```\n\nThe `type` defines the condition that the job with ID `job_id` must fulfil\nbefore the job which depends on it can start. For example,\n\n```bash\n$ sbatch job1.sh\nSubmitted batch job 123456\n\n$ sbatch --dependency=afterany:123456 job2.sh\nSubmitted batch job 123458\n```\n\nwill only start execution of `job2.sh` when `job1.sh` has finished. The available\ntypes and their description are presented in the table below.\n\n| Dependency type               | Description                                           |\n| ------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| `after:jobid[:jobid...]`      | Begin after the specified jobs have started           |\n| `afterany:jobid[:jobid...]`   | Begin after the specified jobs have finished          |\n| `afternotok:jobid[:jobid...]` | Begin after the specified jobs have failed            |\n| `afterok:jobid[:jobid...]`    | Begin after the specified jobs have run to completion |\n\nThe example below demonstrates a bash script for submission of multiple Slurm\nbatch jobs with dependencies. It also shows an example of a helper function\nthat extracts the job ID from the output of the `sbatch` command.  \n\n``` bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsubmit_job() {\n  sub=\"$(sbatch \"$@\")\"\n  \n  if [[ \"$sub\" =~ Submitted\\ batch\\ job\\ ([0-9]+) ]]; then\n    echo \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"\n  else\n    exit 1\n  fi\n}\n\n# first job - no dependencies\nid1=$(submit_job job1.sh)\n\n# Two jobs that depend on the first job\nid2=$(submit_job --dependency=afterany:$id1 job2.sh)\nid3=$(submit_job --dependency=afterany:$id1 job3.sh)\n\n# One job that depends on both the second and the third jobs\nid4=$(submit_job  --dependency=afterany:$id2:$id3 job4.sh)\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager designed for Linux clusters of any size, used to allocate computational resources to users for job execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BASH is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOB1.SH<|>EVENT<|>A bash script submitted as the first job in a sequence of dependent jobs in a SLURM managed cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOB2.SH<|>EVENT<|>A bash script submitted as a dependent job that runs after job1.sh in a SLURM managed cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOB3.SH<|>EVENT<|>A bash script submitted as a dependent job that runs after job1.sh in a SLURM managed cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOB4.SH<|>EVENT<|>A bash script submitted as a dependent job that runs after job2.sh and job3.sh in a SLURM managed cluster)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOB2.SH<|>JOB1.SH<|>Job2.sh execution depends on the completion of job1.sh<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOB3.SH<|>JOB1.SH<|>Job3.sh execution depends on the completion of job1.sh<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOB4.SH<|>JOB2.SH<|>Job4.sh execution depends on the completion of job2.sh<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOB4.SH<|>JOB3.SH<|>Job4.sh execution depends on the completion of job3.sh<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
