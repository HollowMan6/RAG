However, \nas SD Desktop virtual machines don't have internet connection, you can't run `pip install` command in the way it is normally used.\n\n**If you plan to use a complex python environment in SD Desktop, the best solution is to build an Apptainer container that \nincludes all the Python libraries you need, and import the container to SD Desktop**.\n\nHowever, if you need to add just few missing libraries, you could create a Python virtual environment\nto add the missing libraries. This tutorial demonstrates two ways to add missing Python libraries to the existing Python environment in SD desktop. As an example Python library we use [SciKit-Optimize library](https://scikit-optimize.github.io).\n\n## Option 1: add-python-lib tool\n\n_Add-python-lib_ is a help tool tha can be used to add python libraries to\na Python virtual environment in a SD Desktop virtual machine.\nThis tool can be added to your virtual machine with the [SD Sotware installer tool](./sd-software-installer.md).\n\nBasic syntax of the command is:\n\n```text\nadd-python-lib search_term \n```\n\nThe command looks for matching packages from the set of Python libraries that CSC has preloaded to SD Connect.\nNote that the preloaded set of libraries is very small (some hundreds) compared to the over 300 000 libraries available through pip.\nPlease send a request to _servicedesk@csc.fi_ if you would need to have a library to be added to the selection.\nNote that all python libraries are not compatible with this approach.\n\nThe selected library will added to a Python virtual environment that locates in _/shared-directory/sd-tools/python3-venv_.\nThis virtual environment is automatically created when _add-python-lib_ is used for the first time.\n\nIn the case of SciKit-Optimize, you could do the installation with command:\n\n```text\nadd-python-lib scikit \n```\n\nor \n\n```text\nadd-python-lib scikit_optimize \n```\n\nNote that search term _SciKit-Optimize_ would not find any matching libraries as the search process is based on\nthe names of pip installation files, that use only small case letters and where dashes (-) are replaced with under scores (_).\n\nIf the search term you used, matches several Python libraries, the tool shows you a list of libraries from which you can\nchoose the library to be installed. \n\nAfter that, the tool asks, if also the dependencies of the selected library should be installed.\nNormally you should try to install the dependencies too. \n\nOnce the installation is ready, you can switch to use the Python virtual environment with commands:\n\n```text\nsource /shared-directory/sd-tools/python3-venv/bin/activate\nexport PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages\n```\n\n\n## Option 2: Importing the module through SD Connect\n\n### 1. Downloading installation file for SD Desktop\n\nThe first thing to do is to download a pip installation package file for the library you want to use.\nThis you must do outside SD Desktop. You can search for the package from the [Pypi repository](https://pypi.org/)\nor use _pip download_ command if you have python3 installed in your machine (if possible, use Python version that matches with the Python version in SD Desktop).\n\n#### 1.1 Pypi repository \n\nIn the case of SciKit-Optimize, search in the Pypi repository gives you a project list. SciKit-Optimize is the first item  on the list. You can continue to the  SciKit-Optimize project page, where the _download_ link provides a list of downloadable files. Here we could download the pre-build library file (scikit_optimize-0.10.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl ).\n\n#### 1.2  pip in command line\n\nIn your local machine, create a new directory, use `pip download` to download the installation files and then package \nthis directory for transportation. In the case of user _asund_ in a Linux or Mac, _SciKit-Optimize_ library could be packaged \nwith commands:\n\n```bash\nmkdir scikit-optimize\npip download scikit-optimize -d \"/home/asund/scikit-optimize\"\ntar cvfz scikit-optimize.tgz scikit-optimize\n```\n\n#### 1.3 Upload \n\nNext you should upload the installation package (`scikit_optimize-0.10.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl` or `scikit-optimize.tgz`) to one of \nyour data buckets in [SD Connect](https://sd-connect.csc.fi).\n\n### 2. Installing the library\n\nAfter uploading the installation package to SD Connect, you will do rest of the installation steps\nin your SD Desktop environment.\n\n1. Open terminal session and create a Python virtual environment with command\n(this needs to be done only once):\n\n    ```bash\n    python3 -m venv $HOME/my-python\n    ```\n\n2. Activate your Python virtual environment and add the location of default python libraries to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
