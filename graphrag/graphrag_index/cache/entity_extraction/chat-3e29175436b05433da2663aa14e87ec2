For example, with\nthe GNU compiler:\n\n```\ngcc -g -o example example.c\n```\n\n\n## Memory leaks\n\nA good place to start is to check for memory leaks with\n[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/). It is a versatile tool that is most\ncommonly used to detect memory leaks in the code, but can also be used e.g. to\ndetect errors in threading or to investigate heap and cache usage.\n\nIn order to use Valgrind, set up the environment as needed normally by your\ncode and re-compile the code with the debug flag (`-g`) added.\n\nRunning an analysis with Valgrind is simple and can be done either in an\n[interactive session](running/interactive-usage.md) or as a\n[submitted job](running/submitting-jobs.md). In an interactive session the\ncommand to use is `valgrind ./myprogram`, while in a submitted job the\ncommand is `srun valgrind ./myprogram`.\n\nFor example, to check for memory leaks in an interactive session:\n\n```bash\nmodule load valgrind\n\nvalgrind ./example\n```\n\nTo run the same analysis as a normal non-interactive job, e.g. when debugging\na parallel program, the command to use is `srun valgrind ./example`.\n\n\n## Debuggers\n\nFully-fledged debuggers are often needed to really dig into the code execution\nand to resolve runtime errors. At CSC, several debuggers are available:\n\n* [Arm DDT](../apps/ddt.md) is a debugger for serial and parallel programs\n  (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA) with both graphical and command-line interfaces\n* [GDB](gdb.md) is a command-line debugger for compiled programs (C, C++,\n  Fortran, etc.)\n* [PDB](pdb.md) is an interactive debugger for Python programs\n* [CUDA-GDB](cuda-gdb.md) is a command-line debugger for CUDA programs\n* [compute-sanitizer](compute-san.md) is a command-line functional correctness checking suite\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
