Working efficiently with data\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 4\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/data-io/io-exercise-fastdisks.html\n---\n\n# How to run I/O intensive computing tasks efficiently?\n\n## Background\n\n‚òùüèª Lustre-based project-specific directories `/scratch` and `/projappl` can\nstore large amounts of data and are accessible to all compute nodes of Puhti.\nHowever, these directories are not good for managing numerous files or\nperforming intensive input/output (I/O) operations. If you need to work with a\nhuge number of smaller files or perform frequent reads/writes, you should\nconsider using the NVMe-based local temporary scratch directories, either\nthrough normal or interactive batch jobs.\n\nüí° Read more about the advantages of using the local scratch disk in\n[Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/local_scratch_for_data_processing/).\n\n## Convert the following regular batch job script into one that uses local scratch for faster I/O\n\nüí¨ Below is a normal batch job script that pulls a docker image from DockerHub\nand converts it into an Apptainer image that is compatible with HPC\nenvironments such as CSC supercomputers Puhti and Mahti. During the conversion\nprocess, several layers are retrieved, cached and then converted into an \nApptainer `.sif` image file.\n\n1. Copy the script above to a file (e.g. `batch_job.sh`) and modify it\n   accordingly.\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   #SBATCH --account=<project>                          # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n   #SBATCH --time=01:00:00                              # Maximum duration of the job. Upper limit depends on the partition. \n   #SBATCH --partition=small                            # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, hugemem_longrun\n   #SBATCH --mem=10G                                    # Reserve memory\n   \n   export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>/$USER     # Use these folders instead of the default $HOME\n   export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/scratch/<project>/$USER   # $HOME has less space and you hate cleaning, don't you?\n   \n   apptainer pull --name trinity.simg docker://trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq\n   ```\n\n2. You can then submit the script file to a compute node using the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sbatch batch_job.sh\n   ```\n\nüí≠ **How long did it take to finish the job? What about when using NVMe?**\n\n#### Hints\n\n- If you first ran the default script (above), then you need to clear the cache\n  before running the next one.\n- Request fast local storage using the `--gres` flag in the `#SBATCH` directive\n  as follows:\n\n  ```bash\n  #SBATCH --gres=nvme:<local_storage_space_per_node_in_GB> \n  ```\n\n- E.g., to request 200 GB of fast disk space, use:\n\n  ```bash\n  #SBATCH --gres=nvme:200\n  ```\n\n- Use the environment variable `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` to access the local storage on\n  each compute node.\n- **Important!** After you've processed the data on the fast local disk,\n  remember to move it back to the shared disk area (`/scratch`), otherwise the\n  data will be lost!\n- Solution for script:\n\n  ```bash\n  #!/bin/bash\n  #SBATCH --account=<project>                           # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n  #SBATCH --time=01:00:00                               # Maximum duration of the job.
