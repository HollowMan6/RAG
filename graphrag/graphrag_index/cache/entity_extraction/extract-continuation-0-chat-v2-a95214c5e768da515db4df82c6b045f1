See [here](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/R/allas/working_with_allas_from_R_S3.R) for a practical example involving raster data. \n\nAccessing Allas via the `r-env` module can be done as follows. First configure Allas by running these commands before launching an interactive shell session:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf --mode s3cmd\n```\n\nAfter [starting an interactive session and launching R / RStudio Server](#interactive-use-on-a-compute-node), you can now access your bucket list as follows. Note that, for this to work, you will need to have the `allas` module loaded and the argument `region=''` added to the `bucketlist()` function:\n\n```r\nlibrary(aws.s3)\nbucketlist(region='')\n```\n\n## Citation\n\nFor finding out the correct citations for R and different R packages, you can type:\n\n```r\ncitation() # for citing R\ncitation(\"package\") # for citing R packages\n```\n\n## Further information\n\n- [r-env container recipes](https://github.com/CSCfi/singularity-recipes/tree/main/r-env-singularity) (link to public GitHub repository)\n\n- [Tutorial on parallel R](../support/tutorials/parallel-r.md)\n\n- [R FAQs](https://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html) (hosted by CRAN)\n\n- [Related Projects](https://www.r-project.org/other-projects.html) (list of R-related projects on R Project website)\n\n- [R package cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (hosted on RStudio website)\n\n- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (pre-installed on the `r-env` module)\n\n- [doMPI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doMPI/index.html), [future](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html), [furrr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/furrr/index.html), [lidR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/index.html), [pbdMPI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdMPI/index.html), [snow](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snow/index.html) (CRAN pages for parallel R packages)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>R MARKDOWN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software tool for dynamic document generation that integrates with R)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUARTO DOCUMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publishing system that supports reproducible workflows, integrating with R and other languages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TINYTEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A lightweight, easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage system that can be accessed directly from R scripts, supporting S3 storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS.S3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package that facilitates working with S3 storage, including Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R-ENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R module that comes with various packages for data analysis, including aws.s3 for accessing S3 storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSTUDIO SERVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An integrated development environment for R, accessible via web browser)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Comprehensive R Archive Network, a repository of R packages and software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIDYVERSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A collection of R packages designed for data science)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for parallel computing using MPI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for asynchronous programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FURRR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package that provides tools for applying functions in parallel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIDR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) data manipulation and visualization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PBDMPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for programming with big data in R using MPI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for simple network of workstations, providing high-level functions for parallel computing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWS.S3<|>ALLAS<|>The aws.s3 package is used for accessing Allas storage system from R scripts<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R-ENV<|>AWS.S3<|>The r-env module includes the aws.s3 package for working with S3 storage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R-ENV<|>TIDYVERSE<|>The tidyverse collection of R packages is pre-installed on the r-env module<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R<|>CRAN<|>CRAN is the official repository for R packages and software<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSTUDIO SERVER<|>R<|>RStudio Server provides an IDE for the R programming language<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
