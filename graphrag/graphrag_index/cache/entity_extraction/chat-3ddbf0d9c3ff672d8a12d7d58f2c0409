Identify all entities.

The inverse situation where the bucket is not readable but the objects are is\nsimilar to a UNIX directory with only executable permissions and no read permissions. I.e\nfiles / object can be retrieved from the directory / bucket, but it's not possible to list the content.\n\nTo remove the public access you would run:\n\n```bash\ns3cmd setacl --recursive --acl-private s3://<bucket_name>\n```\n\nor \n\n```bash\naws s3api put-bucket-acl  --acl private --bucket <bucket_name>\naws s3api put-object-acl --acl  private --bucket <bucket_name> --key <object_name> \n```\nAgain `put-object-acl` has to be run separately for each object.\n\nwhile,\n```bash\ns3cmd setacl --recursive --acl-grant=read:'<proj_id>$<proj_id>' s3://<bucket_name>/\n```\n\nWould grant read access to all objects in the `<bucket_name>` bucket for the `<proj_id>` project. \nThe single quotes are important as otherwise the shell might interpret `$<proj_id>` as an (empty) variable\nThe corresponding command for `aws s3api` would be:\n\n```bash\naws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> --grant-read id='<proj_id>$<proj_id>'\naws s3api put-object-acl --grant-read id='<proj_id>$<proj_id>' --bucket <bucket_name> --key <object_name> \n```\n\nThe lumi-pub rlcone remotes configured by lumio-conf uses acl settings to make\ncreated objects and buckets public, and the same goes for `s3cmd put -P`\nSo if you need to \"unpublish\" or \"publish\" some data you can use the above commands\n\n!!! warning\n\tPermissions granted with `--acl-grant` are not revoked automatically when running `--acl-private`\n\tand they have to be explicitly removed with `--acl-revoke`\n\n!!! important\n\tAfter modifying ACL:s, always verify that the intended effect was achieved.\n\tI.e check that things which should be private are private and that public objects\n\tand buckets are accessible without authentication. Public buckets / objects are available using the url  \n\t`https://<proj_id>.lumidata.eu/<bucket>/<object>`, use e.g `wget`, `curl` or a browser to check the access permissions. \n\t\n\nThe `aws` cli has a larger selection of acl settings than `s3cmd`, e.g\n\n```bash\naws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> --acl authenticated-read\n```\n\nCan be used to grant read-only access to **all** authenticated users of LUMI-O.\nUseful if data is semi-public but for some reason or another only\npeople with lumi access. Note here that we are only granting read access to the bucket itself\nnot any of the objects. \n\nTo view existing ACL:s you can use \n\n```\ns3cmd info s3://<bucket_name>/<optional_object_name>\n```\n\nor\n\n```\naws s3api get-bucket-acl  --bucket <bucket_name>\naws s3api get-object-acl  --bucket <bucket_name> --key <object_name> \n```\n\nSee the [s3cmd documentation](https://s3tools.org/usage) and [aws s3api documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-object-acl.html#options) for a full list of ACLs.\n\n\n### Sharing data with other projects.\n\n\nThe authentication information used when interacting with LUMI-O\npartially defines the scope for buckets.\n\nPublic buckets/objects for a project are located under\n\n`https://<proj_id>.lumidata.eu/<bucket>/<object>`\n\n\nBut making the request to the same url while authenticated will\ntry to fetch `<bucket>` from your own project not `proj_id`. \n\nInstead the format `https://lumidata.eu/<proj_id>:<bucket>/<object>`\nmust be used.\n\nFor public objects the above two URLs are equivalent. \nNote that the authorization header of any request is checked before any access rules are \nverified -> using invalid credentials will lead to an\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
