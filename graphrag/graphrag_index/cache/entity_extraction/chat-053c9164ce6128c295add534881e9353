In this case we wish to install the software under the `version-14-137`\n   directory in your `$PROJAPPL` area. Thus, you need to specify the custom\n   location for the installation using the `--prefix` option:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --prefix=$PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137  # double check that the path is correct\n   ```\n\n3. Compile and install the software with the commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   make\n   make install\n   ```\n\n   ‚òùüèª If you intend to compile software packages larger than the rather small MCL\n   example used here, please use the fast local disk (`$TMPDIR`) to avoid\n   stressing the parallel file system. Compiling complex applications typically\n   cause a lot of I/O load.\n\n4. If the `make` and `make install` commands don't give any error messages, you\n   have successfully installed your own software!\n\n   üí≠ Typically, the executables/binaries, i.e. the compiled programs that can\n   be launched, are stored in a subdirectory called `bin`.\n\n5. Check what binaries were installed with:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls $PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137/bin\n   ```\n\n## Running the software\n\nüí¨ Although the software is now ready to be run, it is not automatically added\nto your `$PATH`. This means that running:\n\n```bash\nmcl --help\n```\n\nwill give an error message `bash: mcl: command not found`.\n\nüí¨ You need to tell the computer where to find that command.\n\n1. Try running the software by providing the full path to the binary, i.e.:\n\n   ```bash\n   $PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137/bin/mcl --help\n   ```\n\n2. Add the path of the MCL executables to your `$PATH` environment variable.\n   This is done with the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=$PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137/bin:$PATH  # double check that this path matches your actual installation path\n   ```\n\n   ‚ÄºÔ∏è When running `export`, note that the variable we are defining (first\n   `PATH`) should *not* have a dollar sign. Also, note that we include the\n   current `$PATH` at the end (*with* a dollar sign).\n\n   ‚òùüèª If we omit the current path, the normal shell commands will stop working!\n\n3. Now you can launch the program you have installed from anywhere without\n   first going to the `bin` directory or specifying the full path:\n\n   ```bash\n   mcl --help\n   ```\n\nüí¨ Remember that the `PATH` variable must be set each time you log in to the\nsupercomputer before you can run the `mcl` command without providing the full\npath.\n\n‚òùüèª You need to run the correct `export PATH=...` command also in batch job\nfiles before launching self-installed programs without the full path.\n\nüí° If you want to make the addition automatically, add the `export PATH=...`\ncommand to your `.bashrc` file in your `$HOME` directory.\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Making changes to the `.bashrc` file may cause incompatibilities with\nsoftware installed by CSC.\n\nüí≠ If you wish to revert your `.bashrc` file (and your environment in general)\nback to default, you can use the\n[csc-env command](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/).\n\nüí° Note that loading modules installed by CSC will automatically modify your\n`$PATH` as needed, so no exports are typically required if you only run\npre-installed applications.\n\n## Cleaning up\n\n- If the software you have installed works correctly, you can remove the\n  installation package and temporary directories that were used during the\n  compilation.\n- In this case we can remove the `mcl-latest.tar.gz` package and the whole\n  `mcl-14-137` directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd $PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl\n   rm mcl-latest.tar.gz\n   rm -r mcl-14-137\n   ```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
