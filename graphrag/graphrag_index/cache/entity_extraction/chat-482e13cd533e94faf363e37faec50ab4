Every project consumes billing units. Using SD Connect and SD Desktop is free of charge for research purposes, according to CSC's [general terms of use](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases).\n\nWhen you start a new project, you should plan ahead for your CSC project's resource usage. This includes considering the amount of storage space (i.e. quota) and billing units consumption while using the services. When you start a new project with CSC, you receive 10,000 billing units by default. This is enough for small testing. However, you should estimate how many BUâ€™s your project will consume **during 1 year** and apply more if needed. You can apply more billing units trough MyCSC resource application. Read more: [applying for billing units](../../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md) and [increasing quotas](../../accounts/how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md#increasing-the-storage-capacity-in-allas).\n\n* Use [billing unit calculator](#billing-unit-calculator-for-estimating-billing-units-consumption) to estimate how many BUs your CSC project will require. \n\n### Billing units and storage space in SD Connect\n\nSD Connect stores data to [Allas](../Allas/index.md). Default storage space for SD Connect/Allas is 10 TB, which you can expand up to 200 TB as needed. If you need even more storage capacity, please contact [service desk](../../support/contact.md) *(subject: Increase Allas quota)*. \n\nStoring data in SD Connect/Allas consumes billing units at a rate of **1 billing unit per TB per hour**. This means that storing 1 TB of data in SD Connect/Allas consumes 24 billing units daily and 8760 billing units annually.\n\n### Billing units and disk space in SD Desktop\n\nAnalyzing data in SD Desktop consumes billing units based on the type of virtual desktop used. Each virtual desktop can also have a volume (also called disk space), where files can be imported from SD Connect/SD Apply. The volume can be added only during desktop creation (up to 200 GB). If you need larger volume please contact [service desk](../../support/contact.md) *(subject: Sensitive data)*. \n\n\nThe rates are as follows:\n\n* Small computation: 5.2 billing units per hour\n* Medium computation: 10.4 billing units per hour\n* Heavy computation: 52 billing units per hour\n\n## What happens if your project runs out of billing units?\n\nOnce all the billing units for your CSC project have been used up, **your access to the SD Desktop service will be restricted**. This means that all virtual desktops currently running will automatically be paused, and you won't be able to access their content. However, **your data remains unaffected and will not be deleted**, even in cases where the total billing units reach zero or enter negative values.\n\n!!! Note \n    * You will get a notification via email when your billing units have been consumed. \n    * Please apply more billing units for your project in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/login){ target=\"_blank\" }.\n  \n\n## Billing unit calculator for estimating billing units consumption\n\nBilling unit calculator will help you to estimate how many BUs your CSC project will require during one year. You can estimate SD Connect billing unit consumption by using **Allas** option in the calculator.\n\n<iframe srcdoc=\"https://my.csc.fi/buc\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 1300px; border: 0\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n## Closing CSC project\n\nDefault lifetime for the project is **one year**. Project manager can extend project's lifetime or close the project in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi){ target=\"_blank\" }. If project lifetime ends, it will be closed automatically. You'll receive an email notification when your project is about to expire, so please keep your contact information up to date in MyCSC.\n\n[More about project closure](../../accounts/how-to-manage-your-project.md#project-closure)\n\n### What happens to your data after the CSC project expires or is closed\n\n* **Services will be disabled**: SD Connect and SD Desktop services will be disabled, and you won't be able to access them anymore.\n\n* **Data will be deleted after 90 days**: Any data stored within SD Connect or SD Desktop, including files, virtual desktops, and volumes, will be permanently removed after 90 days from the project's closure. This measure is in place to ensure the secure handling of your data, aligning with CSC's policies.\n\n!!! Note\n    You will get a notification via email when your project is about to expire. All **content within the services will be permanently deleted 90\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
