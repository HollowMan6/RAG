The installation procedure will vary based on your specific\napplication. There are, however, some general rules you should be mindful of:\n\n- You cannot use `sudo`, i.e. typical `sudo apt` or `sudo yum` commands you might find\n  online will not work on CSC supercomputers.\n- You cannot install into \"standard\" system locations, e.g. `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib` etc.\n  Instead, the best location for your own installations is the `/projappl` directory of\n  your project.\n- Use the fast local disk `$TMPDIR` when compiling to avoid stressing the parallel file\n  system. Compiling applications typically cause quite a bit of I/O load.\n- Many software might require some dependencies, e.g. [HPC libraries](hpc-libraries.md)\n  such as FFTW or ScaLAPACK. Note that many of these are available as pre-installed\n  modules, so you may not need to install *everything* from scratch.\n- New software are not automatically added to your `$PATH`. To access the software,\n  either provide the full path or add with `export PATH=/path/to/my/app/bin:$PATH`.\n\n!!! info \"Help is available!\"\n    Don't hesitate to contact [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md) if you\n    encounter issues with installing your own software.\n\n## Native installations\n\nNative installations refer to applications that are installed directly to the system.\nTypically, one downloads the source code of the software, compiles the code, and installs\nto a location where the user has write-access, e.g. the project's `/projappl` directory.\nNative installation from source code might sometimes be the only way to install an\napplication, and is recommended especially for software with few or no dependencies.\n\n### Compiling\n\nHPC software written using programming languages such as C, C++ or Fortran need to be\ncompiled before installing. Guidelines on compiling software on CSC supercomputers can\nbe found from the links below. A list of available HPC libraries that may need to be\nlinked upon compiling is also provided.\n\n- [Compiling on Puhti](compiling-puhti.md)\n- [Compiling on Mahti](compiling-mahti.md)\n- [Compiling on LUMI](compiling-lumi.md)\n- [HPC libraries](hpc-libraries.md)\n\n### Spack\n\n[Spack](https://spack.io) is a flexible package manager that can be used to install\nsoftware on supercomputers and Linux and macOS systems. The basic module tree including\ncompilers, MPI libraries and many of the available software on CSC supercomputers have\nbeen installed using Spack. Spack is similar to the [EasyBuild package manager extensively\nused on LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/easybuild/).\n\nCSC provides user Spack modules on Puhti and Mahti that can be used to build software on top of the\navailable compilers and libraries. It is also possible to install different customized versions of\npackages available in the module tree for special use cases. [See here for a short tutorial on how to\ninstall software on CSC supercomputers using Spack](../support/tutorials/user-spack.md). Spack is\nalso available on [LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/spack/).\n\n### Ready-made binaries\n\nReady-made binaries typically exhibit optimal performance only on the system on which\nthey have been compiled on. This applies especially for MPI codes, which should always\nbe re-compiled for best performance. However, if the binary you want to use is a simple\nserial or threaded application, you can try running it directly.\n\n## Containers\n\nContainerizing applications can be a very efficient way to install software and libraries,\nespecially if the application has complex dependencies such as most Python environments\n([see below](#pythonr-environments)). CSC supercomputers support Apptainer/Singularity\ncontainers, which are similar to Docker, but better suited for multi-user HPC systems. In\nmost cases, ready-made Docker containers can be easily converted into an Apptainer image.\nAnother option is to build your own container from scratch. More details on working with\ncontainers in CSC's computing environment can be found from the links below:\n\n- [Overview of containers](containers/overview.md)\n- [Running containers](containers/run-existing.md)\n- [Creating containers](containers/creating.md)\n- [Tykky container wrapper](containers/tykky.md)\n\n## Python/R environments\n\nBest practice guidelines on installing own Python and R packages can be found in\nthe Python, R and Tykky container wrapper pages below.\n\n- [Installing Python packages and environments](../apps/python.md)\n- [Containerizing Conda and pip environments with Tykky](containers/tykky.md)\n- [R package installations](../apps/r-env.md#r-package-installations)\n\nBriefly, individual Python packages with no/few dependencies can be installed\nalongside CSC's pre-installed Python modules with `pip install --user <package>`.\nMore complicated environments should always be containerized. This is accomplished\neasily with [Tykky](containers/tykky.md).\n\nSimilarly, the pre-installed R module provided by CSC is a containerized environment\ncontaining more than 1300 packages. If these do not suit your needs, you can install your\nown packages into a project-specific location under `/projappl` and add this to your library\ntrees in R.
