Free\n---\n\n# Structure\n\nStructure is a software package for using multi-locus genotype data to investigate population structure. \nIts uses include inferring the presence of distinct populations, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, \nidentifying migrants and admixed individuals, and estimating population allele frequencies in situations where many \nindividuals are migrants or admixed.\n\nIt can be applied to most of the commonly-used genetic markers, including SNPS, microsatellites, RFLPs and AFLPs. \n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\n- Structure is free to use and open source, but no license is specified.\n- StrAuto is free to use and open source, but no license is specified.\n- strasuto-puhti is free to use and open source, but no license is specified.\n- structureHarvester is free to use and open source under its own [License](https://github.com/dentearl/structureHarvester/blob/master/LICENSE)\n- CLUMPP is free to use, but no license is specified.\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2.3.4\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use Structure in Puhti, run first the following setup commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\nmodule load structure\n```\n\nIn addition to the `structure` command, the Structure module makes available programs [CLUMPP](https://web.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/clumpp.html) and [structureHarvester](https://github.com/dentearl/structureHarvester/) that can be used for post-processing Structure results.\n\nOn Puhti, we recommend that you submit your Structure jobs using a help tool called `strauto-puhti`.\nThis tool is a modified version of [StrAuto](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1593-0) Structure\njob submission tool. Note that many details in the StrAuto manual do not apply to `strauto-puhti`.\n\nNext, move to the scratch directory of your project. Any subdirectory inside your scratch area will do.\nFor example:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_xxxxxx/$USER\n```\n\nCreate a new empty directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir structure_job1\n```\n\nNext, you need to copy or create to this directory the two input files used by `strauto-puhti` program.\nThe parameter file must always be named as `input.py`. The name of the actual data file is defined in\n`input.py`. The data file name should end with `.str` or `.ustr`.\n\nA sample file provided by StrAuto can be copied to your current directory with the commands:\n\n```bash\ncd structure_job1\ncp /appl/soft/bio/structure/strauto/input.py ./  \ncp /appl/soft/bio/structure/strauto/sim.str ./ \n```\n\nWhen the input file has been prepared, the Structure job can be launched with the command:\n\n```bash\nstrauto-puhti\n```\n\nStrAuto first asks you to check and accept Structure parameters and after that\nsubmits the Structure job to the batch job system of Puhti. After that\nit starts monitoring the progress of your job.\n\nYou can leave the monitor process running, but if you want to stop it, press\n`Ctrl-c`.\n\nThe structure jobs will still continue their execution in the batch job system\nof Puhti. If you run the command:\n\n```bash\nstrauto-puhti\n```\n\nin the same directory again it will check the status of structure jobs and do the\npost-processing of the results if all the Structure-related tasks have finished.\n\nNote that `strauto-puhti` does not use the internal, GNU-parallel based, parallelization.\nInstead, parallelization is based on array jobs. Because of this, you should not change \nthe _parallel_ parameter value to _True_ in the structure input file. \n\n## More information\n\n* [Structure home page](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html)\n* [StrAuto home page ](https://vc.popgen.org/software/strauto/)\n* [StructureHarvester home page](https://alumni.soe.ucsc.edu/~dearl/software/structureHarvester/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
