Note however, that listing\ncommands show only buckets owned by your project. In the case of shared buckets and objects you must know the\nnames of the buckets in order to use them.\n\nIn the case of the example above, user from project _3d5b0ae8e724b439a4cd16d1290_ will not see _my_fishbucket_ , when it is shared, with command:\n\n```text\ns3cmd ls\n```\nHowever she can list the content of the bucket with command:\n```text\ns3cmd ls s3://my_fishbucket\n```\nIn the Pouta web UI, user can move to a shared bucket by defining the bucket name in the URL. Move to some\nbucket of your project and replace the bucket name in the end of the URL with the name of the shared bucket:\n```\nhttps://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/containers/container/my_fishbucket\n```\n\n## Use example\n\nIn this example, we store a simple dataset in Allas using s3cmd.\n\nFirst, create a new bucket. The command `s3cmd ls` reveals that the object storage is empty at first. Then, use the command `s3cmd mb` to create a new bucket called _fish-bucket_.\n\n<pre>\n$ <b>s3cmd ls</b>\nls\n\n$ <b>s3cmd mb s3://fish-bucket</b>\nmb s3://fish-bucket/\nBucket 's3://fish-bucket/' created\n\n$ <b>s3cmd ls</b>\nls\n2018-03-12 13:01  s3://fish-bucket\n</pre>\nIt is recommended to collect the data to be stored as larger units and compress it before uploading it to the system.\n\nIn this example, we store the Bowtie2 indices and the genome of the zebrafish (danio rerio) in the fish bucket. Running `ls -lh` shows that the index files are available in the current directory:\n\n<pre>$ <b>ls -lh</b>\ntotal 3.2G\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 440M Mar 12 13:41 Danio_rerio.1.bt2\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 327M Mar 12 13:41 Danio_rerio.2.bt2\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 217K Mar 12 13:20 Danio_rerio.3.bt2\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 327M Mar 12 13:20 Danio_rerio.4.bt2\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 1.3G Mar 12 13:13 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.dna.toplevel.fa\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 440M Mar 12 14:03 Danio_rerio.rev.1.bt2\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 327M Mar 12 14:03 Danio_rerio.rev.2.bt2\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 599K Mar 12 13:13 log\n</pre>\n\nThe data is collected and compressed as a single file using the `tar` command:\n```text\ntar zcf zebrafish.tgz Danio_rerio*\n```\n\nThe size of the resulting file is about 2 GB. The compressed file can be uploaded to the fish bucket using the command `s3cmd put`:\n<pre>\n$ <b>ls -lh zebrafish.tgz</b>\n-rw------- 1 kkayttaj csc 9.3G Mar 12 15:23 zebrafish.tgz\n\n$ <b>s3cmd put zebrafish.tgz s3://fish-bucket</b>\nput zebrafish.tgz s3://fish-bucket\nupload: 'zebrafish.tgz' -> 's3://fish-bucket/zebrafish.tgz'  [1 of 1]\n 2081306836 of 2081306836   100% in   39s    50.16 MB/s  done\n\n$ <b>s3cmd ls s3://fish-bucket</b>\nls s3://fish-bucket\n2019-10-01 12:11 9982519261   s3://fish-bucket/zebrafish.tgz\n</pre>\n\nUploading 2 GB of data takes time. Retrieve the uploaded file:\n```text\ns3cmd get s3://fish-bucket/zebrafish.tgz\n```\n\nBy default, this bucket can only be accessed by the project members. However, using the command `s3cmd setacl`, you can make the file publicly available.\n\nFirst make the fish bucket public:\n```text\ns3cmd setacl --acl-public s3://fish-bucket\n```\n\nThen make the zebrafish genome file public:\n```text\ns3cmd setacl --acl-public s3://fish-bucket/zebrafish.tgz\n```\n\nThe syntax of the URL of the file:\n```text\nhttps://a3s.fi/bucket_name/object_name\n```\n\nIn this case, the file would be accessible using the link\n_https://a3s.fi/fish-bucket/zebrafish.tgz_\n\n\n## Publishing objects temporarily with signed URLs\n\nWith command _s3cmd signurl_ an object\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
