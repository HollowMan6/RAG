The virtual Desktop is isolated from the internet and **importing of software is restricted**, as required by the data permit authority. Thus, users cannot directly import software/scripts or other files on to their virtual Desktop when working with secondary use data. \n\nIf you need a specific program that is not pre-installed, it is recommended to [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) **before applying for the data permit**. This way, we can figure out if it is possible to customise your virtual desktop. \n\n### Pre-installed software:\n\n* CentOS7 (Operating system)\n* Emacs (Text editor)\n* htLib (A library)\n* LibreOffice (An open-source alternative to Microsoft Office)\n* miniconda (Installer for conda, a bootstrap version of Anaconda)\n* minimap2 (A sequence alignment program)\n* pigz (A compression tool for files)\n* pyro.ai (A tool for deep probabilistic modeling)\n* Python\n* R + R studio\n* SAMtools (Programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data)\n* nextflow (A workflow orchestrator)\n* Go (Programming language)\n\n### Scientific software\n\n**Python 3.7.9** including following packages:\n\n * Beautiful Soup, Bokeh, CatBoost, crypt4gh, Distributed Keras, Elephas, ELI5, Gensim, HTTPX, Keras, LightGBM, Matplotlib, NLTK, NumPy, pandas, Plotly, pydot, pyfuse3, PyTorch, QRcode, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Scrapy, Seaborn, spaCy, Statsmodels, TensorFlow, Trio, XGBoost.\n\n**R / RStudio Server** with the following properties:\n\n * Installation matching the `r-env-singularity/4.0.5` module on Puhti (R 4.0.5 + RStudio Server 1.4.1106, Bioconductor 3.12)\n * 1000+ pre-installed R packages\n * Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL)\n * GIS software (PROJ, GDAL, SAGA)\n * CUDA drivers\n * TensorFlow (used with R TensorFlow back-end)\n * R + RStudio Server versions matched with Puhti r-env-singularity module (R 4.0.5 + RStudio Server 1.4.1106, MRAN, Bioconductor 3.12)\n\n### RStudio on SD Desktop\n\nTo access RStudio on SD Desktop, open the terminal from the *Applications* tab in your virtual Desktop and launch RStudio with:\n\n```text\nstart-rstudio-server\n```\n\nThis will return a URL and a service-specific password:\n\n```\nRStudio Server - Sensitive Data Desktop Edition\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopy/Paste this URL into Firefox:\n\nhttp://localhost:8787/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnter these at the RStudio Server sign-in screen\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUsername: accountname  Password: Example23241232\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo stop RStudio Server: Ctrl+C\n```\n\nNext:\n\n * **paste** the URL in Firefox\n * after a few seconds, you can **input the username and password** (given by the terminal) and access the server.\n\n!!! Note\n    When using RStudio, you need to save your data in **shared-directory** if your colleagues need to access the same files.\n\n\n[![Desktop-rstudio](images/desktop/desktop-rstudio.png)](images/desktop/desktop-rstudio.png)\n\n\n## Limitations to SD Desktop\n\nTo comply with the regulation, SD Desktop for secondary use is **completely isolated from the internet and other services**. You can, for example, open a Firefox web browser, but you are not able to access any site on the internet.\n\n**The import of data and software is restricted in SD Desktop**. You cannot import any data or software yourself for security reasons. If you are working with a dataset for which you have received a permit from a data controller, the only way to access the data for analysis is by utilizing a specific application called **Data Gateway**. \n\n**Data export from SD Desktop is also restricted**. Only *non-sensitive* results can be exported from the workspace, and those can only be exported by the CSC project manager. Instructions for exporting your results are provided in the next paragraph.\n\nEncrypted files will be **visible in read-only mode**. This solution allows you to process large amounts of data without storing any copy on your virtual Desktop. However, this means that the files cannot be edited in SD Desktop.\n\nLastly, we are not yet providing a virtual Desktop with Windows operating system, or with GPUs. However, we are working on it, and you can find more information on the future developments of the services on our webpage.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
