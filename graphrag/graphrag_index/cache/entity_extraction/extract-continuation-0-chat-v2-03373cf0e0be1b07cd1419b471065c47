Modules and instructions for the following software have been\nupdated:\n\n* [Amber](../../apps/amber.md)\n* [CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md)\n* [GROMACS](../../apps/gromacs.md)\n* [LAMMPS](../../apps/lammps.md)\n* [NAMD](../../apps/namd.md)\n\nAt the same time, some old module versions have been deprecated. In general, we\nrecommend using the most recent software versions as they tend to have better\nperformance and less bugs than older releases.\n\n## PyTorch 2.4.1 available on LUMI, 19.9.2024\n\nPyTorch 2.4.1 with ROCm 6.1 is now available on LUMI. The LUMI PyTorch\nmodule now includes [vLLM version 0.5.5](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) \nin addition to FlashAttention-2, bitsandbytes and many other frequently \nrequested packages already added included in earlier installations.  See our\n[PyTorch module documentation for more information](../../apps/pytorch.md#available).\n\n## GROMACS 2024.3, 12.9.2024\n\n[GROMACS](../../apps/gromacs.md) 2024.3 is now available on Puhti and Mahti. See\n[release notes](https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.3/release-notes/2024/2024.3.html)\nfor a list of all new features and improvements.\n\n## JAX 0.4.30 available on Puhti and Mahti, 5.9.2024\n\n[JAX](../../apps/jax.md) 0.4.30 has been installed on Puhti and Mahti\nand set as the default version.\n\nThe `transformers` package is no longer included since it officially \nonly supports JAX up to version 0.4.13.\n\nFrom this version on, there will be \"small\" and \"full\" flavours of JAX,\nwhere the \"full\" flavour includes JAX ML ecosystem packages as before\nwhile the \"small\" flavour includes only JAX with GPU support as well as\nCPU-only versions of Tensorflow and PyTorch for their data loading and\nprocessing utilities but no additional packages. You can use the latter\nif you want a cleaner base to install additional packages on.\n\nThe LUMI installation will be delayed until early autumn due to the\nongoing system update and changes to the relevant system driver versions.\n\n## CP2K 2024.2 available on Puhti and Mahti, 27.8.2024\n\n[CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md) 2024.2 has been installed and set as the default\nmodule on Puhti and Mahti. See\n[release notes](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/releases/tag/v2024.2)\nfor a list of new features, fixes and breaking changes.\n\n## ORCA 6.0.0, 22.8.2024\n\n[ORCA](../../apps/orca.md) 6.0.0 is now available on Puhti and Mahti. This major\nrelease brings numerous new features and enhancements. For full details, check out\nthe [ORCA 6 Changes](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.0/manual/contents/changes.html).\n\n## PyTorch 2.4.0, 21.8.2024\n\n[PyTorch](../../apps/pytorch.md) 2.4.0 added to Puhti and Mahti. The\nLUMI installation will be delayed until after the current service\nbreak. The torchtext package is no longer included as it has been\ndeprecated and no longer works with PyTorch 2.4. See our [PyTorch\nmodule documentation for more information](../../apps/pytorch.md#available).\n\n## AMS 2024 available on Puhti and Mahti, 20.8.2024\n\n[AMS](../../apps/ams.md) has been updated to version 2024.102 on both Mahti and Puhti\nand set as the default module. The [AMS2024 release notes](https://www.scm.com/downloads/release-notes-amsterdam-modeling-suite-2024/)\nsummarize major changes and improvements since AMS2023.\n\n## Geoconda 3.11.9, 7.8.2024\n\n[geoconda](../../apps/geoconda.md) version 3.11.9 has been added\nand set as the default module on Puhti and Mahti. Besides package updates, it includes a few new packages: `geo2ml`, `h3pandas`, `openeo`, `pcraster` and `r5py`. From packages available in previous geoconda, `copc-lib` and `osmnx` unfortunately could not be added this time.\n\n## Schrödinger Maestro 2024.3, 5.8.2024\n\n[Schrödinger Maestro](../../apps/maestro.md) version 2024.3 has been installed\nand set as the default module on Puhti and Mahti.
