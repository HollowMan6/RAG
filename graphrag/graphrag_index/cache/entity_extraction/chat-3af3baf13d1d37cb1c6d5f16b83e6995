Please be aware that this process can be lengthy (anywhere between one to four months), but we will support you at every step. Requests will be processed in the order they are received. \n\n!!! Note\n    Before you begin, it's crucial to ensure that a service agreement specific to the Federated EGA service is in place between CSC (as data processor) and your home organization (or data controller). Please make sure, before starting to submit any data, that all the legal agreements are in place. You can do so by contacting [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: sensitive data) or your home organization's legal services.\n\n## Submission process overview \n[![FEGA submission process overview](images/fega/fega_submission_overview.png)](images/fega/fega_submission_overview.png)\n\n## Step 1: General information of the submission\n\nSubmission to the Finnish Federated EGA service starts with contacting the Finnish FEGA helpdesk and providing the general information of the submission.\n\nTo begin the submission process, please fill in the [general information form](./fega-general-information.docx) with contact information, details about the data submission type and information about the data controller, or provide the same information in an email message. Send the required information via email to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Federated EGA). You will receive further instructions.\n\n!!! note\n\n    - This workflow is specific for submitting datasets to Finnish FEGA. Central EGA and other FEGA nodes have different data submission processes.\n    \n    - Data submission might take up to a month or more. Therefore, please get in touch with us well in advance (before submitting your manuscript to a scientific journal). In this way, we can offer proper support and guide you during the entire process.\n    \n    - Please use the same email thread throughout the whole submission process.\n    \n## Step 2: Legal agreements \n\nData deposition to the Finnish Federated EGA requires a series of legal agreements: a Service Agreement for Federated EGA and a data Access Agreement. The required legal documents state the roles of a data processor and a data controller, which are defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). CSC acts as a data processor, while in most research projects, the data controller is an academic organization or other legal entity. The ownership of the data does not change by using this service. Storing data in the service is not covered by the [free-of-charge](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases) use cases, more information in the [pricing document](./federated-ega-pricing.pdf).\n\n* **Service agreement for Federated EGA**: your organization (or data controller) must have a specific service agreement with CSC (data processor) before accessing the Finnish Federated EGA service. This service agreement includes the Data Processing Agreement (DPA), which outlines the specifics of data processing, such as its scope and purpose, as well as the rights and duties between the controller and the processor. Your organization's legal service will assist you in outlining these necessary agreements. If more support is needed, please contact us at [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Federated EGA) and provide the contact information for your organization's legal representative.\n\n* **Data Access Agreement**: The Data Access Agreement (DAA) is a contract between the Data Access Committee (DAC) and an applicant seeking access to the data for reuse. Through the DAA, you can define conditions and restrictions for data reuse, including policies governing data use, publication, download, and access. Each submitted dataset will be linked to this agreement (refer to Step 6: Data Access Committee and Policy Registration below). The DAA might also include a data transfer agreement, necessary when researchers from non-EU/non-EEA regions access the data via SD Desktop. For further information, please contact your home organization's legal services. You can find an example template [here](https://ega-archive.org/assets/files/Example_DAA.doc).\n\n\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"155\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXOph-0wacc?si=9NWFpr-LjF_d4f2W\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n!!! Note\n    Please be aware that your organization might already have the necessary agreements in place with CSC, or templates for Data Access Agreements available. We are here to provide support if additional information is required (subject: Federated EGA). \n\n\n## Step 3: Credentials\n\nOnce the legal agreements between the data controller and CSC are finalized, you can register on the [EGA webpage](https://ega-archive.org/register/) to create central EGA credentials. You will receive an activation link via email after your registration has been approved by central EGA. After activating your credentials, contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) in order to be added as a Finnish FEGA submitter.\n\n!!! note\n    Central EGA credentials, including a username (usually this is your email address) and a password, are required for the encryption and data upload to Finnish FEGA and for metadata submission with the submitter portal.\n\n## Step 4: Data formats\nBefore uploading the data to FEGA, you must prepare the datasets and verify the data formats. Some examples of the accepted formats are listed below.\n\n!!! note\n    A dataset is usually defined as a set of files belonging to the same experiment and data type. One study can be linked to multiple datasets.
