In the former case, data recovery might not be possible\n\tand your data could be permanently lost.\n\n\n### ACLs vs Policies \n\nThere are two ways to manage access for data in LUMI-O:\n\n1. Policies\n2. Access control list (ACL)\n\nWhile ACLs are simpler to configure, they are an older\nmethod for access control and offer much less granular control\nover permissions. **We recommend primarily using Policies**  \n\nSome other differences include:\n\n- ACLs can only be used to allow more access, not restrict access from the defaults\n- ACLs can be applied to buckets and objects while policies can only be applied to buckets\n\t- You can create bucket policies which only affect specific objects in the bucket. \n\t- This also means that you will have to individually / recursively apply ACL changes to all objects in a bucket + the bucket itself.\n\n\n### Configuring Policies\n\nYou can apply policies to a bucket using `s3cmd` or `aws` commands:\n\n```\ns3cmd setpolicy policy.json s3://<bucket_name>/\n```\n\nor\n\n```\naws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> --policy file://policy.json\n```\n\nYou can list the existing polices on a bucket with:\n\n```\ns3cmd info s3://<bucket_name>\n```\n\nor \n\n```\naws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name>\n```\n\n\nThe following example policy would allow the project `465000002` to:\n\n- Download the object `out.json` from our bucket called `fortheauthenticated`\n- List all objects in the `fortheauthenticated` bucket\n- Create/modify (by overwriting) to the `upload.json` object in the `fortheauthenticated` bucket\n\nThe critical part is the format of the Principal which is of the format\n\n```\n\"arn:aws:iam::<lumi project id>:user/<lumi project id>\"\n```\n\nThe full policy:\n\n_policy.json_\n```json\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:GetObject\"],\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::fortheauthenticated/out.json\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n                \"AWS\": [ \n                      \"arn:aws:iam::465000002:user/465000002\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:ListBucket\"],\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::fortheauthenticated\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n                \"AWS\": [ \n                      \"arn:aws:iam::465000002:user/465000002\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:PutObject\"],\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::fortheauthenticated/upload.json\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n                \"AWS\": [ \n                      \"arn:aws:iam::465000002:user/465000002\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAnother potentially useful policy is a restriction on incoming  IP:s\n\n```\n{  \n  \"Statement\": [  \n    {  \n      \"Sid\": \"IPAllow\",  \n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",  \n      \"Principal\": \"*\",  \n      \"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\",  \n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::almostpublic/data*\" ,\n      \"Condition\":   \n        {  \n          \"IpAddress\": {\"aws:SourceIp\": \"193.167.209.166\"}  \n        }  \n    }  \n  ]  \n}\n```\n\nThis would allow any one connecting from \"[lumi-uan04.csc.fi](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/loggingin/#lumi-login-nodes-advanced)\" to upload\nobjects starting with `data` to the bucket called `almostpublic` (but not download or list them).\n\n!!! warning\n\tIP restrictions should never be the only measure to protect your data.\n\tEspecially if there are multiple users on the system. Source IPs can also be spoofed. \n\n\nFor a full list of Actions and resources see the \n[AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html)\n\n**Don't use an action which you do not understand**\n\nTo remove policies you can do: \n\n```bash\ns3cmd delpolicy s3://<bucket>\n```\n\nor \n\n```bash\naws s3api delete-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name>\n```\n\n\n### Configuring Access control lists (ACLs): \n\nYou can apply ACL:s to buckets or individual objects\n\n!!! important \n\tACL:s are not inherited, e.g new objects created in a bucket with an ACL will\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
