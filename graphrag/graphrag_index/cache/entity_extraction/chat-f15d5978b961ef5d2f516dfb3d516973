There is also [separate documentation on MPI jobs](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#mpi-based-batch-jobs). You may also wish to check the relevant R package manuals and [this page](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/puhti/02_parallel_future) for examples of parallel computing using the `raster` package.\n\n!!! note\n    For jobs employing the Rmpi package, please use snow (which is built on top of Rmpi). Jobs using Rmpi alone are unavailable due to compatibility issues.\n\n*Multi-core jobs*\n\nTo submit a job employing multiple cores on a single node, one could use the following batch job file. The job reserves a single task (`--ntasks=1`), eight cores (`--cpus-per-task=8`) and a total of 8 GB of memory (`--mem-per-cpu=1000)`. The run time is limited to five minutes.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_multicore\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n\n# Load r-env\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save myscript.R\n```\n\n*Array jobs*\n\nArray jobs can be used to handle [*embarrassingly parallel*](../computing/running/array-jobs.md) tasks. The script below would submit a job involving ten subtasks on the `small` partition, with each requiring less than five minutes of computing time and less than 1 GB of memory.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_array\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --array=1-10\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n\n# Load r-env\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save myscript.R $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID\n```\n\nFor larger-scale array jobs involving [many small independent runs](../support/tutorials/many.md), we could consider the following example. Let's assume that we have a total of 1500 runs that we would like to complete. We also have a list (`mylist.txt`) with unique identifiers for each run that we wish to use as part of an R script to retrieve the correct data set for analysis. The list is arranged row-by-row like this:\n\n```bash\nset1\nset2\nset3\n(...)\nset1500\n```\n\nTo perform our analysis efficiently, we could take advantage of a module including [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) to \"schedule\" how the runs are completed within the array job. There are a couple of details we should notice about the batch job script below:\n\n- The way in which the runs are split into arrays is case-specific and requires manual calculation. In the current example, since `mylist.txt` contains 1500 identifiers and we are using 10 arrays, a decision has been made to allocate 150 runs per array. \n\n- We use `-j $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -k`  to tell GNU parallel to keep running 4 applications in parallel, while ensuring that the job output order matches the input order.  The number of simultaneous parallel applications is defined using `--cpus-per-task`.\n\n- For a real-life analysis, we would likely need much more time and memory (determined by what we do within our R script).\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_array_gnupara\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --array=0-9\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n\n# Load parallel and r-env\nmodule load parallel/20200122\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Split runs into arrays and run the R script\n(( from_run = SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID * 150 + 1 ))\n(( to_run = SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID * 150 + 150 ))\n\nsed -n \"${\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
