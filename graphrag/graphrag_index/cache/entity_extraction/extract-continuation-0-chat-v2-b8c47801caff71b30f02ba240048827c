This is a guide for exactly how to do that. The only thing you need to know is your project number! \n\n## Configuring the environment\n\nThe first step after you have logged into LUMI (via `ssh lumi` on your terminal) is to configure the environment. The base environment when first logging into LUMI does not provide the necessary tools to submit quantum jobs, therefore a quantum software stack has been created which sets up the correct python virtual environments and the correct environment variables. This is accessed through the LMOD system on LUMI using *modules*.\n\nTo use the quantum software stack you first need to tell LMOD where to search for modules. \n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/quantum/modulefiles\n```\n\nYou can then see the list of available *modules* with `module avail`. The quantum modules should be at the top! In this walkthrough Qiskit will be used, therefore the next step is to load the module into our current environment with\n\n```bash\nmodule load helmi_qiskit\n```\n\n\n## Creating your first quantum program\n\nThe next step is to create your quantum circuit! Here a simple bell state will be created between two qubits, demonstrating entanglement between them! For this we will be using Qiskit but the steps are very similar for Cirq. It is good practice to work in your projects scratch directory, which you can navigate to with `cd /scratch/project_xxx`, inserting your project number.\n\n!!! info \"Tip!\"\n\t\n\tYou can quickly see your LUMI workspaces with\n\t`module load lumi-workspaces` and\n\t`lumi-workspaces`\n\nLet us first create our python file with `nano first_quantum_job.py`. Here we use `nano` but if you are comfortable you can also use `vim` or `emacs`. This will bring up the `nano` text editor, the useful commands are at the bottom, to save and exit CTRL-X + Y.\n\n### Importing the libraries\n\nFirst let's import the right python libraries\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, execute\nfrom iqm.qiskit_iqm import IQMProvider\n```\n\n### Creating the circuit\n\nThe quantum circuit is created by defining a `QuantumRegister` which hold our qubits and classical bits respectively. As this circuit only requires 2 qubits we only create a `QuantumRegister` of size 2. The number of shots is also defined here. The number of shots is the number of times a quantum circuit is executed. We do this because quantum computers are probabilistic machines and by repeating the experiment many times we can get close to a deterministic result to be able to draw conclusions from. A good number of shots for your first quantum job is `shots = 1000`. Increasing the shots will increase the precision of your results. \n\n```python\n\nshots = 10000  # Number of repetitions of the Quantum Circuit\n\nqreg = QuantumRegister(2, \"qB\")\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(qreg, name='Bell pair circuit')\n```\n\nNow we actually add some gates to the circuit. Here a Hadamard gate is added to the first qubit or the first qubit in the quantum register. Then a controlled-x gate is added with two arguments as it is a two qubit gate. \n\n```python\ncircuit.h(qreg[0])  # Hadamard gate on the first qubit in the Quantum Register\ncircuit.cx(qreg[1], qreg[0])  # Controlled-X gate between the second qubit and first qubit\ncircuit.measure_all()  # Measure all qubits in the Quantum Register.\n```\n\nNote that [`measure_all()`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.html#qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.measure_all) creates it's own [`ClassicalRegister`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.ClassicalRegister.html)!\n\nNow the circuit is created! If you wish you can see what your circuit looks like by adding a print statement `print(circuit.draw())` and quickly running the python script. \n\n## Setting the backend\n\nFirst we need to set our provider and backend. The provider is the service which gives an interface to the quantum computer and the backend provides the tools necessary to submitting the quantum job. The `HELMI_CORTEX_URL` is the endpoint to reach Helmi and is only reachable inside the `q_fiqci` partition. This environment variable is set automatically when loading the `helmi_qiskit` module. \n\n```python\nHELMI_CORTEX_URL = os.getenv('HELMI_CORTEX_URL')\nif not HELMI_CORTEX_URL:\n    raise ValueError(\"Environment variable HELMI_CORTEX_URL is not set\")\n\nprovider = IQMProvider(HELMI_CORTEX_URL)\nbackend = provider.get_backend()\n```\n### Decomposing the circuit (*Optional*)\n\nThe next step is optional and where the quantum circuit into you've just created into it's *basis gates*. These basis gates are the actual quantum gates on the quantum computer. The process of decomposition involves turning the above Hadamard and controlled-x gates into something that can be physically run on the quantum computer. Helmi's basis gates are the two-qubit controlled-z and a the one-qubit rotational gate around the x-y plane. In Qiskit these are defined in the backend and can be printed with `backend.operation_names`. \n\n```python\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a platform that provides access to quantum computing resources, including tools and environments for running quantum computing jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Helmi is a real quantum computer accessible through LUMI for running quantum computing jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QISKIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Qiskit is a quantum computing software development framework used for creating quantum programs to run on quantum computers like Helmi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IQMProvider<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IQMProvider is a service interface in Qiskit for accessing the Helmi quantum computer backend)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>HELMI<|>LUMI provides access to the Helmi quantum computer for running quantum computing jobs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QISKIT<|>HELMI<|>Qiskit is used to create quantum computing programs that run on the Helmi quantum computer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IQMProvider<|>HELMI<|>IQMProvider acts as the interface for accessing Helmi's quantum computing backend through Qiskit<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
