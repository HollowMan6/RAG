It enables the running of operating systems and applications intended for one machine on an entirely different platform. This tool is integral to various virtualization frameworks. Notably, it's implemented within the OpenStack cloud infrastructure.\n\n## 1. Downloading a backup or snapshot\n\nDownloading a backup or snapshot image from cPouta to your local PC. To accomplish this, you need to have the OpenStack command-line client (`openstack`). Source your openrc script file to configure the necessary environment variables for authentication. If you don't have this file, you can download it from the web [UI](https://pouta.csc.fi/). For more information see [Installing the client tools using pip](install-client.md) and [Configure your terminal environment for OpenStack](install-client.md).\n\nFor example, on a Debian/Ubuntu-based system, you can install these with:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install python3-openstackclient \n```\nAnd  source openrc script file:\n\n```bash\nsource <project_name_here>-openrc.sh\n```\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your password. See [Install OpenStack client](install-client.md) for other Operating Systems.\n\nList the images/snapshots including the disk format that are available in your OpenStack project:\n\n```bash\nopenstack image list --long\n```\n\nNote down the ID of the image you want to download.\n\nNow, download the image to your local machine:\n\n```bash\nopenstack image save --file LOCAL_IMAGE_FILENAME.qcow2 IMAGE_ID\n```\n\nReplace `LOCAL_IMAGE_FILENAME.qcow2` with your desired local filename, disk format  and `IMAGE_ID` with the ID.\n\n## 2. Understanding file formats of the downloaded backup or snapshot\n\nWhen you download a backup or snapshot of your virtual machine (VM) from cPouta, the file format of the downloaded image could be raw or qcow2. The QEMU emulator supports several disk formats including raw, vdi, and qcow2. See [OpenStack Disk and Container Formats](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/stein/user/formats.html) for more information.\n\n- **QCOW2 (QEMU Copy On Write)**: This is the default and most common format for OpenStack images, especially when QEMU is used.\n- **RAW**: A raw disk image format. It's generally larger in size than QCOW2 images.\n- **VDI (Virtual Disk Image)**: This format is mainly associated with VirtualBox but can also be used with OpenStack.\n\nThe following command tell you the format of the image, providede that you have the `qemu-img` tool installed. See [QEMU installation](https://www.qemu.org/download/#linux) for more information.\n\n```bash\nqemu-img info /path/to/your/image\n```\n\n## 3. Converting VM image disk formats to QCOW2 with QEMU\n\nIf you do not have a QCOW2 image but have a VM disk in another format, you can convert it to QCOW2 using QEMU's `qemu-img` tool. The following command \nconverts  your VM disk to QCOW2 format:\n\n```bash\nqemu-img convert -f [source_format] -O qcow2 [source_image] [destination_image.qcow2]\n```    \n\nWhere:\n\n- `[source_format]`: The format of the source image (e.g., `raw`, `vdi`, `vmdk`, `vhdx`).\n- `[source_image]`: The path to the source VM disk.\n- `[destination_image.qcow2]`: The path where you want to save the converted QCOW2 image.\n\nFor example, to convert the `testCentOS.raw` downloaded image to QCOW2 image using QEMU, first get image info and then convert it as following:\n\n```bash\nqemu-img info testCentOS.raw \n\nimage: testCentOS.raw\nfile format: raw\nvirtual size: 2.97 GiB (3184721920 bytes)\ndisk size: 2.97 GiB\n```\n\n```bash\nqemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 testCentOS.raw testCentOS.qcow2\n```\n\nAfter the conversion process completes, you can check the details of the converted image using:\n\n```bash\nqemu-img info testCentOS.qcow2\n```\n\n## 4. Running downloaded backup or snapshot images locally with QEMU\n\nThe downloaded backup or snapshot image from cPouta, which is typically in the `raw` format. Before executing it with QEMU, it's essential to convert this image to the `qcow2` format. Please refer to the previous section for steps on format conversion and verification. Before running the virtual machine locally, ensure that `cloud-utils` and `qemu-kvm` packages are installed. A step-by-step guide as follows:\n\n!!! Warning  \n    The image you downloaded from cPouta needs cloud-init and requires modification to function properly locally. The image downloaded may require configuration change on the networking setup locally.\n\n- Install necessary packages.\n    \n    For RHEL or CentOS 8 system:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo dnf install cloud-utils\n    ```\n\n    On a Debian/Ubuntu-based system:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo apt-get install cloud-image-utils\n    ```\n\n- Prepare the cloud-init configuration.\n\n    Create a file named `cloud-config.yaml` with the following content:\n\n    ```yaml\n    #cloud-config\n    ssh_authorized_keys:\n    - YOUR_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY\n    ```\n\n    Replace `YOUR_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` with the content of your\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
