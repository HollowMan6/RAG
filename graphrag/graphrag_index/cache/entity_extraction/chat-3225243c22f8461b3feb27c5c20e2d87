If you want to keep using the older version though, it has \nto be installed in your own file space.\n\nThe containers we provide do in general not depend on any specific version of the Cray \nProgramming Environment and hence also not on a specific version of the LUMI software stack.\nHence, LUMI provides a mechanism to install the container modules in a place where they will \nbe found by all partitions of all LUMI stacks and by the CrayEnv stack. To this end, you can \ninstall in the dummy partition `partition/container`, e.g.,\n\n```\nmodule load LUMI partition/container EasyBuild-user\neb <container-easyconfig.eb>\n```\n\nNote that to subsequently use the container you do not need to load `partition/common` or \n`EasyBuild-user`.\n\nMany containers come with documentation about their use. We encourage you to check\nthe documentation in the [LUMI Software Library][software-library] for the containers,\nand to check the help provided by the module after installation (with `module help`\nor `module spider`).\n\n\n### Some common problems\n\n1.  **`module avail` does not show the module.**\n\n    There are two possible causes for this.\n\n    1.  Lmod builds a cache of all modules on the system. EasyBuild will clear the cache \n        so that it will be rebuilt after installing a software package and hence the \n        newly installed modules should be found. In rare cases, Lmod may be in a corrupt\n        state. In those cases the best solution is to clear the cache (unless it happens\n        right after running the `eb` command to install a module): \n\n        ```bash\n        rm -rf ~/.lmod.d/.cache\n        ```\n\n        and to log out and log in again to start with a clean shell.\n\n    2.  If the problem occurs later on, e.g., while running a job, then a common cause is that\n        you have a different version of the `LUMI` and/or `partition` modules loaded than used when\n        installing the software package.\n\n        Note that even the LUMI CPU compute nodes have a newer processor than the login nodes and\n        may benefit from processor-specific optimizations which is why they use a different `partition`\n        module. If you load one of the versions of the `LUMI` module on the login nodes, it will \n        automatically load `partition/L` while if you do the load on a regular LUMI-C compute node,\n        it will load `partition/C`.\n\n        In the example above, if the installation commands\n        were executed on the login node, the software would have been installed in `partition/L`,\n        but if we then do a `module load LUMI/23.09` on the compute nodes, `partition/C` would have been\n        selected. To get a GROMACS version in `partition/C` that EasyBuild would build with compiler settings\n        that are specific for the processors in the compute nodes, either do the compilation on a compute node\n        or use *cross-compiling* by loading `partition/C` after loading `LUMI/23.09` in step 1 above.\n\n2.  **EasyBuild complains that some modules are already loaded.**\n\n    EasyBuild prefers to work in a clean environment with no modules loaded that are installed via EasyBuild\n    except for a very select list. It will complain if other modules are loaded (though only fail if a module\n    for one of the packages that you try to install is already loaded).\n    It is best to take this warning seriously and to install in a relatively clean shell,\n    as otherwise the installation process may pick up software libraries that it should not have used.\n\n\n## Advanced guide to EasyBuild on LUMI\n\n### Toolchains on Cray\n\nToolchains in EasyBuild contain at least a compiler, but can also contain an\nMPI library and a number of mathematical libraries (BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK and\nan FFT library). Programs compiled with different toolchains cannot be loaded\ntogether (though the module system will not always prevent this on LUMI).\n\nThe toolchains on LUMI are different from what you may be used to from non-Cray\nsystems. On most systems, EasyBuild uses its own toolchains installed from\nwithin EasyBuild, but on LUMI we use toolchains that are based on the Cray\nProgramming Environment. Four toolchains are currently implemented\n\n- `cpeGNU` is the equivalent of the Cray `PrgEnv-gnu` programming environment\n- `cpeCray` is the equivalent of the Cray `PrgEnv-cray` programming environment\n- `cpeAOCC` is the equivalent of the Cray `PrgEnv-aocc` programming environment\n- `cpeAMD` is the equivalent of the Cray `PrgEnv-amd` programming environment\n\nAll four toolchains use `cray-mpich` over the Open Fabric Interface library\n(`craype-network-ofi`) and Cray LibSci for the mathematical libraries, with the\nreleases taken from the Cray PE release that corresponds to the version number\nof the `cpeGNU`, `cpeCray`, `cpeAOCC`, or `cpeAMD` module.\n\n??? note \"cpeGNU/Cray/AOCC/AMD and PrgEnv-gnu/cray/aocc/amd\"\n    Currently the `cpeGNU`, `cpeCray`, `cpeAOCC`, and `cpeAMD` modules don't\n    load the corresponding `Prg\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
