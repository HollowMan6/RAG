Python itself is licensed under the\n[PSF License](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html), which is also open source.\n\n## Usage\n\nOur\n[Python usage guide](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md)\ncontains instructions for installing packages,\nusing different development environments and doing parallel processing\nwith Python.\n\nIt is generally recommended to use one of\n[pre-installed Python environments](python.md#pre-installed-python-environments)\nfor computing,\nsince these already contain the essential libraries for most uses.\nIf for some reason one wishes to use Python without loading an environment\nmodule, a\nbasic\n[system Python](python.md#system-python)\nis also available.\n\n### System Python\n\nIf using a pre-installed environment is not suitable,\nthe basic system Python 3.9 can be launched with:\n\n```bash\npython3.9\n```\n\n!!! warning\n    It is strongly advised to explicitly launch Python version 3.9 as\n    above, since **the default version launched by `python3` (3.6.8) has\n    [reached end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)**.\n\n### Pre-installed Python environments\n\nPuhti and Mahti have several pre-installed\n[environment modules](../computing/modules.md) containing\nPython environments made for different science areas.\nFor more details about the Python versions and libraries that are available\nfor a module, please see the corresponding application page by opening\none of the links in the table below.\n\n| Module name | Purpose | Package list |\n|-|-|-|\n| [biopythontools](biopython.md) | bioinformatics | [open](https://a3s.fi/python-pkg-lists/biopythontools.txt) |\n| [geoconda](geoconda.md) | geoinformatics | [open](https://a3s.fi/python-pkg-lists/geoconda.txt) |\n| [jax](jax.md) | JAX ML framework | [open](https://a3s.fi/python-pkg-lists/jax.txt) |\n| [python-data](python-data.md) | data analysis and ML utilities | [open](https://a3s.fi/python-pkg-lists/python-data.txt) |\n| [pytorch](pytorch.md) | PyTorch ML framework | [open](https://a3s.fi/python-pkg-lists/pytorch.txt) |\n| [qiskit](qiskit.md) | quantum computing | [open](https://a3s.fi/python-pkg-lists/qiskit.txt) |\n| [tensorflow](tensorflow.md) | TensorFlow ML framework | [open](https://a3s.fi/python-pkg-lists/tensorflow.txt) |\n\nTo use any of the above environments, simply load the corresponding module\nusing the `module load` command.\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nmodule load python-data\n```\n\nTypically, after activating a Python-based module, the `python3` command points\nto a version of Python that is newer than the default system Python and has a\nwider set of available packages. You can always check the Python version\nwith the command `python3 --version`, and the full path of the command with\n`which python3` (to see if you are using the system Python or one from the\nmodules listed above).\n\n### Custom Python environments\n\nWhile the pre-installed Python environments suffice for many applications,\nprojects often involve tasks which require additional libraries.\nThe following options are available in this case:\n\n* [Installing Python packages to existing modules](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules)\n* [Creating your own Python environments](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md#creating-your-own-python-environments)\n\n## References\n\n* [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/)\n\n## More information\n\n* [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)\n* [The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language widely used for scientific computing, licensed under the PSF License which is open source\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC supercomputers offer Python for scientific computing with a guide for effective usage\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSF LICENSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The open source license under which Python is distributed\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing environment where Python 3.x versions are available\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing environment where Python 3.x versions are available\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The basic system Python 3.9 available for use without loading an environment module\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOPYTHONTOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python environment module for bioinformatics\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEOCONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python environment module for geoinformatics\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python environment module for the JAX ML framework\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON-DATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python environment module for data analysis and ML utilities\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python environment module for the PyTorch ML framework\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QISKIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python environment module for quantum computing\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENSORFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python environment module for the TensorFlow ML framework\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>Python is used on CSC supercomputers for scientific computing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>PSF LICENSE<|>Python is licensed under the PSF License<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>PYTHON<|>Python 3.x versions are available on Puhti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>PYTHON<|>Python 3.x versions are available on Mahti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM PYTHON<|>PYTHON<|>System Python 3.9 is a version of Python available for use<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOPYTHONTOOLS<|>PYTHON<|>Biopythontools is a Python environment for bioinformatics<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEOCONDA<|>PYTHON<|>Geoconda is a Python environment for geoinformatics<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAX<|>PYTHON<|>JAX is a Python environment for the JAX ML framework<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON-DATA<|>PYTHON<|>Python-data is a Python environment for data analysis and ML utilities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>PYTHON<|>Pytorch is a Python environment for the PyTorch ML framework<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QISKIT<|>PYTHON<|>Qiskit is a Python environment for quantum computing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TENSORFLOW<|>PYTHON<|>TensorFlow is a Python environment for the TensorFlow ML framework<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
