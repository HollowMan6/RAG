It is possible to use several nodes on a supercomputer, but not to use different partitions for different workflow rules, for example CPU and GPU. HyperQueue executor fits well to workflows, which have a lot of short job steps, because it \"hides\" them from SLURM. Job step resources can be defined in the Snakefile as in SLURM job.\n\n```bash title=\"snakemake-hyperqueue.sh\"\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=snakemake_hq\n#SBATCH --account=project_2008498\n#SBATCH --time=00:20:00\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=40GB\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --output=slurm-%j.out\n#SBATCH --error=slurm-%j.err\n\nmodule load hyperqueue\nexport HQ_SERVER_DIR=\"$PWD/hq-server/$SLURM_JOB_ID\"\nmkdir -p \"$HQ_SERVER_DIR\"\nhq server start & until hq job list &> /dev/null ; do sleep 1 ; done\n\nsrun --overlap --cpu-bind=none --mpi=none hq worker start \\\n    --manager slurm \\\n    --on-server-lost finish-running \\\n    --cpus=\"$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\" & hq worker wait 1\n\n# snakemake version 8.x.x.x\nsnakemake --keep-going -s Snakefile --jobs 4 --executor cluster-generic --cluster-generic-submit-cmd \"hq submit --cpus 1\"\n\n# snakemake version 7.xx.x\n# snakemake --cluster \"hq submit  ...\"  \n```\nFinally, you can submit the batch job from the login node:\n\n```bash\nsbatch snakemake-hyperqueue.sh\n```\n\nSee [CSC HyperQueue page](../../apps/hyperqueue.md#using-hyperqueue-in-a-slurm-batch-job) for more options and details about HyperQueue.\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    HyperQueue creates task-specific folders (`job-<n>`) in the same directory\n    from where you submitted the batch script. These are sometimes useful for\n    debugging. However, if your code is working fine, the creation of many folders\n    may be annoying besides causing some load on the Lustre parallel file system.\n    You can prevent the creation of such task-specific folders by setting `stdout`\n    and `stderr` HyperQueue flags to `none` ( i.e., `hq submit --stdout=none --stderr=none ...`)\n\nIf you have any questions or problems regarding Snakemake, contact CSC servicedesk.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used for submitting, scheduling, and managing jobs on supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snakemake is a workflow management system that allows the creation of complex bioinformatics workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is an organization that provides IT support and resources, possibly related to supercomputing or bioinformatics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HyperQueue is a job execution engine designed to work efficiently with workflows having many short job steps, integrating with SLURM)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>SLURM<|>Snakemake can submit jobs to SLURM, indicating integration or compatibility between the two systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>Snakemake can run with HyperQueue as an executor, showing direct integration between Snakemake and HyperQueue<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>SLURM<|>HyperQueue can be used in conjunction with SLURM to manage job steps more efficiently, indicating a relationship in workflow management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>CSC provides support for Snakemake, suggesting a service or support relationship<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
