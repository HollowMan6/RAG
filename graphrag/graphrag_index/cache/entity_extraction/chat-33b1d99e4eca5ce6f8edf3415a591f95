In most cases the newer Zstandard method is\nsignificantly faster than the older, but very widely used methods like\ngzip or zip. The table below shows results for one sample case,\nwhere a 10 GB text file (fastq-formatted sequence data) was compressed with\nthese five methods in the Puhti supercomputer using default command settings.\n\n| Command | Size of the<br>compressed file<br>(original size 10GB) | Compression time | Decompression time |\n|------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| `zstd`     | 2.6 GB | 2 min   | 1.7 min |\n| `zstd -T4` | 2.6 GB | 0.8 min | 1.7 min |\n| `7z`       | 1.8 GB | 56 min  | 2.7 min |\n| `gzip`     | 2.5 GB | 29 min  | 2.5 min |\n| `bzip2`    | 2.0 GB | 17 min  | 9 min   |\n| `zip`      | 2.5 GB | 29 min  | 2.5 min |\n\n### gzip and gunzip\n\n**gzip** is probably the most commonly used packing tool in Unix and\nLinux systems. It uses the *Lempel-Ziv coding* (LZ77) for compressing\nthe data. gzip was already briefly mentioned in the tar chapter\nabove, but gzip can also be used as a totally separate tool. The normal\nusage of gzip is straightforward. To compress a file you give the\ncommand:\n\n```bash\ngzip file_name\n```\n\nRunning this command creates a compressed file and names it using the\noriginal file name with an extension `.gz`. When the compression is\nready, the original file is removed. If you want to preserve the original\nfile, you need to use redirection:\n\n```bash\ngzip < file_name > file_name.gz\n```\n\nDecompressing a gzipped file is done with command `gunzip`. In\naddition to gzip-compressed files, `gunzip` can also decompress files\ncompressed with the `zip` command. The basic syntax of `gunzip` is analogous\nto the compressing command:\n\n```bash\ngunzip file_name.gz\n```\n\nThe command above removes the compressed file when decompression is\nready. If you wish the keep the compressed file, you'll need redirection\nagain:\n\n```bash\ngunzip < file_name.gz > file_name\n```\n\ngzip has several command line options that are not discussed here. Use\n`man gzip` command to see the full list of available options. Also,\nnote that `gunzip` command is actually just a wrapper for the `gzip -d`\ncommand (option `-d` instructs `gzip` to decompress, rather than\ncompress) so you will not find a separate manual page for that.\n\n#### gzip example\n\nLet's assume we are in some directory on Puhti where we\nhave just one file called `my_data.dat`. Let's first check the size of\nthat file with command `ls -lh`:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -lh\ntotal 1.5G\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.5G Nov  4 13:07 my_data.dat\n```\n\nThe listing tells us that the size of the file is approximately 1.5 GB.\nNext, we compress the file with `gzip` and then check the file size again.\n\n```bash\n$ gzip my_data.dat\n$ ls -lh\ntotal 834M\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 833M Nov  4 13:07 my_data.dat.gz \n```\n\nThe original file has now been removed and replaced by the\ncompressed file. However, as a result we now have a compressed file that\nrequires only 833 MB of disk space (55% of the original size). Next, we\ndecompress the file:\n\n```bash\n$ gunzip my_data.dat.gz\n$ ls -lh\ntotal 1.5G\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.5G Nov  4 13:07 my_data.dat \n```\n\nThe file listing now shows that the compressed file has disappeared, and\nthe original file is available again.\n\n### bzip2 and bunzip2\n\n**bzip2** is a compression program that is used very similarly compared\nto gzip. The main difference between the two programs is that\nbzip2 uses *Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression\nalgorithm* combined with *Huffman coding* instead of the LZ77 algorithm\nused in gzip. The compression algorithm of bzip2 produces more effective\ncompression than gzip. However, computing the bzip2 compression\nusually is more complex and takes longer (i.e., uses more CPU cycles)\nthan gzip compression. The usage of bzip2 is very similar to that of\ngzip, but not all the command line options are identical. The basic\ncompression syntax is:\n\n```bash\nbzip2 file_name\nbzip2 < file_name > file_name.bz2\n```\n\nSimilarly, the decompression can be done with commands:\n\n```bash\nbunzip2 file_name.bz2\nbunzip2 < file_name.bz2 > file_name\n```\n\nNote that a file compressed with bzip2 can not be uncompressed with\ngunzip and vice versa.\n\nIn addition to the standard bzip2 and bunzip2 programs, you can\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
