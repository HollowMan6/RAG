TmoleX includes a structure builder\nand tools for preparing [TURBOMOLE](turbomole.md) jobs and analyzing results.\nTmoleX can also be used to submit and supervise [TURBOMOLE](turbomole.md) jobs\non CSC's supercomputers.\n  \nThe free TmoleX Client version can be used from your local Windows, Linux, or\nMacOS desktop to run [TURBOMOLE](turbomole.md) at CSC.\n\n## Available\n\n- Can be freely downloaded (requires registration) from the\n  [Dassault Systèmes website](https://discover.3ds.com/free-download-biovia-turbomole-demo-version).\n  This is a demo version that also includes a restricted version of TURBOMOLE.\n\n## License\n\nTmoleX can be downloaded freely, but the use of [TURBOMOLE](turbomole.md)\nitself is restricted to non-profit research purposes by users affiliated with\nacademic (i.e. degree-granting) institutes.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Use via your browser\n\nGo to [puhti.csc.fi](https://puhti.csc.fi/) using a web browser and login using\nyour CSC/Haka user account.\n\n1. From there [launch a Desktop](../../computing/webinterface/desktop/#launching). \n2. Open a `Terminal` and load the TURBOMOLE module `module load turbomole/7.8`.\n3. Start TmoleX with the command `TmoleX24`.\n4. Select `New Project` and define a suitable project in the `File Name` slot\n   (e.g. `/scratch/<yourproject>/my_tmolex_project`).\n5. Define your system and type of calculation. \n6. Small jobs can be run interactively: Start Job -> Run (local)\n7. Larger jobs should be run as batch jobs: Start Job -> Run (network). Example\n   settings are given below. Note that passwordless connection doesn't work via\n   the browser. Remember to save the settings using `Save Machine`.\n \n### Install your own TmoleX\n\nInstall the TmoleX client on your local workstation. For details, see the\nregistration and download page at\n[Dassault Systèmes website](https://discover.3ds.com/free-download-biovia-turbomole-demo-version).\nWith your version of TmoleX you can build your actual job locally and then\nsubmit the job to Puhti. With the client you can monitor how the job proceeds.\nWhen the job has completed you can retrieve the output and use your local\nclient to analyze the results.\n\nBelow are some example queue settings that can be used in TmoleX:\n\n![Slurm settings](../img/tmolex_remote_settings.png)\n\nWhere the complete script to be inserted in the field \"Script before job\nexecution\" contains something like (modify according to your actual needs):\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4             # MPI tasks per node\n#SBATCH --account=project_XXXXXX        # insert here the project to be billed \n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00                 # time as `hh:mm:ss`\nsource /appl/profile/zz-csc-env.sh\nulimit -s unlimited\nexport PARA_ARCH=MPI                    # use MPI\nmodule load turbomole/7.8\nexport SLURM_CPU_BIND=none\nexport PARNODES=$SLURM_NTASKS           # for MPI\nexport PATH=$TURBODIR/bin/`$TURBODIR/scripts/sysname`:$PATH\n```\n\nRemember to save the settings using `Save Machine`. \n\n## More information\n\n- [TURBOMOLE Documentation & How To](https://www.turbomole.org/turbomole/turbomole-documentation)\n- [TmoleX tutorial](https://www.turbomole.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tutorial-tmolex-4-4.pdf)\n- [TmoleX tuorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKH_m1IGb20)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TMOLEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TmoleX is a graphical user interface for handling TURBOMOLE calculations, including structure building, job preparation, and result analysis.
