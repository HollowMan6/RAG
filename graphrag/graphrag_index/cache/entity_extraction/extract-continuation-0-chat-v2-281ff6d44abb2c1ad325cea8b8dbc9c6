For example, commands for compiling MPI code like `mpicc`, `mpic++` and `mpif90` are unavailable as such. Instead, you should use the wrappers `cc`, `CC` and `ftn`, respectively. See the LUMI documentation for [more details on the available MPI wrappers](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/compiling/prgenv/#compile-an-mpi-program).\n\n## Disk areas and storage\n\nSimilar to CSC supercomputers, LUMI uses a [Lustre parallel filesystem](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/parallel-filesystems/lumip/). However, there's no fast local disk on LUMI similar to the local scratch on Puhti and Mahti-AI. Instead, a fast flash-based Lustre scratch space ([LUMI-F](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/parallel-filesystems/lumif/)) is available. There is also an object storage similar to Allas, [LUMI-O](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/), available. [See the LUMI documentation for more details](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/).\n\n## Available partitions\n\nLUMI has two types of partitions (queues): three that are allocatable by node (only full nodes can be requested, similar to Mahti) and five that are allocatable by resources (partial nodes can be requested, similar to Puhti). [See more details in the LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/partitions/), e.g. maximum wall-time/node count and naming of the partitions.\n\nNote that LUMI consortium country projects (e.g. Finnish LUMI projects) use different partitions than EuroHPC JU projects. The latter are prefixed by `ju-` and cannot be used unless you're a member of a project that has been allocated resources by the JU.\n\n## Billing\n\nBilling on LUMI differs from Mahti. The consumption of billing units (BUs) depends for example on which partition you are running on, as well as on whether you are using CPU, GPU (LUMI-G/LUMI-D) or storage resources, thus amounting to three different billing currencies. [See the LUMI documentation for more details and precise formulas](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/lumi_env/billing/).\n\n## Sensitive data\n\nLUMI projects are not allowed to handle sensitive (personal) data at the moment!\n\n## Support channels\n\nThe main channel for LUMI support is to [contact the LUMI User Support Team (LUST)](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MPI refers to the Message Passing Interface, a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer that uses specific compilers and storage systems, including a Lustre parallel filesystem and flash-based Lustre scratch space)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE PARALLEL FILESYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A high-performance parallel filesystem used by LUMI for data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-F<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A fast flash-based Lustre scratch space available on LUMI for temporary data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-O<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An object storage system similar to Allas, available on LUMI for data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC supercomputer that allows for partial node requests and has a local scratch for fast data processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC supercomputer that only allows full node requests and is mentioned in comparison to LUMI's storage capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI USER SUPPORT TEAM (LUST)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The main support channel for users of the LUMI supercomputer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROHPC JU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that allocates resources for projects on LUMI, requiring membership for access to certain partitions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUSTRE PARALLEL FILESYSTEM<|>LUMI uses the Lustre parallel filesystem for data storage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-F<|>LUMI provides a fast flash-based Lustre scratch space named LUMI-F for temporary data storage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-O<|>LUMI offers an object storage system named LUMI-O for data storage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUMI USER SUPPORT TEAM (LUST)<|>The LUMI User Support Team (LUST) is the main support channel for LUMI users<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>EUROHPC JU<|>LUMI consortium country projects and EuroHPC JU projects use different partitions on LUMI<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
