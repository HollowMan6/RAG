The steps are simple:\n\n1. Create and attach the volume. See the manual [Create and attach a volume](#create-and-attach-a-volume) from above.\n\n1. Create a standard Ansible inventory like this one:\n\n    ```ini\n    [all]\n    <VM_name> ansible_host=192.168.1.XXX ansible_user=<user>\n    # ...\n    [all:vars]\n    ansible_ssh_common_args='-J <jumphost>'\n    ```\n\n    In the example above you need to replace `<VM_name>` by the name of the VM, the IP `192.168.1.XXX` must be the correct IP of the VM, and finally the `<user>` has to also be replaced by the corresponding one. You need to have a line per VM node that you want to include in the cluster. Finally, if you are using a Jump Host, you need to replace `<jumphost>` by its connection information, like `ubuntu@177.51.170.99` \n\n1. Create a playbook like this one:\n\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n\n    - name: Configure VMs\n      hosts: all\n      gather_facts: true\n      become: true\n      roles:\n        - role: hosts\n        - role: gfs2\n    ```\n\n    This will run two roles, the `hosts` one if to create a `/etc/hosts` file in every VM with the IPs and names of every VM. The `gfs2` role installs and configures the cluster.\n\n1. And run it:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> ansible-playbook main-gfs2.yml -i inventory.ini\n    ```\n\n### GFS2 manual install\n\nIn order to install GFS2, you need to follow few steps:\n\n1. Install the VM nodes. There is no special consideration on this step, other than making sure the nodes can see each other in the Network (it is the default behaviour of VM nodes created in the same Pouta project), and that they are installed with the same distribution version. We have tested this with `AlmaLinux-9`, other distributions and versions might also work, but we have not tested them.\n\n1. Create and attach the volume. See the manual [Create and attach a volume](#create-and-attach-a-volume) from above.\n\n1. For AlmaLinux and other RedHat based distributions you just need enable two collections and install few packages **on every node:**\n\n    ```sh\n    $> dnf config-manager --enable  highavailability resilientstorage\n    $> dnf install pacemaker corosync pcs dlm gfs2-utils lvm2-lockd\n    ```\n\n#### Cluster setup\n!!! warning \"root user\"\n    The following commands are executed as the root user  \n    It will be specified throughout this tutorial if the commands must be run on a single or every node.\n\n1. Run the following commands **on every node:**\n\n    ```sh\n    $> systemctl start pcsd.service\n    $> systemctl enable pcsd.service\n    ```\n\n1. When you install `pacemaker`, it creates a user named `hacluster`. You need to set a password to this user:\n   \n    ```sh\n    $> passwd hacluster\n    ```\n\n1. Make sure that every node **domain name** can be resolved in every other node. In Pouta, the simplest way is to use [/etc/hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), where each host has a line similar to:\n\n    ```sh\n    <ip> <vm_name>\n    ```\n\n1. Run the following commands **only on one node**:\n\n    ```\n    $> pcs host auth node1 node2 node3 ...\n    Username: hacluster\n    Password: *******\n    $> pcs cluster setup <cluster_name> node1 node2 node3 ...\n    $> pcs cluster start --all\n    ```\n\n1. You can check the status by running the commands:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs cluster status\n    $> pcs status corosync\n    ```\n\nBy default, `corosync` and `pacemaker` services are disabled:\n\n    $> pcs status\n    Daemon Status:\n      corosync: active/disabled\n      pacemaker: active/disabled\n      pcsd: active/enabled\n    \nAccording to [pacemaker docs](https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/2.1/Clusters_from_Scratch/html/verification.html):\n\n    requiring a manual start of cluster services gives you the opportunity \n    to do a post-mortem investigation of a node failure \n    before returning it to the cluster.\n\nThat means, if a node crash and restart, you have to run the command `pcs cluster start [<NODENAME> | --all]` to start the cluster on it\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANSIBLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINDER-GFS2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cinder-GFS2 refers to a volume or storage configuration in OpenStack using the GFS2 (Global File System 2), which is a cluster file system for shared disk storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMALINUX-9<|>GEO<|>AlmaLinux-9 is a Linux distribution, a fork of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, mentioned as tested for compatibility with the GFS2 file system setup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PACEMAKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pacemaker is an open-source high availability resource manager software used in computer clusters to ensure cluster resources are kept running)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COROSYNC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corosync is an open-source project that implements high availability (HA) on Linux by providing a framework for creating HA applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PCS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PCS (Pacemaker Configuration System) is a command-line interface tool for managing cluster and node membership)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GFS2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GFS2 (Global File System 2) is a cluster file system for Linux used in data centers for shared disk storage and high availability)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDER-GFS2<|>OPENSTACK<|>Cinder-GFS2 is a volume configuration used within OpenStack environments for shared disk storage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANSIBLE<|>GFS2<|>Ansible is used to automate the deployment and configuration of GFS2 file systems in clusters<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PACEMAKER<|>COROSYNC<|>Pacemaker often works alongside Corosync to manage cluster resources and ensure high availability<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PCS<|>PACEMAKER<|>PCS is a tool used for managing Pacemaker-based clusters, indicating a direct relationship in cluster management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GFS2<|>ALMALINUX-9<|>GFS2 file system setup is tested and compatible with AlmaLinux-9, indicating a software compatibility relationship<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
