However, this option is available only via drag-and-drop. |\n| Shared bucket                                                 | I cannot upload data into a shared bucket.                                                                                                                                    | Your colleague didn’t add editing rights when they shared the bucket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                                               | I cannot see the content of a shared bucket.                                                                                                                                  | Your colleague didn’t add reading rights when they shared the bucket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
