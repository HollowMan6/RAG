To ensure consistent snapshots,\nsnapshots should only be created from instances which are powered off.\nFirst power off your instance:\n\n```bash\nopenstack server stop <name of vm>\n```\n\nThen create a snapshot of the machine's current state:\n\n```bash\nopenstack server image create --name <name of snapshot to create> <name of vm>\n```\n\nIt takes some time to create the snapshot. Once it is finished,\nit appears as a new image. If you need the original instance, you\ncan power it on after the snapshot has been created.\n\n```bash\nopenstack server start <name of vm>\n```\n\nIn the web UI under **Compute | Instances**, the instance-specific\nCreate Snapshot menu items work for the same effect as the CLI\ncommand above. The snapshots created will appear in the **Compute |\nImages** section.\n\n![Snapshot menu](/img/horizon-snapshot-menu.png)\n\n### Creating an image from scratch\n\nThere are a number of tools for creating images from scratch. These\ntools can be categorized into tools that involve running an operating\nsystem in a virtual machine for setting up the image and tools\nthat take a base image and make modifications to it without running a\nvirtual machine. We will call these \"installation-based tools\" and\n\"base image tools\".\n\n<table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 33%\" /> <col style=\"width: 33%\"\n/> <col style=\"width: 33%\" /> </colgroup> <thead> <tr class=\"header\">\n<th> </th> <th>Installation-based tools</th> <th>Base image tools</th>\n</tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td>Pros</td> <td><ul>\n<li>Easy to use and understand</li> <li>Familiar workflow for anyone\nfamiliar with manual OS installation</li> </ul></td> <td><ul>\n<li>Fast</li> <li>Possible to automate</li> <li>Produces small\nimages</li> <li>Produces images suitable for clouds without\nmodification</li> </ul></td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td>Cons</td>\n<td><ul> <li>Slow</li> <li>Upgrades are cumbersome</li> <li>Care must\nbe taken to make images cloud-ready after the initial installation</li>\n<li>Images produced can be quite large</li> </ul></td> <td><ul>\n<li>May be difficult to customize images</li> </ul></td> </tr> <tr\nclass=\"odd\"> <td>Examples</td> <td><a\nhref=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/virt-install\">virt-install</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://virt-manager.org/\">virt-manager</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/\">VirtualBox</a></td> <td><a\n href=\"https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder\">diskimage-builder</a>,\n<a href=\"http://libguestfs.org/virt-builder.1.html\">virt-builder</a></td>\n</tr> </tbody> </table>\n\nThe generic workflow when using installation-based tools:\n\n1. Obtain an installation media or a network installation link.\n2. Start a virtual machine and point it to the installation media or\n   network installation link.\n3. Go through the installer.\n      - This step can optionally be automated using e.g. [Kickstart].\n4. After the installation is finished, shut down the VM and use\n   additional tools to prepare the image for cloud use.\n\nThe generic workflow when using base image tools:\n\n1. Optionally customize configuration files that are used to generate\n   the final image.\n2. Determine the suitable customization parameters.\n3. Run a command to generate the final image.\n\nYou can get more information about creating images in the very\nthorough [OpenStack virtual machine image guide]. In particular, see\nthe chapters on [creating images manually] and [tool support for creating\nimages].\n\n#### Caveats to keep in mind when creating images from scratch\n\nThese caveats usually only need to be considered when using\ninstallation-based methods of image creation. The tools that use base\nimages are usually specifically designed to create images for clouds,\nso they take care of these caveats for you. If you decide to use an\ninstallation-based method of image creation, you should look into the\nexcellent [virt-sysprep] tool that takes care of most\nmodifications necessary for cloud use with a single command line\ncommand. This chapter lists some of the caveats that need to be\nhandled before an image is ready for clouds.\n\n#### cloud-init\n\nThere is a tool called [cloud-init] that must be installed on\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
