With the direct SFTP transfer, you can wait a moment after putting the first file to the folder for the directory to become visible in SD Apply, so the system doesn't create multiple entries for single directory. This might happen, if the files are sent too quickly one after the other. The files are not visible in the SFTP directory after transfer, as they are immediately ingested.\n\n!!! Note \n    You can always transfer more data for the same project/data permit by using the same directory. The data will become visible for the user in SD Desktop when they log in again. If you send multiple files with the same file name, the files are not replaced, but instead, both versions are kept and will be available for the user.\n    If you need to delete files after transfer, for example when the data permit expires, please contact CSC Service Desk. Access to the data can be restricted after the expiration or in any point of the project, if needed (see below), but deletion of the data from CSC needs to be done manually by our administrators.\n\n## Data access management\n\nAfter the data has been submitted, it is discoverable in SD Apply with the dataset ID (organization's identifier + the journal number).\n\nThe researcher who has received the data permit can contact the CSC service desk and ask for a CSC project with the data permit. After the project has been established, they can log in to SD Apply and apply for data access.\n\nThe assigned representatives of the data controller will receive a notification of the application via email. They can review and approve the application and set an end date for the data access in SD Apply. The access right can also be cancelled manually in the future, but automated end date is preferred to avoid unauthorised access after the data permit has expired.\n\n### Step 1: Confirm availability\n\nWhen a new dataset you are associated with is uploaded to CSC, you will receive an automated email via SD Apply asking you to confirm your availability to act as a data access controller. Follow the link in your email or log in directly to SD Apply at https://sd-apply.csc.fi/ and confirm your availability. \n\n### Step 2: Login\n\nAs a data access controller, you receive email notifications each time when an applicant applies for data access to the dataset you are associated with.\n\nTo start processing applications, follow the link in your email or log in directly to [SD Apply](https://sd-apply.csc.fi/). Login to SD Apply is possible either with user identity federation systems (Haka or Virtu login) or with CSC account.\n\n[![SD Apply login page](images/apply/apply_login.png)](images/apply/apply_login.png)\n\n!!! note\n    Always use the same identity provider when you log in to SD Apply because all your actions are connected to your login identity.\n\n### Step 3: Process the application\n\nIn SD Apply, navigate to the \"Actions\" tab to see all the applications that are waiting for approval. Select *View* to open the application you want to process. You do not have to follow any specific order when you process the applications. The approval process is fully dynamic.\n\n[![SD Apply \"Actions\" tab and application](images/apply/apply_dac.png)](images/apply/apply_dac.png)\n\n#### Approve or reject the application\n\nYou can approve or reject the application right away if the applicant has provided all the needed information. Select *Approve or reject application* under \"Actions\". If you reject an application, we recommend telling the applicant why the application was rejected by writing a comment.\n\nWhen approving the application, you can also set an end date for the access right, e.g. the expiration date of the data permit. If no end date is set, the access right needs to be cancelled manually when the data permit expires by closing the application (see [Step 4](./single-register-submission.md#step-4-after-processing-the-application)).\n\nThe applicant will receive an email notification about the decision. Once you approve or reject the application, the decision is final. You cannot edit it later. If the applicant has added members to their application, the members will get access rights too when the application is approved, if they have accepted the terms of use. Any member not having accepted the terms of use by that time will get access rights after they log in to SD Apply and accept the terms of use.\n\n!!! note\n    If the owner of the dataset has removed the dataset that applicant is applying for access, SD Apply will give a warning, but you can still process the application. However, if the dataset has been removed, you cannot approve or reject the application.\n\n#### Close the application\nYou can close the application at any stage of the process by selecting *Close application*. Closing means that the application process is cancelled and that the application cannot be modified or opened again. Write a comment on the comment field to explain why did you close the application.\n\nWe recommend closing the application, if it is somehow inappropriate. Deleting applications is not possible because we want to always provide a full history of the application process. You can find closed applications in the \"Actions\" tab under \"Processed applications\".\n\n### Step 4: After processing the application\n\nYou are able to manage the access rights of the applicant even after you have processed the application. You can find the processed applications from the \"Actions\" tab under \"Processed applications\". \"Processed applications\" view shows all the applications that have been approved, rejected, closed, or returned to the applicant. Select *View* to open a specific application.\n\n#### Close the application\nClosing the application cancels the access rights of the applicant and other application members.
