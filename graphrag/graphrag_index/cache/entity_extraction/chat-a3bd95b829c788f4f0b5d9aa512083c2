You can test that the LAStools module is loaded successfully with\n\n`lasinfo64 -h`\n\nFor all older versions, for example in the **geoconda** module, you will need to omit the 64 at the end of the tool name, for example:\n\n`lasinfo -h`\n\n### LAStools commands\n\nAll lastool installations in Puhti include the open source tools of LAStools.\n\n* las2las - extracts last returns, clips, subsamples, translates, etc ...\n* las2txt - turns LAS into human-readable and easy-to-parse ASCII\n* lasdiff - compares the data of two LAS/LAZ/ASCII files \n* lasindex - creates a spatial index LAX file for fast spatial queries\n* lasinfo - prints out a quick overview of the contents of a LAS file\n* lasmerge - merges several LAS or LAZ files into a single LAS or LAZ file\n* lasprecision - analyses the actual precision of the LIDAR points\n* laszip - compresses the LAS files in a completely lossless manner\n* txt2las - converts LIDAR data from ASCII text to binary LAS format\n\nThe 2023 version includes also: `lasoptimize64, las2dem64, las2iso64, las2shp64, las2tin64, las3dpoly64, lasboundary64, lascanopy64, lasclassify64, lasclip64, lascolor64, lascontrol64, lascopy64, lasdatum64, lasdistance64, lasduplicate64, lasgrid64, lasground64, lasground_new64, lasheight64, lasintensity64, laslayers64, lasnoise64, lasoverage64, lasoverlap64, lasreturn64, lassort64, lassplit64, lasthin64, lastile64, lastrack64, lasvdatum64, lasvoxel64`. See the License for terms of use for these tools. [The native Linux version of LAStools](https://rapidlasso.de/release-of-lastoolslinux/) does not currently support multi-core processing.\n\nIn Puhti, only the command line tools are available, without the graphical user interface.\n\n### Using a licensed version\n\nCSC provides only the \"free\" version of LAStools. If you have your own license for LAStools, it can be used also in Puhti. \n\nFor using the 2023 native Linux version, copy the license file to your projects projappl directory in Puhti and provide the license file location as environment variable before using the tools:\n\n```\nexport LAStoolsLicenseFile=/projappl/project_200xxxx/yyy/lastoolslicense.txt\n```\n\n**Alternative:** Also using the licensed Windows version is possible with wine (Windows emulator). You can install the .exe files yourself for your project. Download and unzip __LAStools__ to your [projappl disk area](../computing/disk.md).\n\n```\ncd /projappl/<your_project>\nwget https://lastools.github.io/download/LAStools.zip\nunzip LAStools.zip\n```\n\nThen add your license file to the /bin folder and you can start running the __.exe__ files with __wine64__\n\nNotice you can only use the 64-bit versions of the tools with wine64\n\nHere is an example of running __lasinfo64.exe__ with __wine64__\n\n```\nmodule load wine\nwine64 lasinfo64.exe -i <LAS file>\n```\n\n\n### Finnish National Land Survey's lidar data in Puhti\n\nThe Finnish national [lidar data](https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/maps-and-spatial-data/expert-users/product-descriptions/laser-scanning-data) is already stored in Puhti. You can find it from filepath: __/appl/data/geo/mml/laserkeilaus__. [More info](https://research.csc.fi/gis_data_in_csc_computing_env).\n\n### LAStools with many files\n\nIf you are processing large number of lidar files with LAStools, it is possible in Puhti to process the files in parallel. \n\n* For using up to 40 cores (=1 node in Puhti), the best option would be using GNU parallel - see [CSC GDAL parallel example](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/gdal) for details.\n* For multi-node usage, see [Tutorial: GNU Parallel workflow for many small, independent runs](../support/tutorials/many.md).\n\n## License \n\nFor information on the legal use and licensing of LAStools, please read the [LAStools LICENSE](https://lastools.github.io/LICENSE.txt).\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nIf you use this software on Puhti, please acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
