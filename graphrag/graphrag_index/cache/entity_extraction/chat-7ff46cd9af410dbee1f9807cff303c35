Thus, in order to reliably access a pod, its IP\naddress must be tracked and stored. Service objects do just that, and as\na result, they provide a consistent network identity to pods:\n\n*`service.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: serve\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - name: 8081-tcp\n    port: 8081\n    protocol: TCP\n    targetPort: 8080\n  selector:\n    pool: servepod\n```\n\nThis service will redirect TCP traffic internally from port 8081 in the project\nto the port 8080 of the pods having their labels listed in `spec.selector`. In this\ncase, traffic is redirected to the pods with the label `pool: servepod`. If\nthere are multiple pods matching `spec.selector`, then traffic is split\nbetween the pods. By default, splitting is done in a round-robin manner.\n\nThe only required field in the `spec.ports` field is `port`. Omitting\n`protocol` defaults it to TCP, and omitting `targetPort` defaults to the\nvalue of `port`.\n\nLet us ensure that the service is defined by launching a remote shell in the\ncontainer running in the pod `mypod` and querying the internal DNS service:\n\n```bash\n$ oc rsh mypod\nsh-4.2$ nslookup serve\nServer:\t\t172.30.0.10\nAddress:\t172.30.0.10#53\n\nName:\tserve.test-sidecar.svc.cluster.local\nAddress: 172.30.103.178\n\n```\n\n## Route\n\nThe _route_ object is an OpenShift extension to Kubernetes that routes HTTP\ntraffic from the internet (or whichever network the OpenShift cluster is\nconnected to) to services in the OpenShift cluster.\n\n*`route.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1\nkind: Route\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n  name: myservice\n  annotations:\n    haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist: 192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.1\nspec:\n  host: <myroute>.2.rahtiapp.fi\n  to:\n    kind: Service\n    name: serve\n    weight: 100\n```\n\nThis route redirects traffic from the internet to the service in the cluster\nwhose `metadata.name` equals `spec.to.name`.\n\n* You need to replace `<myroute>` with any value that is a valid DNS name (It is recommended is to use the project name).\n\nIn the particular route also allows traffic only from the subnet `192.168.1.0/24` and\nthe IP `10.0.0.1`. Security-wise, it is highly encouraged to utilize IP\nwhitelisting for services that are not meant to be visible to the entire\ninternet.\n\n* In order to be able to connect, you need to add (or replace) your own IP or a subnet mask that contains your IP. A second option is to delete the annotation altogether, this will allow anyone in the world to connect. \n\nYou can now go to your browser and type the address you set: `<myservice>.2.rahtiapp.fi`. It should return you the Apache test page:\n\n![Apache test page](../img/Apache-test-page.png)\n\n!!! warning\n\n    If the whitelist entry is malformed, OpenShift will discard the whitelist\n    and allow all traffic.\n\nBy default, the hostname is `metadata.name` + `-` + `project name`\n+ `.2.rahtiapp.fi` unless otherwise specified in `spec.host`.\n\nSo far we have set up a pod, a service and a route. If the physical server\nwhere the pod lives gets shut down, you have to manually restart the pod using\n`oc create -f pod.yaml`. The _ReplicationController_ and _ReplicaSet_ objects are\na mechanism that will, roughly speaking, do that for the user.\n\n## ReplicationController\n\n!!! Warning \"ReplicationControlers deprecated\"\n    ReplicationControlers, alongside DeploymentConfigs are deprecated in current versions of OpenShift OKD. Follow [convert DeploymentConfig to Deployment](https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:replace-deprecated-deploymentconfigs-deployments/resource/resources:convert-deploymentconfig-deployment).\n\nA ReplicationController ensures that there are `spec.replicas` number of pods\nwhose labels match the `spec.selector` running in the cluster. If there are too many,\nReplicationController shuts down the extra ones, and if there are too few,\nit starts up pods according to the `spec.template` field. Actually, the\ntemplate field is exactly the pod described in `pod.yaml`, except the fields\n`apiVersion` and `kind` are missing.\n\n*`ReplicationController.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ReplicationController\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n  name: blogtest\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
