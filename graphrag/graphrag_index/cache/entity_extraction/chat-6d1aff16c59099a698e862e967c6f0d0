Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

The analysis is based on the multinomial-Dirichlet model. \n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2.1 \n\n## Usage\n\nTo use BayeScan, first run command\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nAfter that you can launch BayeScan with a command like:\n\n```bash\nbayescan_2.1 -threads 1 test_binary_AFLP.txt \n```\n\nWith bayescan_2.1, it is important to define the number of threads\nalways explicitly. This is because, by default, BayeScan tries\nto use all available cores.\n\nOn Puhti, BayeScan tasks should be executed as batch jobs.\nBelow is a sample batch job file for BayeScan:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=bayescan\n#SBATCH --account=project_XXXXXX\n#SBATCH --time=08:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem=6G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n\nmodule load biokit\n\nbayescan_2.1 -threads ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} test_binary_AFLP.txt > bayescan_omp.out\n```\n\nThe script above reserves 8 hours of computing time, 6 GB of memory and 4 computing cores. The `XXXXXX` in the `--account` definition\nshould be replaced with the ID number of your computing project. The job can be submitted to the batch job system with command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch script\n```\n\nDon't use BayeScan with more than 8 cores (except if you have verified that your task really benefits from larger core numbers).\n\nMore instructions for running batch jobs can be found form [CSC batch job instructions](../computing/running/getting-started.md)\n\n## More information\n\n* [BayeScan home page](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/index.html)\n* [BayeScan manual](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/files/BayeScan2.1_manual.pdf)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
