Allas\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/allas/allas-tutorial.html\n---\n\n# Using Allas in CSC's HPC environment\n\nBefore the actual exercise, open a view to the Allas service in your browser using the Puhti web interface.\n\n1. Go to <https://www.puhti.csc.fi> and login with your account.\n2. Configure an Allas S3 connection using the _Cloud storage configuration_ tool.\n   - You need to first authenticate by providing your CSC password.\n   - If you have several projects available, choose one that you want to use in this exercise.\n3. Once you've configured a connection, select `s3allas-project_<id>` from the _Files_ dropdown menu in the top navigation bar. Replace `<id>` with the number of the project you chose to use (e.g. 2001234).\n4. During the exercise, you can use this web interface to get another view to the buckets and objects in Allas.\n\n## 1. Login to Puhti\n\n1. Login to Puhti (open a login node shell if using the web interface):\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi    # replace <username> with your CSC username\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. In Puhti, check your environment with the command:\n\n```bash\ncsc-workspaces\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Move to the `/scratch` directory of your project\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/<project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Create your own subdirectory named with your username:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p $USER\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Move to the directory:\n\n```bash\ncd $USER\n```\n\n## 2. Download data with `wget`\n\n1. Next, download a dataset and uncompress it\n   - The dataset contains some pythium genomes with related BWA indexes\n\n```bash\nwget https://a3s.fi/course_12.11.2019/pythium.tgz\ntar -xzvf pythium.tgz  \ntree pythium\n```\n\n## 3. Using Allas\n\n1. Open a connection to Allas:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf \n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. If you have several Allas projects available, select the same project as earlier\n\n### Upload case 1: `rclone`\n\n1. Upload the data from Puhti to Allas with `rclone`:\n\n```bash\nrclone -P copyto pythium allas:$USER-genomes-rc/\n```\n\n- How long did the data upload take?\n- What was the transfer rate?\n- How long would it take to transfer 100 GiB assuming the same speed?\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Study what you have uploaded to Allas with the commands:\n\n```bash\nrclone lsd allas:\nrclone ls allas:$USER-genomes-rc/\nrclone lsl allas:$USER-genomes-rc/\nrclone lsf allas:$USER-genomes-rc/\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Check how this looks like in the Puhti web interface. Open a browser and go to <https://www.puhti.csc.fi/>\n4. In the Puhti web interface, go to the _Files_ app and select `s3allas-project_<id>` to list the buckets of your project (replace `<id>` as needed).\n5. Locate your own `$USER-genomes-rc` bucket and download one of the uploaded fasta files to your local computer\n\n💡 You can read more about moving files at Docs CSC: [Copying files using scp](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/scp/) and [Moving data with rclone](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-move-data-between-puhti-and-allas/#move-data-with-rclone)\n\n### Upload case 2: `a-put`\n\n1. Upload the pythium directory from Puhti to Allas using a-commands\n2. Case 1: Store everything as a single object (replace `<project number>` with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234):\n\n```bash\na-put pythium      \na-list\na-list <project number>-puhti-SCRATCH\na-info <project number>-puhti-SCRATCH/$USER/pythium.tar\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Case 2: Each subdirectory (species) as a separate object (replace `<project number>` with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234):\n\n```bash\na-put pythium/*\na-list <project number>-puhti-SCRATCH \na-check pythium/*\na-info <project number>-puhti-SCRATCH/$USER/pythium/pythium_vexans.tar\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Case 3: Use a custom bucket name (replace `<project number>` with your project number, e.g. 2001234):\n\n```bash\na-put pythium/* -b <project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\na-list <project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
