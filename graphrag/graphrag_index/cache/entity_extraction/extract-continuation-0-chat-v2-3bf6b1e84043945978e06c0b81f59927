In these cases\nyou should consider using a node with fast local disk.  For details, please see the User Guide: \n[Creating a batch job script for Puhti](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md)\n\nLow efficiency could also be due to reserving more than one core and the application\nscaling poorly. Check especially if the percentage matches the number of cores reserved,\n*e.g.* 25% with four cores or 12,5% with eight cores *etc*. This is typically due to the\napplication only using one core. Check if the application can really use more than one core, \nor if you have set the corresponding application parameter correctly. \n\n```text\nCPU Efficiency: 12.48% of 06:56:08 core-walltime\n```\n\nAlso check the actual utilized memory and set the memory reservation for the next run\naccordingly, but leave some safety buffer, e.g. few GB. Fore example, in the following\njob, the memory request has been way too large (92GB requested vs. 6GB used).\n\n```text\nMemory Utilized: 5.98 GB\nMemory Efficiency: 6.25% of 92.59 GB\n```\n\nThe other command to check the status and resource usage of past jobs is **sacct**. It is handy\nwhen you want to see the status of many jobs (*e.g* all the subjobs of an array job).\nCommand **seff** will only show one job at a time.\n\n```text\nsacct\n```\nThe information shown by default includes the state of the jobs (PENDING/RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED) \nand the jobid. \n\nYou can also specify which fields to show with the -o option:\n```text\nsacct -o jobid,jobname,ntasks,ReqNodes,allocnodes,reqcpus,alloccpus,reqmem,maxrss,timelimit,elapsed,state -j <jobid>\n```\nBy default **sacct** only shows jobs run on current date. You can select the start date\nwith option -S.\n```text\nsacct -S <YYYY-MM-DD>\n```\nPlease note, that the `sacct` command is heavy on the queuing system, so don't build scripts that\nrun it repeatedly.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Getting familiar with a new program\n\nHere are some useful steps when familiarizing yourself with a new program.\n\n- Read the manual\n- It may be helpful to first try run the program interactively to find the correct command line options\n    - This allows to use `top` to get rough a estimate on memory use etc.\n- If developers provide some test or example data, run it first\n    - Make sure the results are as expected\n- You can use the test partition to check your batch job script\n    - Limits : 15 min, 2 nodes\n    - Job turnaround usually very fast\n    - Can be useful to spot typos, missing files *etc.* before submitting a job that will spend long in the queue\n- Before very large runs, it’s a good idea do a smaller trial run\n    - Check that results are as expected\n    - Check resource usage after test run and adjust accordingly \n    - Try different core numbers and see how the software scales\n\n### Troubleshooting checklist\n\nStart with these if your job fails:\n\n1. Did the job run out of time?\n2. Did the job run out of memory?\n3. Did the job actually use resources you specified?\n    - Problems in the batch job script can cause parameters to be ignored and default values getting used instead\n4. Did it fail immediately or did it run for some time?\n    - Jobs failing immediately are often due to something simple like \n      typos in command line, missing inputs, bad parameters *etc.*\n5. Check the error file captured by the batch job script\n6. Check any other error files and logs the program may have produced\n7. Error messages can sometimes be long, cryptic and a bit intimidating, \n   but try skimming through them and see if you can spot something \n   ”human readable” instead of ”nerd readable”\n    - Often you can spot the actual problem easily if you go through the \n      whole message. Something like ”required input file so-and-so missing” \n      or ”parameter X out of range” *etc.*\n\nIf you can't figure it out, please don't hesitate to contact us at\n**servicedesk@csc.fi**. Remember to include relevant information like what\nprogram you were trying to run on which server etc.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment where users can run batch job scripts and check the status of jobs using commands like sacct and seff)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER GUIDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The User Guide provides detailed instructions on creating batch job scripts for Puhti, including optimizing CPU and memory usage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SACCT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sacct is a command used in the Puhti computing environment to check the status and resource usage of past jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEFF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Seff is a command used in the Puhti computing environment to show the efficiency of a single job, including CPU and memory utilization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICDESK@CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service desk email for CSC, where users can seek help for issues encountered while running programs on Puhti or other CSC computing environments)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>USER GUIDE<|>The User Guide provides instructions specifically for users of the Puhti computing environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>SACCT<|>Sacct is a command available in the Puhti computing environment for checking job statuses<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>SEFF<|>Seff is a command available in the Puhti computing environment for checking job efficiency<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>SERVICDESK@CSC.FI<|>Users of the Puhti computing environment are directed to contact servicedesk@csc.fi for support<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
