Once the virtual machine is up and running, we copy the OpenStack \n   RC File v3 for accessing to cPouta/ePouta in the virtual machine. If you \n   do not have such file yet, please refer to\n   [this guide](install-client.md#configure-your-terminal-environment-for-openstack)\n   to obtain a copy.\n   ```bash\n   scp <project_name_here>-openrc.sh cloud-user@<floating_ip>:/home/cloud-user/\n   ```\n   Login into the virtual machine and use the file to load your \n   credentials.\n   ```bash\n   source <project_name_here>-openrc.sh\n   ```\n\n3. In order to host the image obtained from the snapshot, we need to \n   initialize properly the ephemeral storage. To do so, please refer to\n   [our guide](ephemeral-storage.md). After this\n   step, we assume the ephemeral disk is mounted in _/mnt_.\n4. Next, we need to equip the virtual machine with some basic tools we \n   will need.\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python3 python3-virtualenv screen qemu-img\n   ```\n   We create a python-3 virtual environment, which we will use to interact \n   with cPouta/ePouta, and we enter in it.\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv-3 env\n   source env/bin/activate\n   ```\n   Now we install the actual tools we need to talk with cPouta/ePouta.\n   ```bash\n   pip install python-openstackclient==3.11.0 openstacksdk==0.9.17 os-client-config==1.27.0 osc-lib==1.6.0\n   ```\n   5. Next, we download the image we obtained taking the snapshot. Move to \n   the ephemeral storage directory.\n   ```bash\n   cd /mnt\n   ```\n   Though it is not required, at this point we recommend opening a _screen_ \n   session, which allows to keep a process running in background, i.e., \n   without the need of waiting for its completion before closing the \n   terminal.\n   ```bash\n   screen -S converter\n   ```\n   We now issue the command to download the image obtained from the \n   snapshot.\n   ```bash\n   openstack image save --file myVmSnapshotRaw.raw <id_of_myVmSnapshot>\n   ```\n   Given the size of the image, the process will take few minutes. We can \n   exit the screen session by pressing CTRL+A followed by CTRL+D. We can \n   re-enter the screen session any time typing:\n   ```bash\n   screen -r converter\n   ```\n6. Once the previous command has finished, it is time to convert the \n   image.\n   ```bash\n   qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 myVmSnapshotRaw.raw myVmSnapshotQcow2.qcow2\n   ```\n   As previously mentioned, the qcow2 format will store only the actual \n   customer data instead of storing a 1-to-1 copy of the root disk. If the \n   size of the customer data is considerably smaller than the total \n   capacity of the root disk, similarly the qcow2 image will be \n   considerably smaller than the raw image.\n\n7. Once the conversion is completed, the new image can be uploaded to \n   OpenStack.\n   ```bash\n   openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --file myVmSnapshotQcow2.qcow2 myVmSnapshotCompact \n   ```\n   If the operation is successful, we can remove the image in raw format from OpenStack.\n   ```bash\n   openstack image delete <id_of_myVmSnapshot>\n   ```\n   We may keep the auxiliary virtual machine for future image conversions, \n   or delete it right after its usage.\n   ```bash\n   openstack server delete <id_of_snapshotConverter>\n   ```\n\n## Uploading images\n\nYou can upload images either using the web interface or the\n_openstack_ command line tool.\n\nBefore uploading, you need to know what format the image you are\nuploading is. The most likely options are _qcow2_ and _raw_. You can\nfind out the type of the image using the _file_ command. This is what\na qcow2 image looks like:\n\n```bash\n$ file images/Ubuntu-15.10-Phoronix.qcow2\nimages/Ubuntu-15.10-Phoronix.qcow2: Qemu Image, Format: Qcow (v3), 10737418240 bytes\n```\n\nAnd this is what a raw image looks like:\n\n```bash\n$ file images/Ubuntu-14.04-old.raw\nimages/Ubuntu-14.04-old.raw: x86 boot sector; partition 1: ID=0x83, active, starthead 0, startsector 16065, 20948760 sectors, code offset 0x63\n```\n\nUpload using the command line:\n\n```bash\nopenstack image create --disk-format <disk format> --private --file <image file to upload> <name of image to create>\n```\n\nThis should upload the image. It takes a while before the image is usable.\n\nIf you prefer to use the web interface instead, you can upload images\nin the **Compute | Images** section by clicking the **Create\nImage** button:\n\n![Image upload\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenStack is a cloud computing platform that allows for the creation and management of large groups of virtual private servers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPouta/EPouta<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cPouta/ePouta are cloud services provided by CSC - IT Center for Science, offering computing and storage resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its ease of use and readability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QEMU-IMG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>qemu-img is a command-line tool for converting and managing virtual disk images used by QEMU, a hardware virtualization product)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCREEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Screen is a terminal multiplexer that allows for the management of multiple terminal sessions from a single window)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK IMAGE<|>EVENT<|>The process of creating, converting, and uploading images to OpenStack for use in virtual machines)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>OPENSTACK<|>Virtual machines are created and managed within the OpenStack platform<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPouta/EPouta<|>OPENSTACK<|>cPouta/ePouta are services that utilize OpenStack for cloud computing capabilities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>Python is used within virtual machines for programming and automation tasks<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QEMU-IMG<|>OPENSTACK IMAGE<|>qemu-img is used to convert virtual disk images for use in OpenStack<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCREEN<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>Screen is used to manage terminal sessions, which can include tasks related to virtual machines<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
