If you are not planning on using the API or command-line\ntools then you probably won't need any application credentials.\n\nApplication credentials are also very useful to create credentials with limited permissions. You can\ncreate credentials that are only allowed to get data of your project. You can also create\ncredentials that can only modify a specific instance or create new instances. It is also possible\nto create credentials that can do everything that you can.\n\nIt is important to remember that the application credentials are personal, which\nmeans that the application credentials are owned by a user account and all operations that the\ncredentials do is on behalf of the user that created the credentials. This means that if a user\nis removed from the project the user's credentials will stop working.\n\n## Creating application credentials\n\n1. Go to [Pukki's web-interface](https://pukki.dbaas.csc.fi/).\n2. Choose which project you want to use. (You will only see the projects that have DBaaS activated in [my.csc.fi](https://my.csc.fi).)\n3. Go to `Identitiy` -> `Application Credentials`.\n4. Press `Create Application Credential`. A dialog will open.\n\n    ![Create Application Credential](../../img/create-application-credential.png)\n\n5. It is a good idea to choose a descriptive `name` and `description`. Otherwise you might get confused\nin the future why the application credentials exist. It might be a good idea to name your first \ncredentials `Testing application credentials $TODAYS_DATE`.\n6. `Secret` should be a long random string that you should keep secret. If you leave this empty the\nservice will create a secret for you, this is probably the preferred method.\n7. It is a good idea to put an `expiration date` especially if you are testing the credentials only\nfor today.\n8. There are two roles, `reader` and `member`. Usually you want to use the `member` role. You can find\nout more in the [Using roles sections](#using-roles).\n9. `Access rules` are useful when you want to make credentials with fine-grained permissions.\nThis is particularly useful if you want to build a lot of automation around your databases. For example,\nyou can make a script that is only allowed to modify the users of a specific database or\ncredentials that are only allowed to create new instances. You can find more information about the\noptions in the [Using access rules section](#using-access-rules).\n10. The `Unrestricted (dangerous)` check-box will allow your application credentials to\ncreate new application credentials. This might be useful if you are a power-user of the CLI, but you\nshould probably not give an application or automation credentials that have this permission.\n11.  Once you have created the application credentials you can either download the credentials as a \nfile that you can source or `.yaml` file, or alternatively add the secret to your secret manager. The\nsecret key will not be possible to be read once you have completed the credential creation process.\n    If you download the application credentials you will get a file that contains something like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n    export OS_AUTH_TYPE=v3applicationcredential\n    export OS_AUTH_URL=https://pukki.dbaas.csc.fi:5000/v3\n    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3\n    export OS_REGION_NAME=\"pukki_dbaas\"\n    export OS_INTERFACE=public\n    export OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n    export OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n    ```\n\n    If you source the file you can use it together with with [OpenStack command-line tools](cli.md).\n\n14. It is a good idea to test that the application credentials are allowed to do what you expect them\nto be able to do. It is also a good idea to verify that they are **NOT** allowed to do what you expect them\nnot to be allowed to do.\n\n<!-- 8. Choosing a role, you should choose `member`. The `reader` role does not work as one would expect\nat the point of writing there is no difference between reader and member role when it comes to\nmanaging your databases at the moment. In the future the reader role might become a read-only user\nrole. -->\n\n## Using roles\n\nThere are two roles available; `reader` and `member`. The reader role is a read-only role while the\nmember role is allowed to make changes to your project.\n\n* `reader` role can only collect data from your project but not make any changes. This is good if you\nwant to create a script that checks the state of your services. Sometimes it is nice to have a default\nreader account that you use for day-to-day operations when you collect information so that you can be\nsure that you can't do any destructive commands.\n* `member` role is the normal user role. It can do everything that the `reader` role can, but it can\nalso make changes to the system. When you login into the web-interface you have the `member` role\nenabled.\n\n## Using access rules \n\nIt is possible to create application credentials that are limited to only do selected API-calls.\nTo find out which API-calls are available, you can take a look at\n[OpenStack Database API](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/database/).\n\nFor example, if you want to create application credentials that only have permission to list\nyour instances, you can add the permission:\n\n```\n- service: database\n  method: GET\n  path: /v1\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK COMMAND-LINE TOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tools used for interacting with OpenStack services via the command line)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUKKI'S WEB-INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The web interface for managing DBaaS projects and application credentials at CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY.CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The portal for accessing and managing projects that have DBaaS activated in CSC's environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>READER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A role in OpenStack that allows only data collection from projects without making changes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEMBER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A role in OpenStack that allows making changes to the system in addition to data collection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK DATABASE API<|>ORGANIZATION<|>API reference for managing database instances and performing other database-related operations in OpenStack)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUKKI'S WEB-INTERFACE<|>MY.CSC.FI<|>Pukki's web-interface is used to manage DBaaS projects that are activated in my.csc.fi<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>READER<|>MEMBER<|>The member role includes all capabilities of the reader role, with additional permissions to make changes<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
