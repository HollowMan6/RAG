When using Dask, two main decisions have to be made for running code in Parallel. \n\n1. **How to make the code parallel?** Dask provides several options, inc [Dask DataFrames](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframe.html), [Dask Arrays](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array.html) and [Dask Delayed](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/delayed.html). This decision depends on the type of analyzed data and already existing code. Additionally Dask has support for scalable machine learning with [DaskML](https://ml.dask.org/).\n2. **How to run the parallel code?** Again Dask supports several options: default local cluster and many different [Distributed Clusters](https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/) for [Cloud](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/deploying-cloud.html), [Kubernetes](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/deploying-kubernetes.html) and [supercomputers](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/deploying-hpc.html) etc. This depends on available hardware. Changing from one cluster to another is code-wise relatively easy. So when starting with Dask, it is recommended to first use a local cluster and go to more advanced Distributed Clusters after understanding the basics.\n\nIn this tutorial we use Delayed functions. Delayed functions are useful in parallelising existing code. This approach delays function calls and creates a graph of the computing process. From the graph, Dask can then divide the work tasks to different workers whenever parallel computing is possible. Two options suitable for supercomputers are provided for running Dask clusters: single node using a local cluster and multiple nodes using SLURMCluster.\n\nKeep in mind that the other ways of code parallelisation might suit better in different use cases. For Dask DataFrames, see [CSC dask-geopandas example](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/edit/master/python/dask_geopandas) and for Dask Arrays [CSC STAC example with Xarray](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/edit/master/python/STAC). \n\n## Single-node parallellisation with delayed functions and a local cluster\n\nThis way you can utilize one full computing node's worth of CPUs (40 in Puhti)\n\n__batch job file__\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=DaskSingleNode\n#SBATCH --account=<YOUR-PROJECT>\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\n### Load the python-data module\nmodule load python-data\n\n### Run the Dask example\nsrun python dask_singlenode.py \n```\n\n\n__simple python script__\n```python\nfrom dask import delayed\nfrom dask import compute\n\nlist_of_delayed_functions = []\ndatasets =['/data/dataset1','/data/dataset2','/data/dataset3','/data/dataset4']\n\ndef processDataset(dataset):\n    ### Do something to the dataset \n    results = dataset\n    return results\n\nfor dataset in datasets:\n    list_of_delayed_functions.append(delayed(processDataset)(dataset))\n\n### This starts the execution with the resources available\ncompute(list_of_delayed_functions)\n\n```\n\n## Multi-node parallellisation with delayed functions and SLURMCluster\n\nTo achieve parallellisation over multiple HPC computing nodes, use SLURMCluster from [Dask-Jobqueue library](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/).\n\nThe workflow with this approach is that you first submit a master job, which then submits further worker SLURM jobs to the queuing system. \nOnce at least some worker SLURM jobs have started, the master sets up a Dask cluster with Dask workers. \nIt also distributes the work to the workers and waits for their results. Dask workers do the actual computing.\nIn one worker SLURM job, Dask can have 1 or several workers.\n\nThe master SLURM job can have limited resources (1 core, little memory), but it should reserve enough time for all analysis to end, plus potential queuing time for worker SLURM jobs. \n\n__master job batch job file__\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=DaskMultinode\n#SBATCH --account=<YOUR-PROJECT>\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\n### Load the python-data module\nmodule load python-data\n\n### Run the Dask example. We also give script the project name and number of worker SLURM jobs\nsrun python dask_multinode.py <YOUR-PROJECT>\n```\n\nThe worker jobs are defined inside the Python file started by master SLURM job, for further details see: [Dask Jobqueue configurations documentation](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/configuration-setup.html).\n\n* `cores` - How many cores per node to use? In bigger jobs one worker SLURM job should fill the whole HPC node, ie 40 cores in Puhti.\n* `processes` - How many Python processes per node to use?\n* `memory`- How much memory per node to use? This should be enough for all Dask workers in that node. If unsure, try with cores*6Gb.\n* `walltime` - Reserve enough time as one worker may handle several delayed functions, if the number of workers is smaller than the number of delayed functions\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DASK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dask is a versatile Python library for scalable analytics, providing options for parallel computing and scalable machine learning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DASK DATAFRAMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Dask module for handling large datasets in a way similar to Pandas dataframes but with parallel computing capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DASK ARRAYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Dask module for large-scale array computing, mimicking NumPy arrays but with the ability to work on larger-than-memory datasets in parallel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DASK DELAYED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Dask feature that allows for parallel computing by delaying function calls and creating a graph of computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DASKML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Dask module for scalable machine learning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISTRIBUTED CLUSTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clusters supported by Dask for running parallel code, including options for Cloud, Kubernetes, and supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURMCLUSTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Dask-Jobqueue library feature for running Dask clusters on multiple nodes using SLURM)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC DASK-GEOPANDAS EXAMPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An example provided by CSC for using Dask with geopandas for geospatial data processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC STAC EXAMPLE WITH XARRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An example provided by CSC for using Dask with STAC and Xarray for spatio-temporal asset catalog data processing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DASK DATAFRAMES<|>DASK<|>Dask DataFrames is a module of Dask for handling large datasets with parallel computing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DASK ARRAYS<|>DASK<|>Dask Arrays is a module of Dask for large-scale array computing in parallel<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DASK DELAYED<|>DASK<|>Dask Delayed is a feature of Dask that supports parallel computing by delaying function calls<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DASKML<|>DASK<|>DaskML is a module of Dask for scalable machine learning<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISTRIBUTED CLUSTERS<|>DASK<|>Distributed Clusters are supported by Dask for running parallel code on various platforms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURMCLUSTER<|>DASK<|>SLURMCluster is a feature of Dask-Jobqueue for running Dask clusters on SLURM<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC DASK-GEOPANDAS EXAMPLE<|>DASK<|>The CSC Dask-Geopandas example demonstrates using Dask for geospatial data processing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC STAC EXAMPLE WITH XARRAY<|>DASK<|>The CSC STAC example with Xarray shows how to use Dask for processing spatio-temporal asset catalog data<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
