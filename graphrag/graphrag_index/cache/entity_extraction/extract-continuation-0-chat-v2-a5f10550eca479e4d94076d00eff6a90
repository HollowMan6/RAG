How to speed up jobs\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 5\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/throughput/tune_performance.html\n---\n\n# Application performance\n\n> This exercise is done on **Mahti**, which requires that\n\n- you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n- your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Mahti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\n## Overview\n\n💬 In this exercise, you will optimize the performance of a real simulation use\ncase by tuning the number of cores used and ratio between MPI tasks and OpenMP\nthreads. As an example application, we will use the [CP2K](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/cp2k/)\nsoftware. The details of the code and what it does is not important for the\ncompletion of this exercise. Just take it as an example parallel program that\nuses hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization.\n\n## Download a sample input file\n\n1. Create and enter a suitable scratch directory on Puhti (replace `<project>`\n   with your CSC project, e.g. `project_2001234`):\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER/app-perf\n   cd /scratch/<project>/$USER/app-perf\n   ```\n\n2. Download a sample input file:\n \n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/cp2k.inp\n   ```\n\n💬 Reading/understanding the contents of this input file is not important for\nthe sake of completing this exercise.\n\n## Scalability test\n\n💬 You should first check how many CPU nodes can be used efficiently to run the\nexample simulation.\n\n1. Modify the following batch script to request 1 node and save it into a file\n   `cp2k.sh` using, e.g., `nano`:\n   \n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   #SBATCH --partition=medium\n   #SBATCH --account=<project>    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   #SBATCH --nodes=<N>            # replace <N> with the number of nodes to run on\n   #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128  # Mahti has 128 CPU cores per node\n   #SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n\n   module purge\n   module load gcc/9.4.0 openmpi/4.1.2 cp2k/2023.2\n   srun cp2k.psmp -i cp2k.inp\n   ```\n\n2. Submit the batch script:\n   \n   ```bash\n   sbatch cp2k.sh\n   ```\n\n3. Once the job has completed, you may use the program's internal timer to\n   check how many seconds it took to run the simulation:\n\n   ```bash\n   grep \"CP2K \" slurm-<jobid>.out | awk '{print $7}'\n   ```\n\n4. Repeat the job for the number of nodes listed below and complete the table!\n   Calculate the speedup by dividing the previous elapsed time with the elapsed\n   time obtained using twice as many nodes:\n\n   | Number of nodes | Elapsed time (s) | Speedup                         |\n   |:---------------:|:----------------:|:-------------------------------:|\n   |1                |                  | -                               |\n   |2                |                  | *t*<sub>1</sub>/*t*<sub>2</sub> |\n   |4                |                  | *t*<sub>2</sub>/*t*<sub>4</sub> |\n   |8                |                  | *t*<sub>4</sub>/*t*<sub>8</sub> |\n\n☝🏻 Remember that the speedup should be *at least* 1.5x when you double the\nnumber of cores! This is important to ensure that the CPU resources are used\nefficiently.\n\n💭 To how many nodes is the job able to scale up to efficiently? Using that\nnode count, proceed to the next part!\n\n## Assess optimal thread–task balance\n\n💬 The performance of software using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism may be \nfurther improved by running multiple OpenMP threads per MPI task. The optimal\nratio between the number of tasks and threads varies for each program and job\ninput and should be tested.\n\n☝🏻 To run multiple threads, one needs to set `--cpus-per-task`. The default\nis one CPU (thread) per task. To use all 128 physical cores in a Mahti node,\nthe value of `--ntasks-per-node` multiplied by `--cpus-per-task` should equal\n128 (40 on Puhti). Most applications also require setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS`\nenvironment variable to be equal to the number of threads per task.\n\n1. Copy the following script into a file `job.sh` using, e.g., `nano`:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   #SBATCH --partition=medium\n   #SBATCH --account=<project>   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   #SBATCH --nodes=1\n   #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128\n   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n   #SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n\n   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}\n\n   module purge\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a computing service provided by CSC that requires a user account and project access for utilization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides computing services, including Mahti, and requires users to have an account and project access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CP2K<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CP2K is a software application used for simulation purposes, utilizing hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is another computing service mentioned in the context of creating a scratch directory for performance optimization activities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC<|>Mahti is a service provided by CSC, indicating that users need an account and project access from CSC to use Mahti<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CP2K<|>MAHTI<|>CP2K is used as an example application for optimizing performance on the Mahti computing service<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti, like Mahti, is a computing service that requires CSC account and project access, indicating it is also provided by CSC<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
