Allas\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 1\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/allas/tutorial_allas-file-transfer.html\n---\n\n# Basic usage of Allas\n\n## Accessing Allas via the Puhti web interface\n\n1. Go to the Puhti web interface: <https://www.puhti.csc.fi>.\n2. Login with your CSC user account (or Haka).\n3. Select *Cloud storage configuration* from the *Pinned Apps* view on the dashboard.\n4. Enter your CSC password to authenticate, then create an Allas S3 connection for the project you want to use for this exercise.\n   - You may skip the previous step if you've already configured a connection.\n\nðŸ’¡ Now you'll be able to browse your _buckets_ and _objects_ in Allas using the *Files* app!\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n1. From the *Files* dropdown menu in the top navigation bar, select `s3allas-project_<id>` where `<id>` is the number of your project (e.g. 2001234).\n2. Create a new bucket by pressing the *New Directory* button.\n   - Name it as `<id>_<username>`, in which `<id>` is again the number of your project and `<username>` is your CSC username. Note that you cannot use a bucket name that already exists!\n3. Open the created bucket by clicking it.\n4. Upload one file from your computer into the bucket (any file should do, but prefer a file that you can open in Puhti, e.g. a text file).\n\nðŸ’­ During the exercises, you can use this web interface to get another view to your buckets and objects in Allas.\n\n## Accessing Allas from Puhti\n\n### Preparations (if not done already)\n\n1. Login to `puhti.csc.fi` (open a login node shell if using the web interface)\n2. In Puhti, check your environment with the command\n\n```bash\ncsc-workspaces\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Move to the scratch directory of your project:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/<project>   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Create your own subdirectory named as your username (tip! your username is automatically stored in the environment variable `$USER`):\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p $USER\ncd $USER\n```\n\n### Connecting to Allas\n\n1. Open a connection to Allas with these commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf \n```\n\nðŸ’¡ It might take a while to run `module load allas`\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. If you have several projects with access to Allas available, select the one where you just created a bucket using the Puhti web interface\n3. Study what you have in Allas with [`a-commands`](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands/) and with [rclone](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/using_allas/rclone/):\n\n- With `a-commands`:\n\n```bash\na-list\na-list <id>_$USER             # replace <id> with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234\na-info <id>_$USER/<filename>  # replace <id> with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234, and <filename> with the file you uploaded\n```\n\n- With `rclone`:\n\n```bash\nrclone lsd allas:\nrclone ls allas:<id>_$USER\nrclone lsl allas:<id>_$USER\nrclone lsf allas:<id>_$USER\nrclone cat allas:<id>_$USER/<filename>\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Download to Puhti the file that you just uploaded from your local computer to Allas. This can be done in two ways:\n\n- With `a-commands`:\n\n```bash\na-get <id>_$USER/<filename>     # replace <id> with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234, and <filename> with the file you uploaded\n```\n\n- With `rclone`:\n\n```bash\nrclone copy allas:<id>_$USER/<filename> ./    # replace <id> with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234, and <filename> with the file you uploaded\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Open, edit and rename the file so that you can distinguish it from the original one\n6. Upload the new file to Allas:\n\n- With `a-commands`:\n\n```bash\na-put -b <id>_$USER <newfilename>   # replace <id> and <newfilename> accordingly\n```\n\nðŸ’­ Try running `a-put -h` to understand the command-line switch above and to find more information on options.\n\nðŸ’¬ With larger files it is good to include the option `-c` to enable `zstdmt` compression of the files.\n\n- With `rclone`:\n\n```bash\nrclone copy <newfilename> allas:<id>_$USER/   # replace <newfilename> and <id> accordingly\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 6\"}\n7.
