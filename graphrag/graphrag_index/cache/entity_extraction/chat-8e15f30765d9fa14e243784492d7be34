The first (and easiest) option is to use [the Puhti web interface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md).\n\n2. The second option is to create a SSH tunnel from a local PC to a compute node. As compute nodes are inaccessible via the Internet, \nthe tunnel needs to go through a login node. This is not possible with Windows PowerShell (it does not support jump servers), and therefore it is \nnot suitable for RStudio or Jupyter Notebook in Puhti. \nSSH tunnelling requires that you have [set up SSH keys](../../computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md). \n\nWith Linux, macOS and MobaXterm the SSH tunnelling works by default. PuTTy requires filling in the settings to PuTTy tabs, so it is slower and more complicated, but possible.\n\n## Workflow for using RStudio or Jupyter Notebook in Puhti\n\n**Using the Puhti Web Interface**\n\n* For instructions on this, [see the Puhti web interface documentation.](../../computing/webinterface/index.md)\n\n**Using SSH tunneling**\n\n* Start interactive session\n* Load suitable modules and start RStudio or Jupyter Notebook server\n* Create SSH tunnel from your PC to Puhti compute node\n* Open RStudio or Jupyter Notebook in local web browser\n\nMore detailed information on the different steps to launch RStudio or Jupyter Notebook using SSH tunneling is provided in the following. \n\n## Instructions for SSH tunneling\n\n### 1. Start interactive session\nStart an interactive session, for example with `sinteractive -i`. For more options and maximum limits see the [interactive usage page.](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md)\n\n### 2. Load module and start RStudio or Jupyter Notebook server\nIn the interactive session run:\n\n**RStudio**\n```text\nmodule load r-env\nstart-rstudio-server\n```\nThis set up works with any [r-env module](../../apps/r-env.md).\nIt is also possible to launch a multi-threaded RStudio session using `start-rstudio-server-multithread`, if you have specified multiple cores when starting an interactive session. \nDetails on using threading with R can be found on the [r-env main page](../../apps/r-env.md#improving-performance-using-threading).\n\n**Jupyter**\n\nJupyter notebooks can be used with the traditional Jupyter Notebook or the more advanced JupyterLab server.\n\nJupyter Notebook:\n\n```\nmodule load python-data \nstart-jupyter-server\n```\n\nJupyterLab:\n```\nmodule load python-data \nstart-jupyterlab-server\n```\n\nIt is also possible to use some other pre-installed [Python module](../../apps/python.md) than `python-data`, if it includes Jupyter. You can also use your [own custom Python environment with Jupyter Notebook.](#custom-python-environment-with-jupyter-notebook)\n\n***\n\nThis will start the RStudio, Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab server on the compute node and print out the instructions for next steps. \n\nKeep this terminal open as long as you are working, to keep the RStudio or Jupyter Notebook server running.\n\n### 3. Create SSH tunnel from your PC to Puhti compute node\n* With Linux, MacOS and MobaXterm, open a second SSH terminal on your local machine (do not connect to Puhti yet) and \nrun the SSH tunnelling command printed out by the RStudio or Jupyter Notebook start-up script. \nFor example `ssh -N -L 8787:localhost:42896 -J john@puhti.csc.fi john@r07c49.bullx`\n* With PuTTy see the [SSH tunnelling with PuTTy](#ssh-tunnelling-with-putty) instructions.\n* The command does not print out anything specific, unless you get some error, you likely succeeded.\n\nAlso keep this terminal open for as long as you are working to have remote access to RStudio.\n\n### 4. Open RStudio or Jupyter Notebook in local web browser \n* Open a web browser on your local machine and copy the URL printed out by the start-up script. For example: `http://localhost:8787/`  \n* For RStudio, insert the credentials printed out by the start-up script.\n\n### 5. Close the session\nOnce you have finished: \n\n* Exit RStudio or Jupyter Notebook server by entering `Ctrl + C` in the interactive terminal session on Puhti. \n* Close (`exit`) also the interactive session. \n* Close SSH tunnel with `Ctrl + C`.\n\n## Custom Python environment with Jupyter Notebook\n\nIf you want to use a custom Conda environment with Jupyter Notebook, the\nfollowing workflow could be used (adapted to your situation):\n\n```bash\n# Set up PROJAPPL environment variable, where to install your Conda environment. \n# Add your project here\nexport PROJAPPL=/projappl/project_xxx\n# Activate Conda commands\nmodule load bioconda\n# Create Conda environment with your packages\n# It is important to include the notebook package\nconda create --name gromacs-tutorials -c conda-forge -c bioconda gromacs=2020.4 matplotlib nglview notebook numpy requests pandas seaborn  \n# Activate the new Conda environment\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
