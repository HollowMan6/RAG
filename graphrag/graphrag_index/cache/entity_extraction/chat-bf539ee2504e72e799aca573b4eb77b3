(tried SSH)\n    ```\n\n    Please export the following environment variable as temporary workaround:\n\n    ```\n    export CTI_WLM_IMPL=slurm\n    export CTI_LAUNCHER_NAME=srun\n\n    module load gdb4hpc\n    ```\n\nYou can launch your application from the debugger command line interface using\nthe `launch` command.\n\n```bash\n$ dbg all> launch --launcher-args=\"<launch-args>\" \n                  --args=\"<args>\" \n                  --env=\"<name=value>\" <handle> <application>\n```\n\nwhere `launch-args` are the arguments for the launcher (i.e. Slurm options).\nYou can use this argument to specify the project to bill with\n`--account=<project>`. The parameters `--args` and `--env` allows you to pass\nparameters and define environment variables for your application. The handle is\na debugger variable array specifying the number of ranks in the application.\nFor example, an application with a handle of `$a{16}` will launch the\napplication with 16 ranks.\n\n??? example \"Example debug session\"\n    In the example debug session presented here, we launch an MPI hello world\n    application with 16 ranks.\n\n    ```bash\n    dbg all> launch $a{16} --launcher-args=\"--account=<project>\" ./myapp\n    Starting application, please wait...\n    Creating MRNet communication network...\n    Waiting for debug servers to attach to MRNet communications network...\n    Timeout in 400 seconds.

This is done using\nthe `attach` command.\n\n```bash\ndbg all> attach <handle> <jobstep>\n```\n\nThe `<jobstep>` parameter will typically be `<jobid>.0` if only one `srun`\ncommand is present in your job script.\nIf that is not the case, you can list your job steps with `sstat`.\n\n```bash\n$ sstat <jobid>\n```\n\nwhere the `<jobid>` can be determined via `squeue`. As an example, the debugger\ncommand to attach the debugger to job step `123456.0` will be\n\n```bash\ndbg all> attach $a 123456.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
