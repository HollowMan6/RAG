In order to create a Virtual Machine, check out [Creating a virtual machine in Pouta](../launch-vm-from-web-gui/).\n\n!!! info \"Password access disabled\"\n\n    None of the accounts in the default images provided by Pouta CSC have password login enabled by default. Only SSH keypair access is possible by default. This is done to improve security.\n\n## Keypair-based SSH connection\n\nFirst, you need to check the Virtual Machine status in the **Compute > Instances** view of the Pouta web interface.\n\n![VM Status check](../../img/pouta-instance-details.png)\n\n**Figure** The Instances view of the cPouta web interface.\n\nFind, under **Instance name**, the Virtual Machine that you want to connect to.\n\n* The **Power State** must be `Running`\n\n* It must have a `Floating IP` attached, write it down.\n\n!!! info\n    To access an ePouta instance, you can ssh on the private IP (ssh cloud-user@private-ip).\n\n* Check the name of the key under **Key Pair**. You will need the corresponding SSH secret key installed in your computer.\n\n    !!! Info \"Generate SSH public key from a SSH private key\"\n\n        If you have access to a SSH private key, it is possible to generate the corresponding public key by:\n\n        `ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`\n\n        This is useful to be sure which private key corresponds to which public one configured in Pouta.\n\n* Click in the machine name and check that there is a security group that allow SSH connections from your current IP. See the [security group](launch-vm-from-web-gui.md#firewalls-and-security-groups) article for more information on how to create a SSH security group.\n\n* Now you need to know which user name is configured in the Virtual Machine to let your SSH keypair to log in. Different distributions/images have different user names. Third-party images can use any user name, please check the respective documentation. For the default images provided by Pouta CSC, have a look to the [Images](./images.md#images) documentation article, the information there is kept up to date with any addition or change.\n\n!!! Info\n\n    It is a common practise for images, when you try to login as `root`, to get a message back telling you which username to use instead.\n\n    ```sh\n    $ ssh root@86.xxx.xxx.xxx\n    Please login as the user \"cloud-user\" rather than the user \"root\".\n    ```\n\nWith all the information ready you can now connect to the instance.\n\n### Linux, Mac and PowerShell\n\nIn Linux, Mac and most modern Windows, it is possible to use `ssh`:\n\n```sh\nssh <user_name>@<floating-ip> -i <secretkey>\n```\n\n#### ssh_config\n\nInstead of specifying the path, IP and user name each time you want to connect to the same Virtual Machine, you can write this formation in your ssh config file. Edit (or create if it is not there) the `~/.ssh/config` file, and add this content:\n\n```ini\nHost <machine_name>\nHostname <floating ip>\nUser <user_name>\nIdentityFile <private_key_with_path>\n```\n\n* In **Host** you should write the machine name (to later use it to connect using `ssh machine_name`).\n\n* In **Hostname** write the floating of the Virtual Machine.\n\n* In **User** the user name must be specified.\n\n* In **IdentityFile** the full path to the private key must be written, for example `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.\n\nCheck the manual page of [ssh_config](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config) for more information.\n\n!!! Info \"Agent forwarding\"\n    You can enable *agent forwarding* when connecting through SSH to a virtual machine by using the *-A* flag.\n\n        ssh -A cloud-user@public-ip\n\n    By enabling agent forwarding, you enable the ssh agent running on the remote Virtual Machine to make use of the keys which are loaded in the ssh agent of your local workstation. You can use this feature to use the \"Bastion host model\", where only one single machine, the bastion host, in the cluster has Floating IP and outside access, and the rest of the machines are accessed through the bastion.\n\n    1. Assign a floating IP to one of your instances\n    1. ssh to the instance enabling agent forwarding\n    1. ssh from this instance to the other instances in the network using their private IP\n\n    Using these steps, you need only a single public IP instead of one public IP for each of the instances.\n\n    **Warning**: using agent forwarding has some [security implications](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/ssh-agent-forwarding-vulnerability-and-alternative/#thevulnerability)\n\n### Putty\n\nOpen Putty, after following the instructions at [windows-putty](/cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui/#windows-putty) you should have a saved session with the private key stored on it.\n\n* Load the saved session.\n\n* Under **Host Name (or IP address)**, write the user name an `@` symbol and the floating IP of the instance like: `cloud@89.14.89.14`\n\n* Write a new name (like the machine name) under **Saved Sessions** and click save.\n\n* Click **Open**, a new window to the instance will be opened\n\nNext time you need to use Putty to connect this instance, you will just need to **Load** the corresponding saved session and click **Open**.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### port 22\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
