The smaller the image is, the faster it will be pulled, speeding up deployments, both in production and development environments. In addition, bigger images get deleted from the nodes cache sooner. The maximum size for an image stored in Rahti 2's internal registry is 5GB. Images over 1GB are already considered very big images.\n\n## Be mindful about what is added to the image\n\nThe first way to keep an image small is to by simply not adding unnecessary files. When developing is common to install full sources of libraries or other dependencies, for example the Linux kernel headers. These sources are not anymore necessary in production deployments.\n\n## Keep data out of the image\n\nImages should only contain the application's runtime. This means that the data needed to run the application should not be added to the image. This way not only the image is smaller, but we avoid a rebuild when the data changes. The data can be stored in an [external volume](../storage/persistent.md) (PVC) that will be attached to the Pod upon startup, or it can be stored in [Allas](../../../data/Allas/index.md) and downloaded during the startup or on demand when needed. Storing the data in Allas requires an extra logic in the application (or in a pre-load script) that understands where the data is and how to retrieve it.\ndata can be stored in a external volume (PVC) that will be attached to the Pod upon startup, or it can be stored in\n\n## Reduce the number of layers\n\nFor every `Dockerfile` instruction (`RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`, `EXPOSE`, ...), a new layer is added to the docker image. Each layer is stored as the difference from the previous one. This means that if some data is added in one layer, but removed in the next, the image will still contain said data. In order to see how much data each layer adds to the image, you may use:\n\n`docker history image_name`\n\nThere are 3 approaches to reduce the number of layers:\n\n* Combine layers in the `Dockerfile`. Sometimes there are several `RUN` instructions one after the other. They can be easily combined by using `&&`:\n\n```Dockerfile\nRUN apt update\n\nRUN apt install git\n```\n\nwill become:\n\n```Dockerfile\nRUN apt update && \\\n    apt install git\n```\n\n* Use multi stage builds (This feature was introduced in docker v17.05). The idea behind multi stage builds is to have several `FROM` commands in the same `Dockerfile`, each `FROM` starts a new stage in the build and does not carry the files from the previous stage, but allows copying files from the previous stages. The pattern used here is, to build the application in the first stage, and then in the second stage copy only the compiled application, leaving behind the sources and other compilation sub-products that we do not need to run the application. For example:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM golang:1.21\nWORKDIR /src\n\nRUN echo 'package main\\n\\\n\\nimport \"fmt\"\\nfunc main() {\\nfmt.Println(\"hello, world\")\\n}' >main.go\n\nRUN go build -o /bin/hello ./main.go && cat main.go\n\nFROM scratch\nCOPY --from=0 /bin/hello /bin/hello\nCMD [\"/bin/hello\"]\n```\n\nThe example was taken from the [Use multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) article in Docker's documentation.\n\n* Use [docker build --squash](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#squash). Docker will squash the image into a single layer. This means that if your `Dockerfile` produces multiple layers modifying the same files, only the final state of the files will be stored. Similarly, if a file is created in one layer and later deleted in another, the file will not be stored in the image.\n\n## Use a small base image\n\nWhen creating an image, choosing the base image is an important task. There are almost always multiple base images available for certain need. These base images can be very different in content, maintenance, security, size, etc. It is a good practice to evaluate the available images and do some comparisons between them. It is often not a good idea to take the first random image you find and put it to production. One base image that is very commonly used and has lots of documentation available is [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org).\n\n> Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on **musl libc** and **busybox**.\n\nCurrently the base image for Alpine (`docker.io/alpine`) is only 5.61 MB. For comparison, the sizes of Ubuntu's and CentOS' base images are 72.9 MB and 209 MB respectively. The biggest drawback that Alpine has versus other base images is that some applications are not compatible with [musl libc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musl) and require `glibc`. Alpine will also have a smaller selection of software available in the repositories than Ubuntu or CentOS.\n\n## Use `.dockerignore`\n\n`.dockerignore` works in the same way as `gitignore` does, creates a black list of files that will not be added to the image. This way is possible to exclude files that are not needed to run the application.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER IMAGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker images are used in development and production environments to speed up deployments by keeping the image size small and managing data and layers efficiently)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 2's internal registry has a maximum image size limit of 5GB, with images over 1GB considered very big)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKERFILE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dockerfile instructions such as RUN, COPY, CMD, EXPOSE add new layers to the docker image, affecting its size and efficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALPINE LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution that is commonly used as a base image for docker due to its small size)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a storage solution where data can be stored and retrieved by applications, requiring extra logic for data management)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER IMAGES<|>RAHTI 2<|>Docker images are stored in Rahti 2's internal registry, which has size limitations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER IMAGES<|>DOCKERFILE<|>Docker images are built using Dockerfile instructions, which determine the number of layers and size of the image<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER IMAGES<|>ALPINE LINUX<|>Alpine Linux is used as a base image for Docker images due to its small size and security features<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER IMAGES<|>ALLAS<|>Docker images can interact with Allas for data storage and retrieval, separating data from the application runtime<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
