In **Instance Count** you can specify the number of Virtual Machines to create. If in doubt, leave it to `1`.\n\n1. **Instance Boot Source**.Â Select \"Boot from image\" in the drop down menu.\n\n    !!! Info \"Cloud-native\"\n\n        In case you want to be more cloud-native, you can select the \"Boot fromÂ image (creates a new volume)\" option. This option creates a new persistent volume for your instance. In the event you accidentally delete yourÂ instance or it enters an unrecoverable state, the file system of your instance will be saved in this volume. You can later use this volume to boot up a new instance with the same filesystem state as the previous instance.\n\n    !!! Warning \"Please note\"\n\n        The \"Boot fromÂ image (creates a new volume)\" approach creates an additional volume which is billed normally as mentioned on our [pricing](https://research.csc.fi/billing-units) page.\n\n\n1. **Image Name**, this decides which Linux distribution to use. You can select the image that fits more your use case. The images provided by Pouta by default are regularly maintained up to date.\n\n1. Under the **Access & Security** tab, you need to configure two options. First you need to choose the name of the *Key Pair* you have created in the [**Preparatory Steps**](#setting-up-ssh-keys). Secondly you need to select under the [**Security Groups**](#firewalls-and-security-groups) the security group previously created.\n\n    ![Launch the instance access view](../img/launch_instance_access_security.png 'Launch cPouta instance network')\n\n!!! Warning  \n    If you click the \"+\" button, the window will close unexpectedly and a small window popup will appear:  \n    \n      ![Error plus button](../img/danger_keypairs.png 'Danger key pairs')  \n    \n    This is a known bug. Please refer to the [previous section](#setting-up-ssh-keys) on how to create your SSH keys.\n\n1. The **Networking** tab, make sure that your own network (your project name) is selected.\n\n    ![Launch the instance network view](../img/launch_instance_network.png 'Launch cPouta instance network')\n\n1. Finally, **Advanced Options** tab allows you to select a [**Server Group**](#server-groups)\n\nYou can click **Launch** to start the Virtual Machine creation.\n\n## Post creation step\n\nWhen a virtual machine is launched, it only gets a **private IP** (`192.168.XXX.XXX`). This means that meanwhile the machine can access the internet and other virtual machines in the same project, it can not be accessed from outside the project. To be able to access your virtual machine, you need to attach a **public IP address** to it.  \n\n!!! info\n    Associate a floating IP is only available for cPouta instances.\n\n1. Go to **Compute > Instances**, you should see your Virtual machine listed.\n\n1. On the right of your new machine's entry, under **Actions**, click in the drop down menu, and select **Associate Floating IP**.\n\n    ![Floating IP association options](../../img/associate-floating-ip-menu.png 'Associate floating IP menu')\n\n    **Figure** Floating IP association options\n\n1. Select an IP address under **IP Address**. If \"No floating IP addresses allocated\" show up, click in the plus to allocate a new IP to you project, you will need to add a description.\n\n1. Under **Port to be associated** select the virtual machine.\n\n1. Click in **Associate**.\n\n![Floating IP association dialog](../../img/pouta-assign-ip.png 'Assign IP')\n\n**Figure** Floating IP association dialog\n\n!!! warning \"IP billing\"\n\n    Allocated floating IPs are billed at the rate of 0,2 BU/hr. You can additionally read our [blog post](http://cloud.blog.csc.fi/2017/12/floating-ip-management.html)Â for management of floating IPs in a cPouta project.\n\nNow we can go to the [Connecting to your virtual machine](../connecting-to-vm) section and log in to the new Virtual Machine.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
