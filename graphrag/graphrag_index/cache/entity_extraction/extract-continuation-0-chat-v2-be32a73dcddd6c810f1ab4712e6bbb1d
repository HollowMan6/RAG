Workflow\nautomation saves human time and reduces manual errors. Workflows are frequently\nvery specific and one seldom finds a method that would work out of the box for a\ncertain application.\n\nThis page introduces some critical aspects you should consider when designing\nhigh-throughput workflows and helps you in narrowing down the right set of tools\nfor your use case. By carefully selecting the most appropriate technology stack,\nyour jobs will idle less in the queue, IO-operations will be more efficient and\nthe performance of the whole HPC system will remain stable and fast for all users.\n\n## General guidelines\n\n### Running and managing high-throughput jobs\n\nDoes your workflow involve running a substantial amount of (short) batch jobs?\nThis is a characteristic feature of high-throughput computing, frequently referred\nto as \"task farming\". However, it poses problems for batch job schedulers such as\nSlurm used in HPC systems. A large number of jobs (launched with `sbatch`) and job\nsteps (launched with `srun`) generate excess log data and slow down Slurm. Short\njobs have also a large scheduling overhead, meaning that an increasing fraction\nof the time will actually be spent in the queue instead of computing.\n\nTo enable high-throughput computing while avoiding the above issues, jobs and job\nsteps should be packed so that they can be executed with minimal invocations of\n`sbatch` and `srun`. The first and best option is to check whether the software\nyou're using comes with a [built-in option for farming-type workloads]. This\napplies for applications such as [CP2K][cp2k], [GROMACS][gmx], [LAMMPS][lmp], Python and R.\n\nIf integrated support for farming-type workloads is unavailable in your software,\nanother option is to use external tools such as [HyperQueue] or [GNU Parallel].\nBe aware that some tools, for example [FireWorks], still create a lot\nof job steps although they may allow you to conveniently pack your, possibly\ninterdependent, subtasks to be executed as a single batch job.\n\n!!!info \"Note\"\n    You do not need to issue `srun` if you intend to run *serial* jobs as a part\n    of your HTC workflow. A lot of job steps can be avoided just by dropping\n    unnecessary calls of `srun`.\n\nYou can use the flowchart below to narrow down the most appropriate technologies\nfor your high-throughput computing workflow. Please note that this is not a complete\nlist and other tools might also work for your use case. These tools usually work fine\nin HTC use cases with around 100 subtasks (or even more if subtasks utilize max. one\nnode each, see [HyperQueue]). If your workflow contains hundreds or thousands of\n*multi-node* subtasks, please [contact CSC Service Desk] as this may require special\nsolutions. However, don't hesitate to contact us also if you have any other concerns\nregarding how to implement your workflow.\n\n```mermaid\n%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '0.6rem'}}}%%\ngraph TD\n    C(Does your software have a built-in HTC option?) -->|Yes| D(\"Use if suitable for use case:<br><a href='/support/tutorials/gromacs-throughput/'>GROMACS</a>, <a href='/apps/cp2k/#high-throughput-computing-with-cp2k'>CP2K</a>, <a href='/apps/lammps/#high-throughput-computing-with-lammps'>LAMMPS</a>, <a href='/apps/amber/#high-throughput-computing-with-amber'>Amber</a>,<br> Python, R \")\n    C -->|No| E(Single- or multi-node subtasks?)\n    E -->|Single| F(Dependencies between subtasks?)\n    E -->|Multi-node| G(<a href='/computing/running/fireworks/'>FireWorks</a>)\n    F -->|Yes| J(<a href='https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/'>Snakemake</a><br><a href='/support/tutorials/nextflow-puhti/'>Nextflow</a><br><a href='/computing/running/fireworks/'>FireWorks</a>)\n    F -->|No| K(<a href='/support/tutorials/many/'>GNU Parallel</a><br><a href='/computing/running/array-jobs/'>Array jobs</a><br><a href='/apps/hyperqueue/'>HyperQueue</a>)\n```\n\nA qualitative overview of the features and capabilities of some of the HTC\ntools recommended by CSC is presented below.\n\n||[Nextflow]|[Snakemake]|[HyperQueue]|[FireWorks]|[Array jobs]|[GNU Parallel]|\n||:------:|:-------:|:--:|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|\n|No excessive IO|![Partial/caveat/uncertain](../../img/alert.svg 'Partial/caveat/uncertain')|![Partial/caveat/uncertain](../../img/alert.svg 'Partial/caveat/uncertain')|![Yes](../../img/check-circle.svg 'Yes')|![Partial/caveat/uncertain](../../img/alert.svg 'Partial/caveat/uncertain')|![Yes](../../img/check-circle.svg 'Yes')|![Yes](../../img/check-circle.svg 'Yes')|\n|Packs jobs/job steps|\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>High-throughput computing involves running a large number of jobs, often enabled by automation, scripts, and workflow managers to save time and reduce errors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A batch job scheduler used in HPC systems that faces problems with a large number of jobs due to excess log data and scheduling overhead)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CP2K<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software with a built-in option for farming-type workloads, suitable for high-throughput computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROMACS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software with a built-in option for farming-type workloads, suitable for high-throughput computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAMMPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software with a built-in option for farming-type workloads, suitable for high-throughput computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An external tool used to pack jobs and job steps for efficient execution in high-throughput computing workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU PARALLEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An external tool used to execute interdependent subtasks as a single batch job in high-throughput computing workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool that allows packing possibly interdependent subtasks to be executed as a single batch job, though it may still create a lot of job steps)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides support and special solutions for workflows containing hundreds or thousands of multi-node subtasks in high-throughput computing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>Slurm is challenged by the characteristics of high-throughput computing due to the large number of jobs and scheduling overhead<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CP2K<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>CP2K is recommended for use in high-throughput computing workflows due to its built-in support for farming-type workloads<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROMACS<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>GROMACS is recommended for use in high-throughput computing workflows due to its built-in support for farming-type workloads<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAMMPS<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>LAMMPS is recommended for use in high-throughput computing workflows due to its built-in support for farming-type workloads<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>HyperQueue is used to enable efficient execution of jobs in high-throughput computing workflows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GNU PARALLEL<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>GNU Parallel is used to execute jobs efficiently in high-throughput computing workflows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>FireWorks allows for the packing of interdependent subtasks in high-throughput computing, despite creating many job steps<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>HIGH-THROUGHPUT COMPUTING<|>CSC Service Desk offers support and solutions for complex high-throughput computing workflows<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
