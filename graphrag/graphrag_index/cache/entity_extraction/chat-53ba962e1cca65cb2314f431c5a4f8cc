The available \ncommand line tools include:\n\n*   a-commmands\n*   allas-backup\n*   rclone\n*   swift\n*   s3cmd\n*   restic\n\n## Using LUMI-O with Allas tools\n\nThe tools provided by [allas-cli-utils](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/) can be used to upload and download data from\nLUMI-O. Running command `allas-conf` in Puhti, Mahti or LUMI starts a normal configuration process for a swift based connection to Allas:\n\n```text\nallas-conf\n```\n\nIf you want to configure connection to LUMI-O instead of Allas you must add option `--lumi` to the command:\n\n```text\nallas-conf --lumi\n```\n\nIf you have allas-cli-utils installed in your local environment, the configuration command would be something like:\n\n```text\nsource allas-cli-utils/allas_conf --lumi\n```\n\nThe configuration process asks you to connect with your browser to LUMI-O configuration sever, create credentials there and then copy the project number and keys for the setup tool. The setup process for LUMI-O will create environment variables needed for _S3_ command and configuration files for `s3cmd` and `rclone`. In addition you can define that `a-commands` will use by default LUMI-O storage server instead of Allas. After that commands like `a-list`, `a-put` or `a-get` will use your LUMI-O storage. If you don't set LUMI-O as the default storage service, you can add option `--lumi` to a-commands to use LUMI-O instead of Allas. \n\nFor `rclone`,  LUMI-O configuration provides two _rclone remotes_: _lumi-o:_ and _lumi-pub:_. The buckets used by _lumi-pub_ will be publicly visible in URL: `https://<project-number>.lumidata.eu/<bucket_name>`.\n\nNote that you can have an active connection to both LUMI-O and Allas at the same time.\n\nFor example, if you would first open Allas connection with command:\n\n```text\nallas-conf\n```\n\nAnd then open LUMI-O connection with:\n\n```text\nallas-conf --lumi\n```\n\n(When running the latter command we accept that LUMI-O will be the default server for a-commands.)\n\nNow you can list the buckets available in LUMI-O with commands:\n\n```text\na-list\n```\n\nor \n\n```text\nrclone lsd lumi-o:\n```\n\nAnd at the same time you can list your buckets in Allas with commands:\n\n```text\na-list --allas\n```\n\nor \n\n```text\nrclone lsd allas:\n```\n\nCopying data from Allas to LUMI-O could now be done with command:\n\n```text\nrclone copyto -P allas:bucket-in-allas/object lumi-o:bucket-in-lumi-o/object\n```\n\nThe command above will work only for files smaller than 5 GB.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
