This client uses\nthe _S3_ protocol that differs from the _Swift_ protocol used in the [Rclone](./rclone.md), [swift](./swift_client.md) and [a-commands](./a_commands.md) examples. Normally data uploaded with S3 can be utilized with swift protocol too. However, over 5 GB files uploaded to Allas with swift can't be downloaded with S3 protocol.\n\nFrom the user perspective, one of the main differences between S3 and Swift protocols is that Swift based connections remain valid for eight hours at a time, but with S3, the connection remains permanently open. The permanent connection is practical in many ways but it has a security aspect: if your CSC account is compromised, so is the object storage space.\n\nThe syntax of the `s3cmd` command:\n```text\ns3cmd -options command parameters\n```\n\nThe most commonly used _s3cmd_ commands:\n\n| s3cmd command | Function |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| mb | Create a bucket |\n| put | Upload an object |\n| ls | List objects and buckets |\n| get | Download objects and buckets |\n| cp | Move object |\n| del | Remove objects or buckets |\n| md5sum | Get the checksum |\n| info | View metadata |\n| signurl | Create a temporary URL |\n| put -P | Make an object public |\n| setacl --acl-grant | Manage access rights |\n\n\nThe table above lists only the most essential _s3cmd_ commands. For more complete list, visit the [s3cmd manual page](https://s3tools.org/usage) or type:\n```text\ns3cmd -h\n```\n## Getting started with s3cmd\n\nIf you use Allas on Puhti or Mahti, all required packages and software are already installed. In this case you can skip this  chapter and proceed to the section [Configuring S3 connection in supercomputers](#configuring-s3-connection-in-supercomputers).\n\nTo configure a s3cmd connection, you need to have _OpenStack_ and _s3cmd_ installed in your environment.\n\n**OpenStack s3cmd installation:**\n\nFedora/RHEL derivatives:\n```text\nsudo yum update\nsudo yum install python3\nsudo pip3 install python-openstackclient\nsudo yum install s3cmd\n```\nDebian derivatives:\n```text\nsudo apt install python3-pip\nsudo pip3 install python-openstackclient\nsudo apt install restic\ncurl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash\nsudo pip3 install s3cmd\n```\nOSX:\n```text\npython3 virtualenv\npip3 install s3cmd\ns3cmd\n```\n\nPlease refer to [http://s3tools.org/download](http://s3tools.org/download) and [http://s3tools.org/usage](http://s3tools.org/usage) for upstream documentation.\n\n** Configuring S3 connection in local computer **\n\nOnce you have _OpenStack_ and _s3cmd_ installed in your environment, you can download the [allas_conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/master/allas_conf)\nscript to set up the S3 connection to your Allas project.\n```text\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/master/allas_conf\nsource allas_conf --mode S3 --user your-csc-username\n```\nNote that you should use the `--user` option to define your CSC username. The configuration command first asks for your\nCSC password and then for you to choose an Allas project. After that, the tool creates a key file for the S3 connection and stores it in the default location (_.s3cfg_ in home directory).\n\n## Configuring S3 connection in supercomputers\n\nTo use _s3cmd_ in Puhti and Mahti, you must first configure the connection:\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf --mode S3\n```\nThe configuration process first asks for your CSC password. Then it lists your Allas projects and asks to select the project to be used. The configuration information is stored in the file _$HOME/.s3cfg_. This configuration only needs to be defined once. In the future, _s3cmd_ will automatically use the object storage connection described in the _.s3cfg_ file. If you wish to change the Allas project that _s3cmd_ uses, you need to run the configuration command again.\n\nYou can use the S3 credentials, stored in the _.s3cfg_ file, in other services too. You can check the currently used _access key_ and _secret_key_ with command:\n```\ngrep key $HOME/.s3cfg\n\n```\n\nIf you use these keys in other services, your should make sure that the keys always remain private. Any person who has access to these two keys, can access and modify all the data that the project has in Allas.\n\nIn needed, you can deactivate an S3 key pair with command:\n\n```\nallas-conf --s3remove\n```\n\n\n\n## Create buckets and upload objects\n\nCreate a new bucket:\n```text\ns3cmd mb s3://my_bucket\n```\n\nUpload a file to a bucket:\n```text\ns3cmd put my_file s3://my_bucket\n```\n\n## List objects and buckets\n\nList all buckets in a project:\n```text\ns3cmd ls\n```\n\nList all objects in a bucket:\n```text\ns3cmd ls s3://my_bucket\n```\n\nDisplay information about a bucket:\n```text\ns3cmd\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>S3CMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>s3cmd is a command line client for uploading, retrieving, and managing data in cloud storage using the S3 protocol)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is an object storage service that uses s3cmd among other tools for data management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWIFT PROTOCOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Swift protocol is used in Rclone, swift client, and a-commands examples for data management, differing from S3 protocol)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides the Allas object storage space and accounts that can be compromised, affecting the security of stored data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenStack supports s3cmd installation and is required for configuring a s3cmd connection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a supercomputer where Allas and required packages for s3cmd are pre-installed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is a supercomputer where Allas and required packages for s3cmd are pre-installed)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3CMD<|>ALLAS<|>s3cmd is used to interact with the Allas object storage service<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC<|>Allas is provided by CSC, and its security can be compromised if a CSC account is<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>S3CMD<|>OpenStack is required for s3cmd installation and configuration<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Allas is accessible on Puhti with s3cmd pre-installed<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Allas is accessible on Mahti with s3cmd pre-installed<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
