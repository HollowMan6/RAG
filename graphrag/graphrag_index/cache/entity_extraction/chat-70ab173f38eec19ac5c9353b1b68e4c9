OpenStack \nAPIs provide access to all OpenStack components and their resources, such \nas nova (compute), glance (VM images), keystone (authentication), swift \n(object storage), cinder (block storage), and neutron (networking). \n\nOpenStack APIs are RESTful and there are multiple ways to interact with \nthem which include using the command-line tools (e.g., `openstack`) or \nusing direct HTTP requests (e.g., with `curl`) or using one of the \nclient libraries (e.g., the `openstacksdk`). \n\nIn this article, we briefly look into using cURL to make direct HTTP requests \nto the OpenStack APIs and move to check how to use the `openstacksdk` to automate \nsome mundane tasks as a demonstration. \n\n### Pouta access through cURL\n\nBefore we can use cURL or any other client to make API requests we need \nto set some environment variables which hold our credentials to Pouta. This \ncan be done by running a script that you can download from the \n[Pouta web interface](https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/) \nafter logging in. See more details from the last section under [Installing the OpenStack tools](install-client.md).\n\nOnce you have the script with your credentials (`<project_name>-openrc.sh`) from \nthe web UI, you can add the environment variables by running the script as:\n\n```bash\nsource <project_name>-openrc.sh\n```\n\nAnd supplying your CSC account username and password when prompted. After this \nYou coud make requests to the Pouta cloud. Normally you would start with \nauthenticating yourself as: \n\n```bash\ncurl -v -s  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -d '\n{\"auth\": {\n    \"identity\": {\n      \"methods\": [\"password\"],\n      \"password\": {\n        \"user\": {\n          \"name\": \"'$OS_USERNAME'\",\n          \"domain\": {\"name\": \"'$OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME'\"},\n          \"password\": \"'$OS_PASSWORD'\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"scope\": {\n      \"project\": {\n        \"domain\": {\"id\": \"'$OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID'\"},\n        \"name\": \"'$OS_PROJECT_NAME'\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}' \"$OS_AUTH_URL/auth/tokens?nocatalog\" | python -m json.tool\n```\n\nAnd obtaining your token as an `X-Subject-Token` response header. The response \nbody for our request will also contain additional useful information which includes \nthe expiration date and time of the token as `\"expires_at\":\"datetime\"`.  \n\nOnce authenticated, we can make further CRUD requests to the various APIs handling our \ncloud resources. For example, we can request the compute API for the list of available \nvirtual machine flavors as:\n\n```\nexport OS_TOKEN=<copy-your-token-here>\nexport OS_COMPUTE_API=https://pouta.csc.fi:8777/v2.1\n```\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -H \"X-Auth-Token: $OS_TOKEN\" \\\n  $OS_COMPUTE_API/flavors \\\n  | python -m json.tool\n```\n\nYou can consult the [Pouta web interface](https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/) further \nto get the right values for the Pouta API endpoints such as `OS_COMPUTE_API`.  \n\n### Pouta access through client libraries\n\n[Openstacksdk](https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/latest/) is a client library (SDK) for \nbuilding applications and services that work with OpenStack Clouds. It provides a consistent and complete \nset of features to interact with the various OpenStack components. The SDK implements Python \nbindings to the OpenStack API, which enables you to perform automation tasks in Python by \nmaking calls on Python objects rather than making REST calls directly.\n\nIn order to use it with our applications we need to first install the SDK as: \n\n```bash\npip install openstacksdk\n```\n\nNext, we need to provide our configurations and credentials through a `clouds.yaml` file which can be downloaded from \nthe [Pouta web interface](https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/) after logging in. \nOpenstacksdk expects this file in one of the following folders: the `current` directory, the `~/.config/openstack` \ndirectory, or `/etc/openstack` directory. The `clouds.yaml` should look like: \n\n```yaml\nclouds:\n  openstack:\n    auth:\n      auth_url: https://pouta.csc.fi:5001/v3\n      username: \"username\"\n      project_id: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n      project_name: \"project_xxxxxx\"\n      user_domain_name: \"Default\"\n    regions:\n    - regionOne\n    interface: \"public\"\n    identity_api_version: 3\n```\n\nYou should add your secrets such as the password field into a separate file \nnamed `secure.yaml` and place it in the same folder as your `clouds.yaml` file. \nThe `secure.yaml` file should look like: \n\n```yaml\nclouds:\n  openstack:\n    auth:\n      password: XXXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nNow, you can run the following simple example which lists the available virtual machine flavors:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport openstack\n\n# Initialize and turn on debug logging\nopenstack.enable_logging(debug=True)\n\n# Initialize cloud\nconn = openstack.connect(cloud='openstack')\n\n# list VM flavors  \nfor flavor in conn.compute.flavors():\n    print(flavor.to_dict())\n``` \n\n### List the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
