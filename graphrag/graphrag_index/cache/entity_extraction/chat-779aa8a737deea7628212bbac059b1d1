Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

A GPU on Puhti/Mahti uses 60 times more billing units than a single CPU core - see above for performance requirements\n    - In practice, 1-10 CPUs (but not more) should be allocated per GPU on Puhti\n    - Note that [LUMI-G](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/compute/lumig/) has a massive GPU capacity available, which is also \"cheaper\" as measured in BUs compared to Puhti/Mahti\n\n# Interactive jobs\n\n- When you login to CSC's supercomputers, you end up on one of the login nodes of the supercomputer\n    - These login nodes are shared by all users and they are [not intended for heavy computing](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/)\n- If you have a heavier job that still requires interaction\n    - Request resources from the [interactive partition](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/) using the `sinteractive` command\n    - This will open an interactive shell where you can perform your computations directly on a compute node instead of the login node\n- Interactive jobs and GUIs can also be launched in the [web interfaces](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/webinterface/)\n    -
