The following levels of `module spider` will then tell you how to\n    find which module(s) to load.\n\n    Note that `module spider` will also search in packages that are hidden from\n    being displayed. These packages can be loaded and used. However, we hide them\n    either because they are not useful to regular users or because we think that\n    they will rarely or never be directly loaded by a user and want to avoid\n    overloading the module display.\n\n 2. `module spider <name of package>` will search for the specific package. This\n    can be the name of a module, but it will also search some other information\n    that can be included in the modules. The search is case-insensitive, e.g.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module spider GNUplot\n    ```\n\n    will show something along the lines of\n\n    ```text\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      gnuplot:\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n        Description:\n          Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing\n          utility\n\n         Versions:\n            gnuplot/5.4.3-cpeAMD-22.08\n            gnuplot/5.4.3-cpeAOCC-21.12\n            gnuplot/5.4.3-cpeAOCC-22.08\n            gnuplot/5.4.3-cpeCray-21.12\n            gnuplot/5.4.3-cpeCray-22.06\n            gnuplot/5.4.3-cpeCray-22.08\n            ...\n    ```\n\n    (abbreviated output) so even though the capitalization of the name was wrong, it can tell us that\n    there are multiple versions of gnuplot. The `cpeAOCC-22.08` and `cpeCray-22.06`\n    tell that the difference is the compiler that was used to install gnuplot,\n    being the AMD AOCC compiler (PrgEnv-aocc) and the Cray compiler (PrgEnv-cray),\n    respectively. This is somewhat important as it is risky to combine modules\n    compiled with different compilers.\n\n    Similarly,\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module spider CMake\n    ```\n\n    returns an output along the lines of\n\n    ```text\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      CMake:\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n         Versions:\n            CMake/3.22.2 (E)\n            CMake/3.23.2 (E)\n            CMake/3.24.0 (E)\n            CMake/3.25.2 (E)\n            CMake/3.27.7 (E)\n\n    Names marked by a trailing (E) are extensions provided by \n    another module.\n    ```\n\n    This tells that there is no `CMake` module on the system but that five\n    versions of `CMake` (3.22.2, 3.23.2, 3.24.0, 3.25.2 and 3.27.7) \n    are available on the system as\n    extensions of another module.\n\n    !!! info \"Information on LUMI software stacks?\"\n        For more information on the software stacks on LUMI, head to the\n        [Software stacks ][softwarestacks] page.\n\n    !!! failure \"Known issue\"\n        We have run into cases where the output of the `module spider` \n        command is incomplete. This is caused\n        by the non-standard way in which the Cray programming environment uses\n        Lmod and also by the way the software stack needs to be installed\n        next to the programming environment rather than integrated with it\n        due to the way the Cray programming environment has to be installed\n        on the system.\n\n    In some cases, if there is no ambiguity, `module spider` will\n    already produce help about the package.\n\n 3. `module spider <module name>/<version>` will show more help information\n    about the package, including information on which other modules need to be\n    loaded to be able to load the package, e.g.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module spider git/2.42.1\n    ```\n\n    will return\n\n    ```text\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      git: git/2.42.1\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n        Description:\n          Git is a free and open source distributed version control\n          system\n\n        You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines \n        below before the \"git/2.42.1\" module is available to load.\n\n          CrayEnv\n          LUMI/23.09  partition/C\n          LUMI/23.09  partition/G\n          LUMI/23.09  partition/L\n    ```\n\n    (abbreviated output). Note that it also tells you which other modules need\n    to be loaded. You need to choose the line which is appropriate for you and\n    load all modules on that line, not the whole list of e.g., 7 modules.\n\n    This form of `module spider` can also be used to find out how a tool provided\n    as an extension by another module can be made available. E.g., in a previous \n    example we've seen that `CMake/3.27.7` is available via another module.\n    Now\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module spider CMake/3.27.7\n    ```\n\n    will return output similar to\n\n    ```text\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      CMake: CMake/3.27.7 (E)\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n        This extension is provided by the following modules.
