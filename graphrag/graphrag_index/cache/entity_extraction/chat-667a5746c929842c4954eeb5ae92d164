Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).\n1. Choose _Profile_ in the navigation menu on the left.\n1. Select and edit the information you wish to change.\n1. Click _Save_.\n\n!!! Note\n\n    You cannot change your username or primary email address. If your email\n    address changes, please contact us at _servicedesk@csc.fi_.\n    \n### When you change your organisation\n\nWhen you are changing your organisation please send us the email address of your new organisation to servicedesk@csc.fi.\nWe will reply and send you the instructions on how to link the new Haka or Virtu-ID with your user account. \n\n\n## How to link your CSC user account to external authentication sources\n\nYou can link your CSC user account to external authentication mechanisms which can be used side by side on several CSC services.\nIn our example we will link CSC user account to MyAccessID but this method is similar to other methods. It's vital that you use the exact same email address you're using in CSC services. This ensures that both services (CSC + MyAccessId) recognize you as the same individual. \n\n### You already have a MyAccessID available\n\n1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi) with your CSC user account.\n1. Choose _Profile_ in the navigation menu on the left.\n1. Select 'MyAccessID' on the 'Login Methods' panel\n1. When asked for confirmation to do the linking, click 'Confirm'\n1. You're now transferred to MyAccessID login page and you must provide your home organization to the search field\n1. When you've selected your home organization you're transferred to your login page and need authenticate\n1. After successful authentication your CSC user account is now linked with MyAccessID\n\n### You do not have a MyAccessID available\n\n1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi) with your CSC user account.\n1. Choose _Profile_ in the navigation menu on the left.\n1. Select 'MyAccessID' on the 'Login Methods' panel\n1. When asked for confirmation to do the linking, click 'Confirm'\n1. Review and accept the information release document\n1. Review and accept the policies for MyAccessID and terms of use for LUMI\n1. You've now registered your MyAccessID. Unfortunately MyAccessID portal does not redirect you back to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi) but you still need to perform the tasks in [You already have a MyAccessID available](../accounts/how-to-manage-user-information.md#you-already-have-a-myaccessid-available)\n\n!!! Note\n\n    If you're invited to a Euro HPC LUMI project or you're a a Euro HPC Project manager you must link your CSC user account with MyAccessID.\n    Otherwise you might end up with 2 separate CSC user accounts.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
