See [updating-size](#updating-size) for how to\n    fix the `NOSIZE` error. The `NOPERM` error requires the owner of the directories\n    to fix the access rights.\n\nBy default, files or empty folders are not shown in the output. Use `--show-all`\nto override this.\n\nUsing `--display-level=<n>` we can show a deeper hierarchy to get more detailed\ninformation.\n\n```bash\n$ lue --display-level=2 /scratch/project_12345/\n\npath, total size, in dir size, % of total, % of dir\n---------------------------------------------------\n/scratch/project_12345/dirA        8.4GB  356KB 100.0 100.0\n    results                            3.7GB  458MB 44.15 44.15\n        simu1                              2.8GB  522MB 32.84 74.38 NOSIZE:1\n        simu2                              521MB  521MB 6.02  13.64 NOSIZE:1\n    installation                       1.4GB  48KB  16.2  16.2 \n        gcc10                              351MB  351MB 4.05  25.02\n        gcc11                              351MB  351MB 4.05  25.02\n        clang15                            351MB  351MB 4.05  25.02\n        intel                              350MB  350MB 4.04  24.94\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can just run the tool on one of the sub-folders to get a smaller,\nless cluttered output.\n\n```bash\n$ lue /scratch/project_12345/dirA/result\n\npath, total size, in dir size, % of total, % of dir\n---------------------------------------------------\n/scratch/project_12345/dirA/result           3.7GB  458MB 100.0 100.0\n    simu1                                        2.8GB  522MB 74.38 74.38 NOSIZE:1\n    simu2                                        521MB  521MB 13.64 13.64 NOSIZE:1\n```\n\nLUE keeps a very simple cache of runs. After running LUE on `/scratch/project_12345/dirA/`\nyou can run it on any subdirectories without actually re-querying anything from the file system.\nTo force the tool to refresh the data (for example if a run needs other options or the cache\nis to old), use `--refresh`. The cache is saved under `$TMPDIR`, so if you switch nodes, you\nwill need to rerun.\n\nUsing the `--yaml file.yaml` and `--json file.json` options you can save the output\nin a more parsable format instead of printing it to the screen.\n\n## Updating size\n\nAs mentioned, files which have not been accessed since _2020-11-18_ are not reported\ncorrectly. Note that this applies only for **Puhti**, Mahti does not have this limitation.\n\nNext follows the steps to correct this. This procedure needs to be done only once,\nafter which the size should be reported correctly:\n\n1. Run `lue <target_dir>`.\n      - If no warnings are printed and there are no `NOSIZE` labels, the reported size\n        should be fairly accurate. No need for further steps.\n2. Rerun `lue --sync-size <target_dir>`. The previous command should have reported\n   the number of affected files and a (very) rough estimate of the duration.\n      - A progress bar will be updated to show how many files have been processed and\n        how many files could not be updated due to insufficient permissions.\n3. Rerun `lue --refresh <target_dir>`.\n      - Shown size should be fairly accurate.\n\n**If there are still `NOSIZE` labels reported:**\n\n1. Some files could not be updated due to insufficient permissions.\n      - The number of affected files was reported when running with `--sync-size`.\n         - If the number matches the number of `NOSIZE`, there is no need for steps 2. and 3.\n      - Can only be remedied by the owner fixing the access permissions.\n      - If the number of affected files is small (<1000), you can rerun with\n        `lue --refresh <target_dir> --stat-unsynced` to get more accurate size info,\n        although this will be a bit slower.\n2. Some files require much heavier operations to sync the size.\n      - Rerun with `lue --sync-size --slow-sync <target_dir>`. **NOTE!** Adding the\n        `--slow-sync` option will be about x10 slower than with just `--sync-size`\n      - Before doing this run `lue` on some of the sub-folders (without `--refresh`)\n        to find out where the `NOSISZE` files are located. Then use `ls -l` or `du -h`\n        to confirm that the files are actually not zero in size. If the files seem to\n        be non-zero in size, run with `--slow-sync`. Otherwise go to 3.\n      - Usually this step is not needed.\n3. Some files are very old and have an actual size of zero -> we have incorrectly\n   flagged them.\n      - If you know that you\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
