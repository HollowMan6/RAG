The service is based on a European network of local repositories. CSC hosts Finnish FEGA. Please note that this user guide is specific for Finnish FEGA service.\n\nYou can use FEGA either to submit, apply or approve access to biomedical datasets. The service allows you to store sensitive research data under controlled access in Finland. At the same time, the public study information (metadata) is made internationally available in central [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/studies) (EGA). Each dataset is associated with a Data Access Committee (DAC), which evaluates data access applications and can grant or deny data access for re-use. If the application is approved, the applicant can directly access and analyse the sensitive data in a secure and private cloud workspace using CSC Sensitive Data Services for research. FEGA requires a separate contract. Choose the correct user guide below:\n\n## I want to ...\n\n### [... access data.](./fega-application.md)\n### [... approve data access.](./fega-dac.md)\n### [... submit data.](./fega-submission.md)\n\n<br/>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zsZe4ZEld0M\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n## Useful terminology\n\n- **Central EGA**. Central European Genome-phenome Archive. When submitting data to FEGA, the metadata is made internationally available in central EGA. \n\n- **Data Access Committee (DAC)**. Individual or group of individuals who are controllers for a dataset stored at FEGA and are responsible for approving and rejecting access requests to that dataset.\n\n- **Data Applicant**. Individual who applies access to sensitive data or metadata that has been stored at FEGA.\n\n- **Data Submitter**. Individual who uploads data, metadata, and other information to FEGA for re-use under controlled access. The data submitter represents data owner organisation during the submission process.\n\n- **Finnish FEGA**. A national repository for biomedical data consented for research. CSC hosts Finnish FEGA. The research data uploaded to Finnish FEGA will remain under controlled access in Finland.\n\n!!! note\n    For more information, check Federated EGA [service description](https://research.csc.fi/-/fega) in CSC service catalog and [CSC sensitive Data Services for research webpage](https://research.csc.fi/sensitive-data-services-for-research).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FEDERATED EUROPEAN GENOME-PHENOME ARCHIVE (FEGA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FEGA is a service for storing and publishing human genetic and phenotypic data consented for research, based on a European network of local repositories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC hosts Finnish FEGA, providing a national repository for biomedical data consented for research in Finland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL EUROPEAN GENOME-PHENOME ARCHIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Central EGA is where metadata submitted to FEGA is made internationally available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A committee responsible for approving or rejecting access requests to datasets stored at FEGA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA APPLICANT<|>PERSON<|>Individual applying for access to sensitive data or metadata stored at FEGA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA SUBMITTER<|>PERSON<|>Individual who uploads data, metadata, and other information to FEGA for re-use under controlled access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A national repository hosted by CSC for biomedical data consented for research, ensuring data remains under controlled access in Finland)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEDERATED EUROPEAN GENOME-PHENOME ARCHIVE (FEGA)<|>CSC<|>CSC hosts the Finnish segment of FEGA, providing infrastructure and services<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEDERATED EUROPEAN GENOME-PHENOME ARCHIVE (FEGA)<|>CENTRAL EUROPEAN GENOME-PHENOME ARCHIVE<|>FEGA contributes metadata to Central EGA, making it internationally available<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>FEDERATED EUROPEAN GENOME-PHENOME ARCHIVE (FEGA)<|>DAC evaluates and approves data access applications for datasets stored at FEGA<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA APPLICANT<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>Data Applicants submit access requests to DAC for evaluation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA SUBMITTER<|>FEDERATED EUROPEAN GENOME-PHENOME ARCHIVE (FEGA)<|>Data Submitters upload data to FEGA for controlled access re-use<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>CSC<|>CSC hosts Finnish FEGA, ensuring it remains a secure repository for Finnish biomedical data<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
