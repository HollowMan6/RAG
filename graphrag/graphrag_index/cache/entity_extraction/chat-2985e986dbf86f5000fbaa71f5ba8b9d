This is called Source to Image or `s2i`. It is used by running `oc new-app URL#branch`, the `#branch` is optional. For example, use the official python sample code:\n\n```bash\n$ oc new-app https://github.com/CSCfi/nodejs-16-rahti-example.git\n--> Found Docker image 9d200cd (7 weeks old) from Docker Hub for \"node:16.15.0\"\n\n    * An image stream tag will be created as \"node:16.15.0\" that will track the source image\n    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/CSCfi/nodejs-16-rahti-example.git will be created\n      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag \"nodejs-16-rahti-example:latest\"\n      * Every time \"node:16.15.0\" changes a new build will be triggered\n    * This image will be deployed in deployment config \"nodejs-16-rahti-example\"\n    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service \"nodejs-16-rahti-example\"\n      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname \"nodejs-16-rahti-example\"\n    * WARNING: Image \"node:16.15.0\" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator\n\n--> Creating resources ...\n    imagestream.image.openshift.io \"node\" created\n    imagestream.image.openshift.io \"nodejs-16-rahti-example\" created\n    buildconfig.build.openshift.io \"nodejs-16-rahti-example\" created\n    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io \"nodejs-16-rahti-example\" created\n    service \"nodejs-16-rahti-example\" created\n--> Success\n    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/nodejs-16-rahti-example' to track its progress.\n    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:\n     'oc expose svc/nodejs-16-rahti-example' \n    Run 'oc status' to view your app.\n```\n\nThen do as suggested and expose the new application to the outside world:\n\n```bash\n$ oc expose svc/nodejs-16-rahti-example\nroute.route.openshift.io/nodejs-16-rahti-example exposed\n```\n\nIn order to get the new route hostname do:\n\n```bash\noc get route nodejs-16-rahti-example\n```\n\nIf you enter the hostname in a browser, you will see the \"Hello World!\" message.\n\nA new build can be triggered in the command line:\n\n```bash\noc start-build nodejs-16-rahti-example\n```\n\nOr using [webhooks](../../tutorials/webhooks.md)\n\n### Using the inline Dockerfile method\n\nIt is possible to create a new build using a Dockerfile provided in the command line. By doing this, the `Dockerfile` itself will be embedded in the Build object, so there is no need for an external Git repository.\n\n```bash\noc new-build -D $'FROM centos:7'\n```\n\nIn this example, we will build an image that is a copy of `CentOS 7`.\n\nIt is also possible to create a build from a given `Dockerfile`:\n\n```bash\ncat Dockerfile | oc new-build -D -\n```\n\n### Import from Git (Private Repositories) using the Web GUI\n\nDeploying a private Git repository to Rahti involves setting up the necessary authentication to access your private repository. Without proper authentication, you will see the error \"URL is valid but cannot be reached\" (seen in the pictures below). Here's how to resolve this using two authentication methods:\n\n\n![oie_1671443U3OLpFT1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a844e224-769e-4d9f-bba2-043ad5c9b258)\n\n\n#### Option 1: Using a Token for Git Authentication\n\n1. **Generate a Personal Access Token:**\n\n    - **GitHub:**\n         - Go to your GitHub account settings.\n         - Navigate to \"Developer settings\" > \"Personal access tokens\".\n         - Click on \"Generate new token\".\n         - Select the scopes you need (typically, you'll need `repo` scope for private repositories).\n         - Generate the token and copy it.\n\n    - **GitLab:**\n         - Go to your GitLab profile settings.\n         - Navigate to \"Access Tokens\".\n         - Give your token a name, select the required scopes (e.g., `api`, `read_repository`), and create the token.\n         - Copy the token.\n\n3. **Add the Token to Rahti:**\n    - Under \"Source Secret\" choose \"Create new Secret\"\n    - Name the secret, under \"Authentication type\" choose \"Basic Authentication\"\n    - Paste the token and create\n\n![oie_1672121lETtYQ6J](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bd9450f-170b\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
