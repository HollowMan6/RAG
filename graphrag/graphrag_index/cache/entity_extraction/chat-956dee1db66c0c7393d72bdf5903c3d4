Consider also whether you really need speed or just a lot of\n    sampling. Accelerated sampling can also be achieved through ensemble\n    simulations, where multiple independent trajectories (e.g. the same system\n    equilibrated from different initial velocities) are run at the same time.\n    For more details, see the section on\n    [high-throughput simulations with Amber](#high-throughput-computing-with-amber).\n\n    If you want to use more than one GPU, perform scaling tests to verify that\n    the jobs really become faster and use a binary with `.cuda.MPI` or\n    `.hip.MPI` extension. The rule of thumb is that when you double the\n    resources, the job duration should decrease at least 1.5-fold. For overall\n    performance info, consult the\n    [Amber benchmark scaling details](http://ambermd.org/GPUPerformance.php).\n    Typically, the best efficiency is achieved with 1 GPU.\n\n### Example GPU batch scripts for LUMI\n\nAmber can be loaded into use on LUMI with:\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule load amber/24-gpu\n# or\nmodule load amber/24-cpu\n```\n\n=== \"1 GCD (half a GPU)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --partition=small-g\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n    #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1\n    #SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n    module load amber/24-gpu\n\n    srun pmemd.hip -O -i mdin.GPU -o mdout.GPU -p Cellulose.prmtop -c Cellulose.inpcrd\n    ```\n\n=== \"8 GCDs (4 GPUs)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --partition=standard-g\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8\n    #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8\n    #SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n    module load amber/24-gpu\n\n    export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1\n\n    cat << EOF > select_gpu\n    #!/bin/bash\n\n    export ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\\$SLURM_LOCALID\n    exec \\$*\n    EOF\n\n    chmod +x ./select_gpu\n\n    CPU_BIND=\"mask_cpu:fe000000000000,fe00000000000000\"\n    CPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe0000,fe000000\"\n    CPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe,fe00\"\n    CPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe00000000,fe0000000000\"\n\n    srun --cpu-bind=$CPU_BIND ./select_gpu pmemd.hip.MPI -O -i mdin.GPU -o mdout.GPU -p Cellulose.prmtop -c Cellulose.inpcrd\n    ```\n\nA performance comparison of Amber on CPUs (Mahti) and GPUs (Puhti, Mahti, LUMI)\nis shown in the bar plot below. Notice how the performance of a single GPU on\nall systems is an order of magnitude better than a full Mahti CPU node (128\ncores). Note also that Amber is typically not able to scale efficiently to\nmultiple GPUs unless you have a very large system (>1 million particles).\n\n![Amber scaling on GPUs and CPUs on Puhti, Mahti and LUMI](../img/cellulose-amber.png 'Amber scaling on GPUs and CPUs on Puhti, Mahti and LUMI')\n\n!!! info \"GPU binding on LUMI\"\n    Running on multiple GPUs on LUMI will benefit from GPU binding. In the\n    example above, a bitmask is used to bind CPU cores to optimal (linked) GPUs\n    as well as exclude the first CPU core in each group of 8 cores (these are\n    reserved for the operating system and thus not available for computing).\n    For background and further instructions, see the\n    [LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/distribution-binding/).\n    Note that CPU/GPU binding is only possible when reserving full nodes\n    (`standard-g` or `--exclusive`).\n\nGeneric batch script examples for\n[LUMI-G](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumig-job/)\nand\n[LUMI-C](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumic-job/)\nare available in the LUMI documentation.\n\n### Interactive jobs\n\nSometimes it is more convenient to run small jobs, like system preparations,\ninteractively. Interactive batch jobs prevent excessive load on the login node\nand should be used in these kinds of cases. You can request a shell on a\ncompute node from the\n[Puhti/Mahti web interface](../computing/webinterface/index.md), from the\ncommand line with\n[sinteractive](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md), or manually with:\n\n```bash\nsrun -n 1 -p test -t 00:05:00 --account=<project> --pty /bin/bash\n```\n\nOnce you have been allocated resources (you might need to wait), you can run\ne.g. the `paramfit` task directly with:\n\n```bash\nparamfit -i Job\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
