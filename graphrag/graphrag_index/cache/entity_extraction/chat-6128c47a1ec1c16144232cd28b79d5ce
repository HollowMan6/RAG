It is part of our [Machine\nlearning guide](ml-guide.md).\n\nFirst we will explain the general principles, such as single- and\nmulti-node jobs and mechanisms for launching multiple processes. After\nthat we discuss some common software frameworks how to use them on\nCSC's supercomputers: [PyTorch DDP](#pytorch-ddp),\n[DeepSpeed](#deepspeed) and briefly [Horovod](#horovod) and\n[TensorFlow's\n`tf.distribute.Strategy`](#tensorflows-tfdistributestrategy).\n\n## Nodes and tasks\n\n### GPU Nodes\n\nEach separate GPU node (i.e., a single computer in the cluster), has a\nfixed number of GPUs. Puhti and Mahti have 4 GPUs per node, and LUMI\nhas 8 GPUs per node.  (Technically a LUMI node has 4 GPUs cards, but 8\nGPU dies.) The entire supercomputer may have tens or even thousands of\nGPU nodes. See [GPU-accelerated machine learning](gpu-ml.md) for more\ndetails, in particular the table describing the different GPUs in\nCSC's various supercomputers might be of interest.\n\nIf you need 1-4 GPUs (or 1-8 in LUMI) you should always reserve a\n**single node job**. If you need more than 4 GPUs (or 8 in LUMI) you\nneed to reserve a **multi-node job**. While it is technically possible\nto reserve, e.g., two GPUs in one node and two in another, this is not\nrecommended except for testing purposes, as the communication across\nnodes is always slower than inside a node.\n\n\n### MPI tasks\n\nWhen parallelizing to multiple GPUs it is common to allocate a\nseparate CPU process for handling the communication to each GPU. This\nper GPU task division may be handled by the program itself, for\nexample using [Python's multiprocessing\nlibrary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) to\nlaunch separate processes. Another method is to use Slurm's MPI\nfacility to launch **multiple MPI tasks**. Whether MPI tasks are used\nor not often depends on the software framework used.\n\n### Slurm examples\n\nIn this section we provide Slurm batch script examples for launching\nsingle- or multi-node jobs, with or without MPI.\n\n!!! warning \"Note\"\n    \n    Please make sure that your code can actually take advantage of multiple GPUs as\n    this typically requires some changes to the program. **Simply reserving more GPUs\n    is not enough!**\n    \nYou can [monitor that your program is using all the reserved\nGPUs](gpu-ml.md#gpu-utilization) with the same mechanisms described in\nour GPU-accelerated machine learning guide. The only difference is\nthat you should now see statistics for more than one GPU.\n\n\n#### Single node run using 2 GPUs, no MPI\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpu\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=20\n    #SBATCH --mem=160G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:2\n        \n    srun python3 myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpusmall\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=64\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:2\n    \n    srun python3 myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n    \n    Note that on Mahti, the maximum for the `gpusmall` partition is 2\n    GPUs. For 3 or 4 GPUs or more you need to use the `gpumedium`\n    partition.\n\n=== \"LUMI\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=small-g\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=14\n    #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=2\n    #SBATCH --mem=120G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    \n    srun python3 myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n\nThe example above can be easily changed to more than 2 GPUs by\nchanging the number specified in the `--gres` option (Puhti and Mahti)\nor `--gpus-per-node` option (LUMI). The maximum for a single node job\nis 4 GPUs (Puhti and Mahti) or 8 GPUs (LUMI). \n\nIf you increase the number of GPUs you may also wish to increase the\nnumber of CPU cores and the amount of memory reserved. In our\nexamples, we have used **as a rule of thumb to reserve CPU cores and\nmemory in the same proportion as the number of GPUs**. \n\nFor example in Puhti there are 4 GPUs, 40 CPU cores, and 384 GBs of\nmemory per node. For each GPU we would then reserve 10 CPU cores, and\nroughly 95G of memory (for memory we round down a bit as the units are\nnot so exact). \n\nOn [LUMI use a maximum of 7 CPU cores and 60GB per\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
