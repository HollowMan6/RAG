It produces cartographic products, including digital terrain models (DTMs), ortho-projected images, 3D models, and bundle-adjusted networks of cameras. ASPâ€™s data products are suitable for science analysis, mission planning, and public outreach. \n\n## Usage\n\nAmes Stereo Pipeline is included in the following module:\n\n* ames-stereo: 3.2.0\n\nLoad the module:\n\n```\nmodule load ames-stereo\n```\n\nYou can test that Ames Stereo Pipeline is loaded successfully with\n\n```\nstereo -help\n```\n\nRunning `parallel_stereo` can be very computationally expensive, so it should be run via batch job system. The software developers recommend reserving full nodes for Ames Stereo Pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n### Example batch job\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --output=asp.log\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=40\n#SBATCH --mem=50G\n#SBATCH --time=5:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --account=project_200XXXX\n\nmodule load ames-stereo\n\nparallel_stereo [options] <images> [<cameras>] <output_file_prefix>\n```\n\nThe [parallel_stereo](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/parallel_stereo.html) program is the primary tool of the Ames Stereo Pipeline, it has a lot of different options described in detail in documentation.\n\nAmes Stereo Pipeline supports also multi-node batch jobs, see its [PBS and SLURM documentation](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#using-pbs-and-slurm) for details; please notice that in Puhti, in addition to the mentioned arguments, you need to provide the `--account` argument and use the correct [`--partion`-names](../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md).\n\n\n## License \n\nNASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) is distributed under [Apache-2 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\n## Citation\n\n[Citing the Ames Stereo Pipeline in your work](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#citing-the-ames-stereo-pipeline-in-your-work). \n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nPlease acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.
