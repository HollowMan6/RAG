packages\n\nOver the past decade, the [Python programming language][python] and [Scientific\nPython][scientific-python] packages like NumPy, SciPy, JAX, and PyTorch have\ngained a lot of popularity in the data science and HPC communities.\n\nWe do support using Scientific Python packages on LUMI.\nHowever, care must be taken to *install* such packages in a way that *plays well with LUMI*.\n\n!!! warning \"Please don't install Python packages directly\"\n    To to provide the best user experience, it is **strongly discouraged**\n    to install Python packages directly to the user home folder,\n    `/scratch`, `/project`, etc. using [Conda][conda], [pip][pip], or similar\n    package management tools. Please read this page carefully for better\n    alternatives.\n\nA Python installation usually consists of the Python interpreter, the Python\nstandard library and one or more third party Python packages. Such Python\npackages may include both compiled code and a lot of so-called Python modules,\ni.e. a lot of small files containing Python code. A typical\n[Conda][conda] environment tends to contain tens to hundreds of thousands of\nrelatively small files.\n\nInstalling such a large number of small files to the user home folder or shared\nlocations like `/scratch`, `/project`, or even `/flash`, and trying to load\nthem from multiple processes at the same time, puts a lot of strain on the\n[Lustre file system][lustre] serving these storage locations. Lustre simply\nisn't designed for such use cases. Thus, to maintain good file system\nperformance for all users (it is a shared file system), care must be taken when\ninstalling Python packages on LUMI.\n\n**Which installation method should I use then?**\n\nThe best way to get access to a Python installation on LUMI depends on the use\ncase. Below, we provide an overview of recommended ways to get access to Python\ninstallations on LUMI.\n\n!!! warning \"The default Python is the OS Python\"\n    When you log into LUMI, running `python3` without loading a module or using\n    a container will result in using the operating system Python installation.\n    This is quite an old Python installation (version 3.6) without any Scientific\n    Python packages, which is likely not what you want.\n\n## Generally recommended installation methods\n\nIn general, we recommend using [Singularity/Apptainer\ncontainers][singularity-containers] for managing Python installations. Using a container solves the \"many\nsmall files\" performance problem and makes it easy to manage multiple different\nPython environments at the same time. To use a container, you may either [use an existing\ncontainer](#use-an-existing-container) or [build a container tailored to your\nneeds](#use-a-container-you-build-specifically-tailored-to-your-needs).\n\n### Use an existing container\n\nIf somebody is already publishing a container which includes the Python\npackages you need, e.g. this [PyTorch ROCm\ncontainer](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch), you may [pull and use that\ncontainer][pull-container].\n\n### Use a container you build specifically tailored to your needs\n\nIf you are not able to find an existing container that suits your needs, you\nmay [build your own][singularity-build]. If you are used to managing\n[Conda][conda]/[pip][pip] environments locally, you may use [cotainr] to build\na container based on a [Conda environment][conda-env] file for use on LUMI.\n\n## Installation methods recommended for specific use cases\n\nFor certain use cases, there may be better and/or easier alternatives to using\na container:\n\n- If you only need **very few** (less than 5, including dependencies) extra\nPython packages, you may [use the pre-installed\ncray-python](#use-the-cray-python-module) or [install a pip environment for use\nwith a container](#use-an-existing-container-with-a-pip-virtual-environment).\n- If your workflow relies on a fixed environment in which you run a single\nbinary/script and/or need intertwining with the host software environment, you\nmay [wrap it using the LUMI container wrapper](#use-the-lumi-container-wrapper).\n- If you are used to the managed software stacks on the CSC HPC systems, you may\nprefer to [use pre-installed Python packages in the CSC software\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python is a popular programming language used in data science and HPC communities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENTIFIC PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scientific Python encompasses packages like NumPy, SciPy, JAX, and PyTorch for scientific computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a computing environment that supports Scientific Python packages with specific installation recommendations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Conda is a package management tool used for installing Python packages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lustre is a type of file system that serves storage locations but is not designed for handling many small files from Python packages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGULARITY/APPTAINER CONTAINERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Containers provide a solution for managing Python installations and avoiding performance issues with many small files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH ROCM CONTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific container that includes Python packages for PyTorch with ROCm support)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COTAINR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for building containers based on Conda environment files for use on LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY-PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-installed Python module on LUMI for basic Python package needs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>SCIENTIFIC PYTHON<|>Scientific Python packages are built on the Python programming language<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>CONDA<|>LUMI provides specific recommendations for installing Python packages with Conda<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>PIP<|>LUMI provides specific recommendations for installing Python packages with Pip<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUSTRE<|>LUMI's storage is served by Lustre, which impacts how Python packages should be installed<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>SINGULARITY/APPTAINER CONTAINERS<|>LUMI recommends using Singularity/Apptainer containers for Python installations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDA<|>COTAINR<|>Cotainr is used to build containers based on Conda environments for LUMI<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIP<|>CRAY-PYTHON<|>Cray-Python on LUMI may be used in conjunction with Pip for installing a few Python packages<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
