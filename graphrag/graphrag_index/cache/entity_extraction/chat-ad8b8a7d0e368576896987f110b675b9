This means that\nyou are likely less affected by maintenance.\n\nThese flavors are not suitable for computationally intensive\nworkloads. The virtual CPUs used in these instances are\novercommitted, which means 32 hyperthreaded CPU cores are used to\nprovide more than 32 virtual cores.\n\n**Flavor characteristics:**\n\n-   Redundant power\n-   CPU: Varies\n-   Network: Redundant 25 Gb/s\n-   Flavor disk: Stored in the central storage\n-   Single-node or disk failures may cause downtime, but instances\n    are recoverable.\n\n### **HPC flavors**\n\nTypical use cases:\n\n-   Scientific applications\n\nIf your use case is computationally intensive, you should use one of\nthe HPC flavors. The availability of these instances is not as high\nas the standard flavors, but you get better performance.
