For\nexample `zgrep` or `bzgrep` can be used to search rows from files\ncompressed with `gzip` or `bzip2`.\n\n## Using `sed` to select rows by row number\n\nThe stream editor `sed` can be used to select and modify rows\nin a text file. Many of the `grep` operations described above can be done\nwith `sed` too. The `sed` command is discussed in more detail in the chapter\n[Replacing characters and strings](#replacing-words-and-strings-with-sed).\nHere we only show how `sed` can be used to select a certain row from a file.\nFor example the third row of the file `authors.txt` could be selected with\ncommand `sed -n \"3\"p authors.txt` In this case the result is\n`Pekka Niemi. Tampere 26`. This row-picking method is handy in loops. For\nexample, the following loop would print out three rows from the example file:\n\n```bash\nfor i in 4 3 2\ndo\n  row=$(sed -n \"$i\"p authors.txt)\n  echo \"Row $i looks like: $row\"\ndone\n```\n\n## Simple column selection with `cut`\n\nThe `cut` command provides a simple tool to select\ncharacter *regions* (`-c`) or *columns* (`-f`) from a Linux text\nfile. When selecting by character numbers, the syntax of the command is:\n\n```bash\ncut -cstart-end\n```\n\nFor example, the command\n\n```bash\ncut -c2-5 authors.txt\n```\n\nprints text from the second to the fifth character from each row of the\n`authors.txt` file. Assuming this is the same file that was used in the\n`grep` examples above, the output looks like:\n\n```text\neva\narku\nekka\neena\n```\n\nWith option `-f`, columns can be printed. By default, *Tabulator* is\nused as the column delimiter. Other delimiters can be defined with the\noption `-d`. For example, to select the first and third column\n(`-f1,3`) from the file `authors.txt`, we need to define *Space* as the\ndelimiter (`-d \" \"`):\n\n```bash\n$ cut -d \" \" -f1,3 authors.txt\nEeva Oulu\nMarkus Turku\nPekka Tampere\nLeena Kuopio\n```\n\n## Using `awk` to work with columns\n\n`awk` is a scripting language that can be used to process text\nfiles in Linux environments. `awk` is a rather old programming language,\nand nowadays more modern scripting tools are normally used for creating\ndata management scripts. However, due to very simple syntax, `awk` is\nstill frequently used to perform simple filtering and editing tasks. In\nthis guide we don't provide a general overview of `awk` programming.\nInstead, we show some examples how `awk` can be used to work with files\nor as a part of Linux command pipelines. In the simple command-line\nusage, the basic syntax of `awk` is:\n\n```bash\nawk -F \"field delimiter\" 'statement {command1}{command2}...' infile.dat\n```\n\n`awk` can be used to process the input data as columns. By default, `awk`\nuses both *Space* and *Tab* characters as column delimiters (note that unlike\nthe `cut` command, `awk` interprets all successive spaces as one single column\nseparator). The columns can be accessed in `awk` with variables named `$1`\n(the first column), `$2` (second column), `$3` (third column) etc. `$0`\ncan be used to refer to \"all columns\". For example, the following\ncommand prints the first and third column of the file `authors.txt`.\n\n```bash\n$ awk '{print $1 $3}' authors.txt\nEevaOulu\nMarkusTurku\nPekkaTampere\nLeenaKuopio\n```\n\nIn the example above, the fields are not separated in the output. To do\nthat, you need to add the space or tabulator character (`\\t`) to the print\nstatement. You can also add other text to the output. Then next example\nadds text and changes the order of columns:\n\n```bash\n$ awk '{print \"Location: \"$3\"\\t Name: \"$1\" \"$2}' authors.txt\nLocation: Oulu   Name: Eeva Pekkanen.\nLocation: Turku  Name: Markus Aho.\nLocation: Tampere   Name: Pekka Niemi.\nLocation: Kuopio    Name: Leena Virtanen.\n```\n\nA more sophisticated way to do the modification above is to use the\n`printf` command instead of `print`. The syntax of the `awk printf`\ncommand is similar to that of the Linux command `printf`.\n\n```bash\nawk '{printf \"Location:%s\\tName: %s %s \\n\", $3, $1, $2}' authors.txt\n```\n\nOne of the nice features of `awk` is that you can use conditional\nstatements in the command. You can compare both strings and numbers. For\nexample, the following command prints data only when the third column is\n\"Tampere\":\n\n```bash\n$ awk '{if ( $3 == \"Tampere\")  print \"Location: \"$3\"\\tName: \"$1\" \"$2}' authors.txt\nLocation: Tampere       Name: Pekka Niemi.\n```\n\nAlternatively, the condition could be defined in the statement part\nbefore the `awk` commands\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
