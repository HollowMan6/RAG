If the network is not configured properly, the public key may not be added and no access will be configured.\n\n### REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED\n\nSometimes Floating IPs are reused with different Virtual Machines at different times. By default SSH will have `stricthostkeychecking=yes` configured, and will show you the error message:\n\n```sh\n$ ssh cloud-user@86.50.xxx.xxx\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nIT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!\nSomeone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!\nIt is also possible that a host key has just been changed.\nThe fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is\nSHA256:JURkzITHXHGavwz6fAahou5g4ii1q9CVuzLyImH5+tI.\nPlease contact your system administrator.\nAdd correct host key in /home/yyyy/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.\nOffending ECDSA key in /home/yyyy/.ssh/known_hosts:28\n  remove with:\n  ssh-keygen -f \"/home/yyyy/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R \"86.50.xxx.xxx\"\nECDSA host key for 86.50.xxx.xxx has changed and you have requested strict checking.\nHost key verification failed.\n```\n\nYou can safely do as it suggests and remove the entry. But only if you are **sure** that it is the first time you connect to said IP since it has been **assigned to a new instance**, or since the instance has been **reinstalled**.\n\n## `root` administrator access on a virtual machine\n\nIf you are using an image provided by Pouta, and logged in using the default user account, you will be able to run commands as root with `sudo` with no password. If other accounts are created, they will not have `root` administrator access by default.\n\n```sh\nsudo <some command>\n```\n\nYou can also get an interactive root shell:\n\n```sh\nsudo -i\n```\n\n## Connect to a machine using the Pouta virtual console\n\nIt is possible to access a machine using the Pouta Virtual console. This is only advisable **when SSH access is impossible**, for example when the network access of the Virtual Machine is broken.\n\nIn order to be able to use the console, **you need to set up a password-based user account first**:\n\n* Connected through SSH to your Virtual Machine instance\n* You can use [useradd](https://linux.die.net/man/8/useradd) and or [passwd](https://linux.die.net/man/1/passwd) to set up the account.\n* As indicated in our [security guidelines](security.md#be-mindful-about-the-user-accounts-in-the-vm), please **do not enable remote login** for this **password-based account**, but rather use it only in case you need to access the instance though the console.\n\nOnce there is a password based account, with no remote login allowed:\n\n* From the instance page at **Compute > Instances**, open a console session by clicking **Console** in the instance dropdown menu:\n\n![Open a console in the web GUI](../../img/console-button-horizon.png)\n\n* To input text in the console, click the grey bar:\n\n![Input text to web console](../../img/pouta-instances-terminal.png)\n\n* Log in with the user account and password you have created.\n\n!!! warning \"Non ASCII characters problems\"\n    *Umlaut* characters, such as *ä* or *ö*, do not work in the virtual\n    console for most keymaps.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
