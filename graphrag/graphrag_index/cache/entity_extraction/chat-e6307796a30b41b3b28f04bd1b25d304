Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n \n4.

Then use `ls -l` or `du -h`\n        to confirm that the files are actually not zero in size. If the files seem to\n        be non-zero in size, run with `--slow-sync`. Otherwise go to 3.\n      - Usually this step is not needed.\n3. Some files are very old and have an actual size of zero -> we have incorrectly\n   flagged them.\n      - If you know that you have a program/framework which produces a lot of empty\n        files, consider removing those before running the tool.\n      - If you already ran with `--slow-sync` or confirmed that it was not needed, you\n        can add the `--no-guess` flag to not report these files.\n\n## Limiting the runtime\n\nIt's a good idea to limit the runtime of the tool, and often we get useful information\neven though we did not go through the folder structure exhaustively. If you press\n`Ctrl-C` to interrupt the tool, the processed information will be saved and you can\nrerun without `--refresh` to view the results. Other options to limit the runtime are:\n\n`--timeout <n>`\n\n: Stop after `<n>` minutes (default 30min if `--timeout` is not set)\n\n`--file-limit <n>`\n\n: Stop the search after going through a set amount of files.\n\n`--size-limit <n>`\n\n: Stop the search after reaching a set total size. Supported units are K, M, G, T.\n  If no suffix is used G is assumed.\n\n`--search-depth <n>`\n\n: Limit search depth to `<n>`. Default is no limit.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
