You can run multiple workflow tasks (i.e., rules) concurrently by submitting\n   more jobs using the `snakemake` command as:\n\n   ```bash\n   snakemake -s Snakefile --jobs 8 --use-singularity --executor cluster-generic --cluster-generic-submit-cmd \"hq submit --cpus 5\"\n   ``` \n\n2. Replace the above modification in the `snakemake_hq_puhti.sh` batch script\n   (and use your own project number) before submitting the Snakemake workflow\n   job with:\n\n   ```\n   sbatch snakemake_hq_puhti.sh\n   ```\n\n‚òùüèª Note that just increasing the value of `--jobs` will not automatically make\nall those jobs run at the same time. This option of the `snakemake` command is\njust a maximum limit for the number of concurrent jobs. Jobs will eventually\nrun when resources are available. In this case, we run 8 concurrent jobs, each\nusing 5 CPU cores to match the reserved 40 CPU cores (one Puhti node) in the\nbatch script. In practice, it is also a good idea to dedicate a few cores for\nthe workflow manager itself.\n\nüí° It is also possible to use more than one node to achieve even higher\nthroughput as HyperQueue can make use of multi-node resource allocations.\nJust remember that with HyperQueue the workflow tasks themselves should be\nsub-node (use one node at most) as MPI tasks are poorly supported.\n\n### Follow the progress of jobs\n\nüí° You can already check the progress of your workflow by simply observing the\ncurrent working directory where lots of new task-specific folders are being\ncreated. However, there are also formal ways to check the progress of your jobs\nas shown below.\n\n1. Monitor the status of submitted *Slurm* job:\n\n   ```\n   squeue -j <slurmjobid>\n   # or\n   squeue --me\n   # or\n   squeue -u $USER\n   ```\n\n2. Monitor the progress of the individual sub-tasks using HyperQueue commands:\n\n   ```\n   module load hyperqueue\n   export HQ_SERVER_DIR=$PWD/hq-server-<slurmjobid>\n   hq worker list\n   hq job list\n   hq job info <hqjobid>\n   hq job progress <hqjobid>\n   hq task list <hqjobid>\n   hq task info <hqjobid> <hqtaskid>\n   ```\n\n### How to clean task-specific folders automatically?\n\nüí≠ HyperQueue creates task-specific folders (`job-<n>`) in the same directory\nfrom where you submitted the batch script. These are sometimes useful for\ndebugging. However, if your code is working fine, the creation of many folders\nmay be annoying besides causing some load on the Lustre parallel file system.\nYou can prevent the creation of such task-specific folders by setting `stdout`\nand `stderr` HyperQueue flags to `none` as shown below:\n\n```bash\nsnakemake -s Snakefile -j 24 --use-singularity --executor cluster-generic --cluster-generic-submit-cmd \"hq submit --stdout=none --stderr=none --cpus 5\"\n```\n\n## More Information\n\n- [Docs CSC: Snakemake apps page](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/snakemake/)\n- [Official Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snakemake is a workflow management system that allows for the automation of bioinformatics analysis pipelines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HyperQueue is a meta-scheduler designed to efficiently manage and schedule tasks across computing resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a computing node or cluster where Snakemake workflows can be executed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lustre is a type of parallel file system used in high-performance computing environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCS CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docs CSC refers to the documentation and support pages provided by CSC - IT Center for Science in Finland for various computing applications, including Snakemake)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>Snakemake submits jobs to HyperQueue for task scheduling and execution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>PUHTI<|>Snakemake workflows can be executed on the Puhti computing cluster<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>LUSTRE<|>Snakemake workflows may cause load on the Lustre file system when creating task-specific folders<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>DOCS CSC<|>Docs CSC provides documentation and support for using Snakemake<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
