This mode\n    reserve 1 core to the operating system. In order to get a more balanced \n    layout, we also disabled the first core in each of the 8 L3 region. As a\n    consequence only 56 cores are available to the jobs. Jobs requesting 64 \n    cores/node will never run.\n\nCorrect CPU and GPU binding is important to get the best performance out of the\nGPU nodes. The reason is that each of the 4 NUMA nodes is directly linked to \none of the 4 MI250x GPU modules. You can query this topology using the `rocm-smi`\ncommand with the `--showtoponuma` option.\n\n```\n $ rocm-smi --showtoponuma\n\n====================== Numa Nodes ======================\nGPU[0]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 3\nGPU[0]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 3\nGPU[1]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 3\nGPU[1]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 3\nGPU[2]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 1\nGPU[2]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 1\nGPU[3]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 1\nGPU[3]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 1\nGPU[4]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 0\nGPU[4]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 0\nGPU[5]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 0\nGPU[5]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 0\nGPU[6]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 2\nGPU[6]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 2\nGPU[7]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 2\nGPU[7]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 2\n================= End of ROCm SMI Log ==================\n```\n\nAs you can see, there is no direct correspondence between the numbering of the \nNUMA nodes and the numbering of the GPUs (GCDs). As a consequence, depending on\nhow the rank and threads of your application choose the GPU to use, you may need\na combination of CPU and GPU binding options.\n\n####  Application that can select GPU automatically\n\nIf your application automatically selects the GPU to use by using the node local\nrank, i.e., the first rank on the node selects GPU 0, the second selects GPU 1, ...,\nthen it is recommended to reorder the assignment of rank to NUMA node so that:\n\n- rank 0 and 1 are assigned to NUMA node 3, close to GPUs 0 and 1\n- rank 2 and 3 are assigned to NUMA node 1, close to GPUs 2 and 3\n- rank 4 and 5 are assigned to NUMA node 0, close to GPUs 4 and 5\n- rank 6 and 7 are assigned to NUMA node 2, close to GPUs 6 and 7\n\nFor an MPI application, not using OpenMP, the binding can be achieved by\nlaunching the application using the following command\n\n```\nsrun --cpu-bind=map_cpu:49,57,17,25,1,9,33,41 <app> <args>\n```\n\nFor a hybrid MPI+OpenMP application, the binding can be achieved by launching\nthe application using the following command\n\n```\nCPU_BIND=\"mask_cpu:fe000000000000,fe00000000000000\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe0000,fe000000\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe,fe00\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe00000000,fe0000000000\"\n\nsrun --cpu-bind=${CPU_BIND} <app> <args>\n```\n\n####  Application that cannot select GPU automatically\n\nFor an application that cannot select a GPU automatically, in addition to CPU binding\ndescribed in the previous section, you can use a wrapper script to set the GPU binding.\n\nThis script sets `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the value of the Slurm-defined `SLURM_LOCALID`\nenvironment variable so that:\n\n- for node local rank 0, `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`\n- for node local rank 1, `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1`\n- ...\n\n```\ncat << EOF > select_gpu\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\\$SLURM_LOCALID\nexec \\$*\nEOF\n\nchmod +x ./select_gpu\n\nsrun <cpu-binding-opt> ./select_gpu <app> <args>\n```\n\n### Distribution\n\nTo control the distribution of the tasks, you use the `--distribution=<dist>` \noption of `srun`. The value of `<dist>` can be subdivided in multiple levels for\nthe distribution across for the nodes, sockets and cores.
