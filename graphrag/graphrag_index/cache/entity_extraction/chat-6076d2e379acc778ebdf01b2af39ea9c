For commercial customers and\nacademic customers who require more than what is granted from the\nministry's paid-for allocation, CSC has billing unit packages for\npurchase.\n\nFor more information about which category your project falls into,\nplease see\n[Accounts and projects](https://research.csc.fi/accounts-and-projects){ target=\"_blank\" }.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Accounting for resources\n\nCurrently, we account for virtual machines, volume storage, object\nstorage and floating IPs.\n\n| Resource | Cost |\n|------------------|--------------------|\n| Virtual machines | See [Flavors](vm-flavors-and-billing.md) |\n| Storage volumes | 3,5 BU / TiB hour |\n| Floating IPs | 0,2 BU / hour |\n\nPlease note that virtual machines consume BUs regardless whether you are using\nthem or not. This means that a shut down or suspended virtual machine\nstill consumes BUs. You can find more information about the different\nstates of virtual machines and their BU consumption in\n[Virtual machine lifecycle](vm-lifecycle.md). The minimum accounting time for a\nvirtual machine is one hour. Another source for estimating usage is the\n[Resource calculator](https://research.csc.fi/billing-units/#buc).\n\nStorage volumes consume billing units based on their size. The unit of\nmeasure is [TebiByte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebibyte) hours. Storage\nvolumes consume BUs even if they are not attached to virtual machines.\n\nObjects storage consumes billing units based on the stored data\namounts. The billing units are consumed until the data is removed.\n\nFloating IPs are billed if they are allocated to a project or\nassigned to a virtual machine. Any extra routers you create and\nconnect to the external network will be also billed for one floating\nIP. The default router included in the project does not consume\nbilling units.\n\n## Other costs\n\nIf you have a contract with CSC, you will always be billed according\nto the contract even if it differs from these practices. Commercial\ncustomers are usually also billed a fee for each member of the\nproject.\n\n## Quotas\n\nEach cPouta and ePouta project has a cloud computing quota that\nlimits the use of simultaneous cloud resources. There is a default\ncPouta project quota which is quite small, but users can apply for\nextensions by sending email to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).\n\n**Default size of the cPouta project quota.**\n\n| Resource type | default |\n|----------------|:-------:|\n| Instances | 8 |\n| Cores | 8 |\n| Memory | 32 GB |\n| Floating IPs | 2 |\n| Storage | 1 TB |\n\nWith the default resources, a cPouta user could launch eight\n*standard.tiny* instances or two *standard.large* instances or one\n*hpc-gen1.8core* instance. The purpose of the quota is to prevent\nindividual users from reserving the entire cluster and thus preventing\nother users from accessing it.\n\nStorage is also limited by a quota. The default quota for new projects\nis 1 TB. Additional allocations can be requested by sending email\nto [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).\n\nThe initial quotas for ePouta projects are agreed upon when starting a new project.\n\nPlease note that having free quota does not guarantee that specific\nresources are available.\n\nSpecific virtual machine flavors may be full, so you cannot provision\nthem even if you have the quota to do so. We always strive to have\nfree computing resources in some flavors. We are planning to improve the\nvisibility of which flavors are available in the future.\n\nWe try to always have free storage and floating IP resources, if quota\nfor them has been allocated.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
