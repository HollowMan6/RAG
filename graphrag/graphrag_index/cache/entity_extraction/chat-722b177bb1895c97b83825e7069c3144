This is \nnot the only option and if you have already an Apptainer installed elsewhere, you can skip these steps and \nuse your own Apptainer environment.\n\n**Step 3** describes one approach to how you can build your own software containers.\n\n**Step 4** shows how a container is uploaded to Allas.\n\n**Step 5** describes how the software installed in a container can be used in SD Desktop.\n\n## 1. Creating your own Apptainer workbench to cPouta\n\nIn order to utilize all features of Apptainer you must run it in an environment where you have administrator level access rights. At CSC, you can have administrator level access in virtual machines running in cPouta. Using cPouta for the building process adds a bit of extra steps into the process: you have to know how to launch and access virtual machines in cPouta. On the other hand cPouta has a fast connection to the Allas service that is used to import the ready-made containers to SD Desktop.\n\nAs a first step, launch a virtual machine in cPouta, as described in the cPouta user guide:\n\n*  [Launching a virtual machine with the cPouta web interface](../../cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui.md)\n\nand for example these tutorial videos:\n\n*  [Launching a virtual machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvoN4pv0RJQ) and connecting to it on a local macOS laptop\n*  [Creating a virtual machine in cPouta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIO8KRbgDoI) a webinar recording.\n\nIn this tutorial we use a virtual machine that was launched using:\n\n*  Flavor: **Standard.medium**\n*  Instance Boot Source: **Image**\n*  Image Name: **Ubuntu-22.04**\n\n\n## 2. Installing singularity and Allas tools to Ubuntu 22.04 server\n\nHere we start from a situation where we have logged in to our freshly started virtual machine for the first time. As preparatory steps we need to install to our virtual machine **Apptainer** to create new software containers and **allas-tools** to upload the containers we will create to Allas.\n\n\nThe singularity installation is done with commands:\n\n```text\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y software-properties-common\nsudo apt-get install apt-utils\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:apptainer/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y apptainer\n```\n\nAfter which Allas tools can be installed with:\n\n```text\nsudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev\nsudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\nsudo pip3 install python-openstackclient\nsudo apt install python3-swiftclient\ncurl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash\ngit clone https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils\n```\n\nNote that this installation process needs to be done only once for a virtual machine.\n\n## 3. Creating an Apptainer container\n\nThere are many ways to create new Apptainer containers. You can crate a container by creating a _sandbox_ in to which you log in and add content by typing installation commands. Alternatively you can automatize the installation process so that you collect all the commands and settings to an Apptainer _definition file_ that instructs the installation process. A detailed view to the container building can be found from the [Apptainer user guide](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/build_a_container.html).\n\nHere we use a mixture of these two approaches. We first use a simple definition file to create a new container sandbox that contains a set of tools for software installation. Then we open a shell session to the container sandbox and do the actual software installations manually.\n\n### 3.1 Definition file\n\nFirst open a new file called `ubuntu_with_inst_tools.def` with command:\n\n```text\nnano ubuntu_with_inst_tools.def\n```\n\nAnd copy-paste to the new file the content from the sample definition file below:\n\n```text\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:20.04\nStage: build\n\n%environment\nexport TZ=Europe/Helsinki\nexport LC_ALL=C\nexport LC_NUMERIC=en_GB.UTF-8\nexport PATH=\"/opt/miniconda/bin:$PATH\"\n\n%help\nContainer based on unbuntu containing miniconda.\n\n%runscript\n# sample runscript: bamtools passing all arguments from cli: $@\n# exec /opt/miniconda/bin/bamtools \"$@\"\n\n%post\n#commands to help installation processes\nln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone\napt update\napt install -y wget bzip2 git autoconf automake build-essential \napt install -y zlib1g-dev pkg-config nano\n\n#install conda\ncd /opt\nrm -fr miniconda\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh  -O miniconda.sh\nbash miniconda.sh -b -p /opt/miniconda\nmkdir -p /opt/tools\nexport PATH=\"/opt/tools/bin:/opt/miniconda/bin:$PATH\"\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nconda config --set channel_priority strict\n```\n\n### 3.2 Creating and using\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
