When a command and program is running interactively, i.e. the\ncommand shell is waiting that the execution finishes, you can terminate\nthe execution by pressing `Ctrl-c`. Another possibility is to\nhalt the program by pressing `Ctrl-z`. When a command (or process) is\nhalted, it can be continued with `fg` command or changed to be executed\nas a background process with command `bg`.\n  \nA command that is still running can be terminated with `kill`\ncommand. To be able to use `kill`, you need to know the *process\nidentification number* (PID) of the command you want to terminate. You\ncan check your active processes, meaning the commands that you are\ncurrently executing, with command `ps`. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ ps\nPID TTY          TIME CMD\n385 pts/12   00:00:00 tcsh\n2001 pts/12   00:00:00 eog\n2003 pts/12   00:00:00 gconfd-2\n2203 pts/12   00:00:00 ps\n```\n\nBy default, the `ps` command shows only those processes that have been\nlaunched from the command shell you are currently using. To see all your\nprocesses in the server you have logged in to, give command:\n\n```bash\nps -f username\n```\n\nOnce you have identified the correct process number, you can kill the\nprocess with command:\n\n```bash\nkill PID\n```\n\nFor example, the command\n\n```bash\nkill 2001\n```\n\nwould kill the `eog` process, listed in the output of the previous `ps`\nexample. You can only kill processes that are owned by your account.\nSometimes when you want to kill a process that is malfunctioning, the\nnormal kill command may not able to terminate the process. In those\ncases you can try to terminate the process by adding option `-9` to\nthe `kill` command:\n\n```bash\nkill -9 PID\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FG<|>EVENT<|>Foreground process command used to continue a halted command or process in the foreground)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CTRL-C<|>EVENT<|>Keyboard interrupt to terminate a command or process execution interactively)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CTRL-Z<|>EVENT<|>Keyboard interrupt to halt a command or process execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BG<|>EVENT<|>Background process command used to continue a halted command or process in the background)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KILL<|>EVENT<|>Command used to terminate a running command or process by using its PID)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PS<|>EVENT<|>Command used to check active processes, showing commands currently executing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PID<|>EVENT<|>Process Identification Number, a unique identifier for each running command or process)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CTRL-C<|>KILL<|>Both CTRL-C and the kill command can be used to terminate a running process<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CTRL-Z<|>FG<|>After halting a process with CTRL-Z, it can be continued with the fg command<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CTRL-Z<|>BG<|>After halting a process with CTRL-Z, it can be continued as a background process with the bg command<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PS<|>PID<|>The ps command is used to display the PID of active processes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KILL<|>PID<|>The kill command requires a PID to terminate a specific process<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
