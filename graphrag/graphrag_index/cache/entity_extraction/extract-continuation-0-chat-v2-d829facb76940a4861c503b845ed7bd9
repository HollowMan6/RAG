There is no single\nsimple definition of sensitive data but rather it is derived from national and\nEU legislations.[^1] Some guidelines can be found from\n[here](https://research.csc.fi/definition-of-sensitive-data).\n\nNote that the topics discussed here are not applicable to such data that is\ncontrolled by law of secondary use of health and social data. More information\nabout using CSC with secondary use data can be found\n[here](../sensitive-data/sd-desktop-audited.md).\n\nThe **data controller** — meaning the customer, i.e. usually the\nresearch project or a researcher — is responsible for knowing if the data\nis sensitive or not and handling it appropriately. In case of using CSC's data\nservices for research the question about sensitivity of the data must be\nresolved by the customer already before transferring the data to CSC's\nservices, which acts as **data processor** that provides storage and computing\nresources for the data controller.\n\nGeneric examples of use cases where CSC's services might be used with encrypted\nsensitive data are:\n\n- Using CSC sensitive data services for analyzing data\n- Distributing sensitive research data to customer's partner organizations\n- Disaster recovery copy of customer's local sensitive research data\n- Sharing sensitive research data within a research group\n\nSome use cases may not be applicable to all CSC's data services, please see the\nTerms and Conditions and Service Description of each service itself.\n\nCSC provides a set of services that are intended to support management of\nsensitive data. Currently, these services include:\n\n- [SD Connect](../sensitive-data/sd_connect.md): A service for storing and\n  sharing sensitive data\n- [SD Desktop](../sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md): A service for processing\n  sensitive data\n\nThese services provide secure and easy-to-use tools and protocols that CSC\nrecommends using for sensitive data. However, you can store sensitive data at\nCSC also by using other tools, as long as the processes follow the general\nguidelines described below.\n\n## Encryption\n\nProtecting data with encryption has been around for a long time and the basics\nof secure encryption are well understood. This document gives some best\npractices on how to encrypt the data once the customer has decided that\nencryption is an appropriate way to protect the data content.\n\nThere are two main encryption methods, _symmetric_ and _asymmetric_ encryption.\nIn symmetric encryption, the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting the\ndata. In basic asymmetric encryption, there are two keys, a _private key_ and a\n_public key_. Data encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the\nprivate key. For verifying the origin of data, the data (normally a hash of the\ndata) signed with the private key can be verified with the public key.\n\nIn a general data storage use case, straightforward symmetric encryption\nis usually a good choice. In that general case, all who need access to the data\ncontent — for instance a research group — are equal, they all know the same\nsymmetric key.\n\nWhen the use case is more targeted to data distribution and has specific\nrecipient(s) for the data, asymmetric encryption has advantages in key\nmanagement. The data uploader could use the recipient's asymmetric public key\nto encrypt, or actually encrypt the recipient-specific symmetric key with it.\nThe key management is more flexible with asymmetric encryption, but the\ndrawback is that there is a copy of the data for each recipient.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis document gives some best practices on how to encrypt data if storing it in\nto CSC's data services for research. The decision whether encryption is an\nappropriate way to protect the data content against unwanted exposure is at\nthe responsibility of the customer.\n\nA customer's own environment is out of the scope of this document. As the\nsensitive data exists at the customer's own environment already before it will\nbe stored (transferred) to CSC's data service, this document assumes that all\nthe necessary safeguards at the customer side — policies, procedures,\npractices, etc. — are already in place.\n\nClassified data, which requires separation by the service other than access\ncontrol is out of the scope of this document.[^7]\n\nComputational processing of data is out of the scope of this document too, as\nthis document simply describes the best practices for storing sensitive data.\nYou can access CSC's data services for research directly from your own\nenvironment just like from CSC's supercomputing environment. From the point of\nview of the service there is no difference from where the data is transferred\nto it.\n\n## Risks of encryption\n\nUsing encryption to protect data reduces the risk to expose the data content to\nunwanted parties, but it also introduces some new risks which need to be\nconsidered. This chapter highlights the main two risks.\n\n1. **Losing your encryption keys** — or to be more precise, the key to\n   decrypt the data — is equivalent to losing your data. If you still have\n   your data files but don't have the decryption key anymore, you can't restore\n   the actual data content. You need to plan how to manage your keys before you\n   start to use data encryption, more details on this can be found in\n   [Key management](#key-management).\n2. **Using poor encryption tools.** Picking just some nice or reliable looking\n   software to take care of encryption may well introduce a risk of exposing\n   the data content. It may be unintentional like poor software engineering or\n   weak algorithms in the software. It may also\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides data services for research, including storage and computing resources, and is responsible for managing sensitive data according to national and EU legislations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service provided by CSC for storing and sharing sensitive data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service provided by CSC for processing sensitive data)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>SD CONNECT<|>SD Connect is a service offered by CSC for storing and sharing sensitive data<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>SD DESKTOP<|>SD Desktop is a service offered by CSC for processing sensitive data<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
