In order\nto illustrate these _Kubernetes API objects_, an Apache HTTP server application\nis constructed by writing plain text YAML representations of these objects.\n\nThe objects minimally required defined in the cluster to have the\nserver running:\n\n1. A pod that runs the container.\n1. A service that exposes the pod internally and gives it a predictable name.\n1. A route that will expose the service to the internet by redirecting\n   traffic from `<myservice>.2.rahtiapp.fi` to the service object.\n\n!!! info\n\n    In practice, you should not deploy applications the way described in this\n    tutorial. Instead, it is meant for learning the core concepts of\n    Kubernetes.\n\n![Network](../img/routeServicePod.drawio.svg)\n\n## Preparation\n\nMake sure you have the `oc` command line installed, and that you are logged in. Please check the [command line tool installation](../rahti2/usage/cli.md) if you need help on that.\n\n## Projects\n\nThe command `oc projects` shows the projects you have access to:\n\n```bash\n$ oc projects\nYou have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc\nproject <projectname>':\n\n    someone-elses-public-project\n  * my-project-with-unique-name\n\nUsing project \"my-project-with-unique-name\" on server \"https://api.2.rahti.csc.fi:6443\".\n```\n\n!!! info\n\n    The listing may include projects that other users have created to host\n    public Docker images. While it is possible to switch to these projects, you\n    only have read-only access to the Docker images hosted in them.\n\nIf there is no single suitable project, a new one can be created with the command `oc\nnew-project`:\n\n```bash\noc new-project my-project-with-unique-name\n```\n\nThe name of the project needs to be unique across the Rahti 2 container cloud, and\nmoreover, the name may only contain letters, digits and hyphen symbols, and it\nis not case sensitive. In essence, the name needs to be usable as part of a DNS\nname.\n\nIf you are a member of multiple CSC projects with access to Rahti 2, the description of the\nproject must contain `csc_project: #######`, where `#######` is the project\nthat should be billed (see\n[Projects and quota](../rahti2/usage/projects_and_quota.md)).\nThe description can be included in the `new-project` command:\n\n```bash\noc new-project my-project-with-unique-name --description='csc_project: #######'\n```\n\nSwitch between projects using the command `oc project`:\n\n```bash\noc project another-project\n```\n\n## Pods and the command line interface\n\nPods are objects that run one or more containers. The containers in a pod\nshare an IP address, and they can communicate via `localhost` or shared memory.\nConsequently, they need to be executed in a single physical node.\n\nIn our case, the pod will run a container image with a web server installed in\nit:\n\n*`pod.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mypod\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n    pool: servepod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: serve-cont\n    image: \"image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/httpd\"\n```\n\nThis pod will run one container image specified in the field\n`spec.containers.image`.\n\nThe name of the pod is provided in `metadata.name`. The pod can be referred to\nusing `oc`:\n\n```bash\noc get pods mypod\n```\n\nThe field `metadata.labels.pool` is an arbitrary key-value pair that enables\nthe pods to be grouped and referred by e.g. _services_.\n\nThe Kubernetes API objects are represented in the YAML format.\n[Short introduction to YAML](yaml_introduction.md).\n\nPods and other Kubernetes/OpenShift API objects are created with the `oc`\ncommand line utility:\n\n```bash\noc create -f pod.yaml\n```\n\nThe pod should now appear in the \"Overview\" page in OpenShift's web console when\nthe project is viewed.\n\nPods can be deleted using the command `oc delete`:\n\n```bash\noc delete pod mypod\n```\n\nConsequently, the pod should disappear from the OpenShift web console, but let us\nkeep this one running for now.\n\n----\n\n### Resource requests and limits\n\nTypically, you allocate _resources_ to containers using _requests_ and\n_limits_, but in these examples, we refrain from doing that for the sake of\nbrevity. If no values are provided, default values will be used instead. The\nsame pod as above with memory and CPU resources of 200 MB to 1 GB and 0,2 CPU\nto 1 CPU would read as:\n\n*`pod.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mypod\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n    pool: servepod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: serve-cont\n    image: \"image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/httpd\"\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        memory: \"200M\"\n        cpu: \"200m\"\n      limits:\n        memory: \"1G\"\n        cpu: \"1\"\n```\n\nRead more about requests and limits in the [Kubernetes\ndocumentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE HTTP SERVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A free and open-source cross-platform web server software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2 CONTAINER CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cloud service that provides a platform for deploying, managing, and running containerized applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODS<|>EVENT<|>Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICES<|>EVENT<|>Services in Kubernetes are an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROUTES<|>EVENT<|>Routes in Kubernetes are objects that allow external access to services within a cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPLICATIONCONTROLLERS<|>EVENT<|>ReplicationControllers are Kubernetes objects that ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OC COMMAND LINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command line tool for managing OpenShift applications and services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A family of containerization software developed by Red Hat)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODS<|>SERVICES<|>Services expose Pods to the network<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICES<|>ROUTES<|>Routes make Services accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODS<|>REPLICATIONCONTROLLERS<|>ReplicationControllers manage the lifecycle of Pods<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OC COMMAND LINE<|>OPENSHIFT<|>OC command line is used for managing OpenShift applications and services<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OC COMMAND LINE<|>RAHTI 2 CONTAINER CLOUD<|>OC command line is used for interacting with Rahti 2 Container Cloud<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>PODS<|>Pods are a core concept in Kubernetes for deploying containers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>SERVICES<|>Services are a core feature in Kubernetes for exposing applications<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ROUTES<|>Routes are used in Kubernetes environments like OpenShift to expose services externally<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>REPLICATIONCONTROLLERS<|>ReplicationControllers are part of Kubernetes' system for ensuring application availability<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
