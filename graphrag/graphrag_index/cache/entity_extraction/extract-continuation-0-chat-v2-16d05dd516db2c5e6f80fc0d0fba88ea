Let's now use interactive R to look at the results.\n\n### e) Collect the results and plot them.\n\nNote, plotting will work only if you have \n[remote X11 forwarding](../../computing/connecting/index.md#graphical-connection).\nActually, for R, there is even a tailored remote setup using \n[RStudio Server](../../apps/r-env.md),\nand you're welcome to use that, but in this tutorial, the key point is to \ndemonstrate the general approach.\n\nIn the folder containing `analyse.R` start the interactive R shell with\n```\nstart-x\n```\n\nIn the R shell that opens, write `source(\"analyse.R\")`. This will \nrun (source) the script contents. The original data was\ncreated by calculating the y values by y=2x + some random noise.\nThe plot will appear in a separate window.\n\n### f) How do the fit coefficients match that?\n\n## Batch job with thread parallelization\n\nSome applications can be run in parallel to speed them up. In this\nexample you run the [HMMER software](../../apps/hmmer.md) to describe \nand analyze related or similar protein sequence areas both in serial \nand parallel to see if the jobs speed up.\n\nHMMER uses a database that is already installed, but the protein\nsequences you want to study need to be copied first to be used as input:\n\n```\nwget https://a3s.fi/docs-files/example.fasta\n```\n\n### a) Serial HMMER job\n\nLet's first run the job with just one core. Copy one of the old batch\nscripts to current directory, and change / add the following items in\nit (or take a look at [these examples](../../computing/running//example-job-scripts-puhti.md)):\n\n1. Output to `out_%j.txt`\n1. error to `err_%j.txt`\n1. run time 10 minutes\n1. load the `hmmer` -module\n1. remove the R specific environment settings\n1. run command:\n\n```\nhmmscan $PFAMDB/pfam_a.hmm example.fasta > example_1.result\n```\n\nSubmit the job with: `sbatch your-jobscript-name.sh`\n\nSubmitting the job echoes the SLURM JOBID number to the screen, but\nthat is also shown in the output and error filenames\n(`out_<SLURM_JOBID>.out`). Check if the job is running with\n\n`squeue -u <your username>` (use *your* username)\n\nOr\n\n`squeue -j <SLURM_JOBID>` (replace with the JOBID of your job)\n\nOnce the job is finished you can check how much memory and time it used:\n\n```\nsacct -j <SLURM_JOBID> -o elapsed,reqmem,maxrss\n```\n\n- **Did you reserve a good amount of memory? (not excessively too much, but\nenough to not be close to memory running out and terminating the job).**\nAnother way to get a quick summary of used resources is:\n\n```\nseff <SLURM_JOBID>\n```\n\n### b) Parallel HMMER job\n\nNow, let's try with 4 cores. At this point we'll also switch to using\nthe environment variable `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` to avoid mistakes\nand the need to change that in many places. Add this line to the batch\nscript:\n\n```\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n```\n\nNote that this only asks the _queuing_system_ for more resources. You need to tell it also\nto the application you're running (how, depends on the application). Change the run command to:\n\n```\nhmmscan --cpu $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK $HMMERDB/Pfam-A.hmm example.fasta > example_$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK.result\n```\n\nAs you've asked for 4 cpus per task, the environment variable\n`$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` evaluates to 4 when the script is run, and\nyou only need to change the number on the #SBATCH line if you want to try other\nnumbers as well.\n\nSubmit the job and check with the `sacct` command how long it took to\nrun the hmmer job and how did the memory usage change and try to answer\nthese questions:\n\n- **Does it make sense to use 4 cores instead of 1?**\n- **Was the memory reservation ok?**\n- **Does it make sense to use more than 4 cores?**\n- **How to speed up the job?**\n\n## Batch job memory consumption\n\n### a) Exceed memory allocation on purpose\n\nCreate a new _R-script_ (like in the previous exercise) named `mem-test.R`. It\nshould have the following contents:\n\n```\ndim=10\ndim_end=1000\nwhile (dim < dim_end) {\nmat <- matrix(rnorm(dim*dim), dim)\nprint(\"passed dimension\")\nprint(dim)\ndim=dim*2\n}\nprint(\"all done\")\n```\n\nVariable `dim` is the dimension of the square matrix, which will be\nfilled with normal distributed random numbers. The script doubles\n`dim` until it exceeds `dim_end`. Make a new _batch script_ to run your\nR-script `mem-test.R`. In addition to the resource requests your\nscript needs to load the R-environment and then run the R-script (as in\nprevious exercise). Submit the script with `sbatch`.\n\nOnce the job has been completed (how can you check if it is running or\nqueuing?),\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>R<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R is a programming language and environment commonly used for statistical computing and graphics\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSTUDIO SERVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RStudio Server is an integrated development environment for R that facilitates remote use and collaboration\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HMMER SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HMMER is software for searching sequence databases for sequence homologs, and for making sequence alignments.
