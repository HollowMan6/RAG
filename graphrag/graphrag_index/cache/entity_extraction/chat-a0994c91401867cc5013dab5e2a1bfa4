Start the lock manager:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> vgchange --lockstart shared_vg1\n    ```\n\n1. **On one node**, run:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> lvcreate --activate sy -L <size>G -n shared_lv1 shared_vg1\n    $> mkfs.gfs2 -j <number_of_nodes> -p lock_dlm -t ClusterName:FSName /dev/shared_vg1/shared_lv1\n    ```\n    ClusterName is the name of the cluster (you can retrieve the information with the command `pcs status`)  \n    FSName is the file system name (i.e: gfs2-demo)\n\n1. Create an LVM-activate resource to automatically activate that logical volume on all nodes:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs resource create sharedlv1 --group shared_vg1 ocf:heartbeat:LVM-activate lvname=shared_lv1 vgname=shared_vg1 \\\n        activation_mode=shared vg_access_mode=lvmlockd\n    ```\n\n1. Clone the new resource group:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs resource clone shared_vg1 interleave=true\n    ```\n\n1. Configure ordering constraints to ensure that the locking resource group that includes the dlm and lvmlockd resources starts first:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs constraint order start locking-clone then shared_vg1-clone\n    ```\n\n1. Configure a colocation constraints to ensure that the vg1 resource groups start on the same node as the locking resource group:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs constraint colocation add shared_vg1-clone with locking-clone\n    ```\n\n1. Verify on the nodes in the cluster that the logical volume is active. There may be a delay of a few seconds:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> lvs\n        LV         VG         Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert\n        shared_lv1 shared_vg1 -wi-a----- <size>g\n    ```\n\n1. Create a file system resource to automatically mount the GFS2 file system.  \n   Do not add it to the /etc/fstab file because it will be managed as a Pacemaker cluster resource:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs resource create sharedfs1 --group shared_vg1 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=\"/dev/shared_vg1/shared_lv1\" \\\n        directory=\"/mnt/gfs\" fstype=\"gfs2\" options=noatime op monitor interval=10s on-fail=fence\n    ```\n\n1. You can verify if the GFS2 file system is mounted:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> mount | grep gfs2\n    $> pcs status --full\n    ```\n\n\n### GFS2 FAQ\n\n* **How to add more nodes?**\n\n    It is possible to add new nodes to a GFS2 cluster. The supported **limit** is **16** nodes.\n\n    First you need to make sure there are enough journal entries. Use `gfs2_edit` to get the total number of journals:\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo gfs2_edit -p jindex /dev/vdb | grep journal\n    ```\n\n    If it is not enough, you can easily add more with `gfs2_jadd`: \n\n    ```sh\n    $> sudo gfs2_jadd -j 1 /mnt\n    Filesystem: /mnt\n    Old journals: 15\n    New journals: 16\n    ```\n\n    Secondly, create the new node, install the required software and attach the volume using openstack API. The process is described above.\n\n    Then you need to edit the file `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf` in every node and add an entry for the new one:\n\n    ```json\n    node {\n     ring0_addr: cinder-gfs2-16\n     nodeid: 16\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Once the file is updated, you need to stop the mount and restart the dlm and corosync daemons in every node in the cluster.\n\n    Finally, you just need to mount the volume:\n\n    ```sh\n    $> pcs resource create sharedfs1 --group shared_vg1 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=\"/dev/shared_vg1/shared_lv1\" directory=\"/mnt/gfs\" fstype=\"gfs2\" options=noatime op monitor interval=10s on-fail=fence\n    ```\n\n* **What happens if a VM gets disconnected?**\n\n    This covers two different use cases, a temporal and/or unexpected disconnection, and a permanent one.\n\n    For a temporal and unexpected disconnection, the cluster should be able to deal with this kind of issues automatically. After the node is back, you need to check that all came back to normal. In some cases the automatic mount of the volume can fail, if so mount the volume as explained above.\n\n    If it is temporal but expected, like to update the kernel version. Umount the volume in the node before rebooting the node. It is not required, but recommended.\n\n    For a permanent disconnection of a VM, one need to do the inverse process of adding a new node. Umount the volume, remove the entry for this VM in the `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf` file of every node, and finally restart the daemons in every node. This needs to be done as it affects the quorum\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
