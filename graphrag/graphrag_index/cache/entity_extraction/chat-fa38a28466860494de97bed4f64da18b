PEFT supports many\nmethods including [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) and\n[QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314).\n\nPEFT will typically have about 10% of the original number of\nparameters, but the amount of GPU memory saved varies depending on the\nsituation. We have seen savings from 5% to 60%.\n\nPEFT is very easy to enable, see the [PEFT quicktour][6] for an\nexample. PEFT can be enabled in the example above simply by adding the\nflag `--peft`. It might pay to [dig a bit deeper into the best\nparameters for using LoRA for example][8].\n\n\n### Using Accelerate and FSDP\n\nFor larger models that do not fit into the GPU memory (even for\ninference), you need to use an approach that splits the actual model\n(and the training overhead) over multiple GPUs. We can no longer\nretain a full copy of the model in each GPU.\n\nA good approach, which is supported natively in PyTorch is [Fully\nSharded Data Parallel (FSDP)][7]. In FSDP the model parameters,\ngradients and optimizer states are not stored completely in each GPU,\nbut are split up (sharded) between all GPUs and only gathered together\nas needed in the current stage of the training.\n\nPerhaps to easiest way to take FSDP into use for large language models\nis to use Hugging Face's Accelerate framework. No changes are needed\nto the PyTorch script, one only needs to change to the `accelerate`\nlauncher. [Our GitHub repository][2] has example scripts for launching\non one or two full nodes on Puhti:\n\n- [`run-finetuning-puhti-gpu4-accelerate.sh`](https://github.com/CSCfi/llm-fine-tuning-examples/blob/master/run-finetuning-puhti-gpu4-accelerate.sh) - fine-tuning on Puhti with one full node using Accelerate\n- [`run-finetuning-puhti-gpu8-accelerate.sh`](https://github.com/CSCfi/llm-fine-tuning-examples/blob/master/run-finetuning-puhti-gpu8-accelerate.sh) - fine-tuning on Puhti with two full nodes using Accelerate\n\n(The repository also has scripts for Mahti if you check the file\nlisting.)\n\nOur [Multi-GPU and multi-node ML guide](ml-multi.md#accelerate) also\nhas Slurm script examples for using Accelerate with FSDP.\n\nThere are two things to note when using Accelerate: \n\n1. The `accelerate` launcher expects to have a configuration YAML\n   file. We have provided two examples in the GitHub repository,\n   `accelerate_config.yaml` for a basic example and\n   `accelerate_config_fsdp.yaml` for using FSDP. These configs use\n   reasonable default parameters, but it might be useful to tweak\n   those, especially [take a look at FSDP's parameters][9].\n\n2. For multi-node runs you need to launch the `accelerate` launcher\n   separately on each node with the `--machine_rank` argument set\n   according to the rank of the node (0=first node, 1=second node\n   etc). We can use the `$SLURM_NODEID` variable to set this, but we\n   need to use a shell trick so that it isn't evaluated until it\n   actually runs in the specific node. (See the script\n   [`run-finetuning-puhti-gpu8-accelerate.sh`](https://github.com/CSCfi/llm-fine-tuning-examples/blob/master/run-finetuning-puhti-gpu8-accelerate.sh)\n   for an example of how this can be done.)\n\nYou can also use PEFT (LoRA) with Accelerate with the `--peft` in our\nexample script.\n\n\n## Inference\n\nInference, that is using the model rather than training it, is usually\nmuch simpler. Our [example git repository][2] has an inference example\nin `inference-demo.py` and `run-inference-puhti.sh`. If your model\ndoesn't fit into a single GPU, you can simple reserve more GPUs and\nthen let Hugging Face sort it out by setting `device_map='auto'` when\nloading the model, for example:\n\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(args.model, device_map='auto')\n```\n\n[1]: https://blog.eleuther.ai/transformer-math/\n[2]: https://github.com/CSCfi/llm-fine-tuning-examples\n[3]: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index\n[4]: https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B\n[5]: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index\n[6]: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/quicktour\n[7]: https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/\n[8]: https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
