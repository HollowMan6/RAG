Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2.

Other types are under consideration.\n\nIf you need another type of database, you may deploy it yourself in\n[cPouta cloud](../../cloud/pouta/index.md). In this case, you should request a\nvirtual machine and then just follow the instructions provided by the database\nof your choice. Use security groups to give network access to your database.\n\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n    When using\n    [security groups](/cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui/#firewalls-and-security-groups),\n    pay special attention to open only the necessary port(s) to the necessary\n    IP(s).\n\n## When is Rahti a good place to deploy a Database?\n\nRahti is a good choice if the application that needs to connect to the database\nis already deployed in Rahti. Rahti only accepts network connections from\noutside Rahti using the HTTP(s) protocol in ports 80 and 443.\n\nOne way to connect to Rahti from CSC supercomputers is to establish a TCP\ntunnel over an HTTP-compatible WebSocket connection. See\n[Accessing databases on Rahti from CSC supercomputers](../../cloud/tutorials/connect-database-hpc.md)\nfor more details about this workaround.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
