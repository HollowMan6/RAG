If a directory or file with the same name already exists, you must either remove the existing file or directory, or assign the downloaded data to a new directory with the `-target` option.\n\nOptions:\n\n- **-p**, **--project _project_ID_** Retrieve data from the buckets of the defined project instead of the currently configured project. \n- **-f**, **--file _file_name_** Retrieve only a specific file or directory from the stored dataset. **Note:** Define the full path of the file or directory within the stored object.\n- **-d** **--target_dir** <dir_name> If this option is defined, a new target directory is created and the data is retrieved there.\n- **-t** **--target_file** <file_name> Define a file name for the object for the object to be downloaded.\n- **-l** **--original_location**       Retrieve the data to the original location in the directory structure.\n- **--asis**                        Download the object without unpacking tar files and uncompressing zst compressed data.\n- **--s3cmd**                       Use S3 protocol and s3cmd command for data retrieval in stead of Swift protocol and rclone.\n\nAt the moment, _a-get_ can download only one object at a time. If you need to download large number of objects you need to use loops. For example to download all the objects in bucket _bucket_123_ , you could use commands:\n\n```text\n#make a list of objects\na-list bucket_123 > object_list_bucket123\n\n#use the list in for loop\nfor ob in $(cat object_list_bucket123)\ndo\n  a-get $ob\ndone  \n\n#remove the object list\nrm object_list_bucket123\n```\n\n\n## a-delete<a name=\"a-delete\"></a>\na-delete is used to remove data that has been uploaded to Allas service using the a-put command.\nThe basic syntax of the command is:\n<pre>a-delete object_name</pre>\n\nBy default _a-delete_ asks user to confirm the removal of an object. This checking can be skipped with option `-f`.\n\nIf you want to remove a bucket, you can use option `--rmb`. By default _a-delete --rmb_ removes only empty buckets. If you want to delete non-empty bucket, you need to add option `--FORCE` to the command.\n\n## a-access<a name=\"a-access\"></a>\n\nBy default, only project members can read and write the data in a bucket.\nMembers of the project can grant read and write access to the bucket and \nthe objects it contains, for other Allas projects or make the bucket publicly\naccessible to the internet.\n\n**a-access** is a tool to control access permissions (swift protocol) of a bucket in Allas.\n\nSyntax \n```text\na-access +/-type project_id bucket\n```\nOptions:\n\n- **+r**,  **+read** <project_id>        Grant read access to the bucket for the project.\n- **+w**,  **+write** <project_id>       Grant write access to the bucket for the project.\n- **+rw**, **+read-write**  <project_id> Grant read and write access to the bucket for the project.\n- **-r**,  **-read** <project_id>        Remove read access from the bucket.\n- **-w**,  **-write** <project_id>       Remove write access from the bucket.\n- **-rw**, **-read-write**  <project_id> Remove read and write access from the bucket to the project.\n- **+p**,  **+public**                   Give public read-only access to the bucket.\n- **-p**,  **-public**                   Remove public read-only access to the bucket.\n\nFor example, to allow members of project: _project_2001234_ to have read-only access to bucket: _my_data_bucket_, you can use command:\n```text\na-access +r project_2001234  my_data_bucket\n```\nThe access permissions are set similarly to the corresponding _segments bucket too.\n\nNote, that bucket listing tools don't show the bucket names of other projects,\nnot even in cases were the project has read and/or write permissions to the bucket.\n\nFor example in this case a user, belonging to project _project_2001234_, \ndon't see the _my_data_bucket_ in the bucket list produced by command:\n```text  \na-list\n```\nbut the user can still list the contents of this bucket with command:  \n```text\na-list my_data_bucket\n```\nAnd download objects from the bucket with a-get.\n\na-access manages the access permissions only in the project and bucket level.\nUse **swift post** command for more sophisticated access control.\n\nIf you run _a-access_ command for a bucket without any modification options,\nit will print out the current settings of the bucket.\n\n\n### Configuring your a-commands\n\nA users can modify the default settings of a-commands by making a configuration file named as **.a_tools_conf** to their **home\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a data storage service used for storing, retrieving, and managing data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-PUT<|>EVENT<|>A command used to upload data to the Allas service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-INFO<|>EVENT<|>A command used to list basic information of all objects in the current project or a specific object in Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-GET<|>EVENT<|>A command used to download data from the Allas service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-DELETE<|>EVENT<|>A command used to remove data from the Allas service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-ACCESS<|>EVENT<|>A command used to control access permissions of a bucket in Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>.A_TOOLS_CONF<|>EVENT<|>A configuration file for modifying the default settings of a-commands)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-PUT<|>ALLAS<|>A-PUT is a command specifically designed for uploading data to Allas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-INFO<|>ALLAS<|>A-INFO is a command used for retrieving information about objects stored in Allas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-GET<|>ALLAS<|>A-GET is a command for downloading data stored in Allas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-DELETE<|>ALLAS<|>A-DELETE is a command for removing data from Allas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-ACCESS<|>ALLAS<|>A-ACCESS is a command for managing access permissions to data in Allas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>.A_TOOLS_CONF<|>ALLAS<|>The .a_tools_conf file is used to configure the behavior of commands interacting with Allas<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
