See [Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/gaussian/#license)\nfor details on how to get added.\n\n## Overview\n\nðŸ’¬ [HyperQueue](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/hyperqueue/) is a tool for efficient\nsub-node task scheduling and well suited for task farming and running\nembarrassingly parallel jobs.\n\nðŸ’¬ In this example, we have several similar molecular structures and would like\nto know how they differ energetically.\n\n- The aim is to run Gaussian calculations on 200 different structural isomers\n  corresponding to the C<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>H<sub>10</sub> molecular\n  formula.\n- The computational cost of each of the 200 calculations is expected to be\n  comparable.\n- We will use the `sbatch-hq` wrapper which allows easy execution of many\n  commands without needing to write a batch script.\n\n### The workflow of this exercise\n\n1. Download 200 sample molecular structures.\n2. Convert these structures to Gaussian format.\n3. Construct the corresponding Gaussian input files.\n4. Build a `sbatch-hq` command list to run the jobs.\n5. Submit the job using the `sbatch-hq` wrapper.\n6. Analyze the results.\n\n## Download 200 sample 3D molecular structures\n\n1. Create and enter a suitable scratch directory on Puhti (replace `<project>`\n   with your CSC project, e.g. `project_2001234`):\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER/gaussian-hq\n   cd /scratch/<project>/$USER/gaussian-hq\n   ```\n\n2. Download the 200 C<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>H<sub>10</sub> structures that\n   have originally been obtained from the\n   [QM9 dataset](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.978904.v5):\n  \n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/C7O2H10.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n3. Unpack the archive:\n\n   ```bash\n   tar -xzf C7O2H10.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n4. Go to the directory containing the structure files that are in [`.mol`\n   format](https://openbabel.org/docs/FileFormats/MDL_MOL_format.html):\n\n   ```bash\n   cd C7O2H10\n   ```\n\n## Convert the structures to Gaussian format\n\nðŸ’¬ [Gaussian](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/gaussian/) is a program for molecular\nelectronic structure calculations.\n\n1. Use [OpenBabel](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/openbabel/) to convert the\n   structures to Gaussian format:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load openbabel\n   obabel *.mol -ocom -m\n   ```\n\n2. Now we have converted the 200 structures into `.com` format that is used by\n   Gaussian.\n\n## Construct the corresponding Gaussian input files\n\nðŸ’¬ In this example we want to do a `b3lyp/cc-pVDZ` calculation on these\nstructures, i.e. a hybrid density functional theory calculation using the\nB3LYP exchange-correlation functional and the cc-PVDZ basis set.\n\n1. Add the `b3lyp/cc-pVDZ` keyword at the beginning of each `.com` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   sed -i '1s/^/#b3lyp\\/cc-pVDZ \\n/' *.com\n   ```\n\n2. Set 4 cores per job by adding the flag `%NProcShared=4` to each input file:\n\n   ```bash\n   sed -i '1s/^/%NProcShared=4\\n/' *.com\n   ```\n\n3. Now you have 200 complete Gaussian input files corresponding to the original\n   molecular structures and the method of choice.\n\n## Build a command list to run the jobs as a HyperQueue task array\n\nðŸ’¬ A task array can sometimes be lengthy, so rather than typing it by hand, it\nis more feasible to use bash scripting to create a suitable task list file for\nHyperQueue.\n\n1. Move back up to your main directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd ..\n   ```\n\n2. Create the task list and name it `commandlist`:\n\n   ```bash\n   for f in ${PWD}/C7O2H10/*.com; do\n     echo \"g16 < ${f} >> output/$(basename ${f%.*}).log\" >> commandlist\n   done\n   ```\n\n3. Inspect the task list with `more`, `less` or `cat`. The file should look\n   like:\n\n   ```bash\n   g16 < /scratch/<project>/$USER/gaussian-hq/C7O2H10/dsC7O2H10nsd_0001.com >>\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer at CSC that offers services for computing and data management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is the Finnish IT center for science, providing computing and data management services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HyperQueue is a tool for efficient sub-node task scheduling, suitable for task farming and running embarrassingly parallel jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAUSSIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gaussian is a program for molecular electronic structure calculations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENBABEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenBabel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages of chemical data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QM9 DATASET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The QM9 dataset contains data on molecular structures that have been obtained for research purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C7O2H10<|>GEO<|>C7O2H10 refers to the molecular formula for a set of 200 sample molecular structures)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a service provided by CSC for computing and data management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>PUHTI<|>HyperQueue is used on Puhti for efficient task scheduling and running parallel jobs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAUSSIAN<|>C7O2H10<|>Gaussian calculations are to be run on the C7O2H10 molecular structures<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENBABEL<|>C7O2H10<|>OpenBabel is used to convert the C7O2H10 structures to Gaussian format<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QM9 DATASET<|>C7O2H10<|>The C7O2H10 structures were originally obtained from the QM9 dataset<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
