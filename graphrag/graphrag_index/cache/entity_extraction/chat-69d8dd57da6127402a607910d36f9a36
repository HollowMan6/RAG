In\naddition, GROMACS itself includes numerous post-processing utilities for\nanalyzing trajectories. See the\n[command-line reference](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/cmdline.html)\nfor details.\n\n#### Running heavy/long analyses\n\nVisualization of large trajectories, as well as certain GROMACS tool scripts,\ncan be computationally very demanding and should never be run on the login\nnodes (see [usage policy](../computing/usage-policy.md)). Instead, please run\nsuch workloads in an\n[`interactive` session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md). Since we\nonly provide the MPI-version of GROMACS, you need to prepend your `gmx_mpi`\ncommand with `orterun -n 1`, e.g.:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project>\nmodule load gromacs-env\norterun -n 1 gmx_mpi msd -n index -s topol -f traj\n```\n\nAs most GROMACS analysis utilities, such as the `msd` tool above, can only be\nrun in serial, they might take quite long for large trajectories. In such cases\nit may be more convenient to run the tools as [serial batch jobs](#puhti). If\nthe command you want to run requires interaction (e.g. to select which parts of\nyour system to include in the analysis), you may pass these in a batch job for\nexample like this:\n\n```bash\n# Three consecutive selections (options 2, 2 and 0), you need to know these beforehand\necho \"2 2 0\" | gmx_mpi trjconv -f traj -s topol -o trajout -pbc cluster -center\n```\n\nNote that you may use the `interactive` partition (time limit 7 days) also in\nbatch jobs if the 3 day time limit of `small` is not enough. The 14-day\n`longrun` partition has a very low priority and using it will often require\nsubstantial queueing. Another viable option is to use the\n[persistent compute node shell](../computing/webinterface/index.md#shell)\navailable through the web interfaces, which will keep running even if you close\nyour browser or lose internet connection.\n\n## References\n\nCite your work with the following references:\n\n> - S.
