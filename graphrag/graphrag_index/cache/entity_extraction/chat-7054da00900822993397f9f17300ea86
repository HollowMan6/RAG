Note that it is not possible to rename buckets.\n\n7.  Next, click on _Encrypt and upload_: each file will be automatically encrypted and uploaded to the specified bucket in SD Connect. \n\n    ![Encryption](images/connect/encryption.png)\n\n8. Once the process is completed, you can return to the SD Connect browser window. The encrypted files will be displayed in the correct bucket, in a default folder called _DATA_, and each encrypted file will have the extension `.c4gh`. \n\nThe files are now encrypted with three encryption keys:\n\n- With the default Sensitive Data services encryption key. Thus, you can access and analyze the data stored in SD Connect with the SD Desktop service (for further information, see SD Desktop user guide).\n\n- With your public key. This allows you to download the data stored from SD Connect to, for example, different services and decrypt them using the correspondent secrete key. \n\n - With your collaborator's public key. This allows sharing (or transferring) the data with your collaborator using SD Connect. Next, they will be able to download and decrypt the files in their secure computing environment using the correspondent secret key. \n\nThis workflow allows managing only one copy of the data for different purposes.\n\n!!! Note\n    With this workflow is possible to encrypt only small files (up to 1GB). If you have any questions or the instructions above need clarification (e.g. encryption of larger files), don't hesitate to [contact us](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Sensitive Data). We also provide step-by-step support online (e.g. via Zoom).\n\n\n## Data sharing \n\nSD Connect user interface provides a simple way of sharing buckets between different projects.\n\nTo share a bucket with another CSC project (and thus one of your colleagues or collaborators), you need to:\n\n* know in advance the project identifier you want to share a bucket with (see above the _User Interface_ paragraph);\n\n* in the browser page, click on the _share_ button next to the bucket's name;\n\nNext:\n\n1. In the _Browser_ page, next to the bucket name, click the _share_ icon\n\n2. You will be redirected to the _Share the bucket_ page. Here you can select:\n\n      * only _Grant read permission_ if you want your colleagues to be able to access the files and folder stored in the bucket, download them or access them via the SD Desktop service;\n\n      * or _Grant write permissions_ if you want your colleague to be able to add files and folders to the shared bucket. If you select only this option, your colleague will be only able to add files to the bucket but not be able to see its content.\n\n3. Under _Project Identifiers to share with_, you can add the identifiers corresponding to your collaborator's CSC project. It is possible to add multiple identifiers. \n\n4. Next, click on _Share_. If the operation is successful, you will be redirected to the _Share from the project_ view, where are listed all the buckets shared with other CSC projects. From the same page, it is possible to interrupt the sharing by clicking on _Revoke bucket access_.\n\n![sd-connect-6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/122786188-ba869980-d2bc-11eb-93be-cde0f14d0795.png)\n\n![SD-Connec-7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/124917332-5d008580-dffc-11eb-9c70-3647e9538f79.png)\n\n![sd-connect-8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/122786632-2ec13d00-d2bd-11eb-966a-ad2eb6be2589.png)\n\n## Data download and decryption\n\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"155\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQJ8QEKV7BE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nYou can easily download entire buckets or single encrypted files from the SD Connect _Browser page_ by clicking on _download_. \n\nNext, you can decrypt the data using the Crypt4GH application and your secret encryption key. Unfortunately, it is currently only possible to single files. However, we are working on adding this option and integrating it with the SD Connect user interface.\n\n1. Open the Crypt4GH application and click on _load Your Private Key_.\n\n2. Click on _Select File_ and upload the file you want to decrypt.\n\n3. Click on _Open_.\n\n4. Next, click on _Decrypt File_.\n\n5. The tool will ask you to write the secret key's password. Press _ok_. \n\nThe secret key must match the public key used to encrypt the data.\nIn the case of decryption, adding the public key is not mandatory, but if you have the public key of the person who has encrypted the file, you can use it to verify the encryption signature. If you don't select a public key, the activity log will display the following (the decryption will be executed anyway):\n\n```\nSender public key has not been set, authenticity will not be verified.\n```\n\nIf your decryption runs successfully, the activity log will display the following:\n\n```\nDecrypting.....\n\nDecryption has finished\n\nDecrypted file: C:/users/username/exampledirectory/examplefile\n```\n\n![Download](images/connect/download.png)\n\n![Decryption](images/connect/decryption.png)\n\nThe decrypted file will no longer display the `.c4gh` extension and will be saved in the same folder from which the original file was uploaded.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
