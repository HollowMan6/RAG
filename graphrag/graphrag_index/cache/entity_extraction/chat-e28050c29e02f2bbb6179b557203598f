It is especially\nuseful for building and maintaining installations of many different versions of\nthe same software. It also comes with a virtual environment feature that is\nuseful when developing software.\n\nLUMI provides a module to load a pre-configured Spack instance: `module load spack`. When you load this module, you will use a Spack instance configured to compile software with the Cray programming environment. The software will be installed in a location determined by you in the environmental variable `$SPACK_USER_PREFIX`. This Spack instance is \"chained\" to the upstream instance in `/appl/lumi/spack`, which means that you can build new packages on top of the already installed ones by the LUMI User Support Team (similar to how the LUMI EasyBuild setup works).\n\n!!! important \"The software installed with Spack in /appl/lumi/spack/ is provided as is.\"\n    It may not have received any testing after installation! We also build the\n    software there in a more fool-proof way with slightly less optimization:\n    Zen2 architecture instead of Zen3, OpenBLAS instead of Cray LibSci, and\n    Netlib Scalapack. This may have a small impact on performance, but is\n    usually fine.\n\n## Using Spack on LUMI\n\n**To install software with Spack**, perform the following steps. In this\nexample, we will install [kokkos](https://kokkos.org/about/), a C++ parallel\nprogramming framework, into a hypothetical project storage folder\n`/project/project_465000XYZ/spack`. We want to configure this package with AMD\nGPU support and activate extra array bounds checking for debugging.\n\n1. Initialize Spack.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ export SPACK_USER_PREFIX=/project/project_465000XYZ/spack \n    $ module load spack/23.09\n    ```\n\n    We recommend that you set `$SPACK_USER_PREFIX` in e.g. your `.bash_profile`\n    file to avoid having to set it every time you want to use Spack.\n\n2. Check the information Spack has about the package and especially the\n   configuration options:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ spack info kokkos\n    ```\n\n    From reading the package information, it becomes clear that the install command should be:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ spack install kokkos+rocm+debug_bounds_check amdgpu_target==gfx90a %gcc@12.2.0\n    ```\n\n    The flag `+rocm` activates GPU support, and `+debug_bounds_check` adds the\n    array bounds checking. We also need to specify the type of GPU:\n    `amdgpu_target==gfx90a` (note the double equal signs which has the special meaning of propagating the GPU target to all dependencies). In this case, we give no explicit specification of a compiler, which means that Spack will choose gcc 11.2.0 for us when compiling.\n    \n3. Before installing, it is good practice to check the dependencies that Spack\n   will install. Sometimes this can be many, many, packages! Running this\n   command can take some time (up to a few minutes):\n\n    ```console\n    $ spack spec -I kokkos+rocm+debug_bounds_check amdgpu_target==gfx90a %gcc@12.2.0\n    Input spec\n    --------------------------------\n    -   kokkos%gcc@12.2.0+debug_bounds_check+rocm amdgpu_target==gfx90a\n\n    Concretized\n    --------------------------------\n    -   kokkos@4.1.00%gcc@12.2.0~aggressive_vectorization~compiler_warnings~cuda~debug+debug_bounds_check~debug_dualview_modify_check~deprecated_code~examples~hpx~hpx_async_dispatch~hwloc~ipo~memkind~numactl~openmp~openmptarget~pic+rocm+serial+shared~sycl~tests~threads~tuning~wrapper amdgpu_target=gfx90a build_system=cmake build_type=Release cxxstd=17 generator=make intel_gpu_arch=none arch=linux-sles15-zen2\n    [^]      ^cmake@3.27.7%gcc@12.2.0~doc+ncurses+ownlibs build_system=generic build_type=Release arch=linux-sles15-zen2\n    [^]          ^curl@8.4.0%gcc@12.2.0~gssapi~ldap~libidn2~librtmp~libssh~libssh2+nghttp2 build_system=autotools libs=shared,static tls=openssl arch=linux-sles15-zen2\n    [^]              ^nghttp2@1.57.0%gcc@12.2.0 build_system=autotools arch=linux-sles15-zen2\n    [^]              ^openssl@3.1.3%gcc@12.2.0~docs+shared build_system=generic certs=mozilla arch=linux-sles15-zen2\n    [^]                  ^ca-certificates-mozilla@2023-05-30%gcc@12.2.0 build_system=generic arch=linux-sles15-zen2\n    [^]                  ^perl@5.38.0%gcc@12.2.0+cpanm+opcode+open+shared+threads build_system=\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
