Note that not all (by far) features are supported.\n\n    [Reference - Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/){ .md-button target=_blank }\n\n!!! info \"Source\"\n\n    This page is more useful when viewed side-by-side with [the Markdown source at GitHub](https://github.com/CSCfi/csc-user-guide/blob/master/docs/ref.md?plain=1){ target=_blank }.\n\nThis page contains some elements that are available in Docs CSC. For example, here we have some\nbody text [with an external link](https://example.com){ target=_blank }. **Some of it is\nboldfaced**, *some italicized*. `Some might be monospaced`. Some acronyms, like HPC, are\ndefined automatically (see: [Glossary](#glossary)).\n\n> There's even text in a blockquote. The blockquote has some filler text after an empty line. I\nlike to imagine it's what a typewriter would dream.\n>\n> Vel suscipit quia voluptates quis. Rerum sequi voluptatem in non ipsam tempora quod natus.

Laboriosam autem vel vel aut quod.\n\nHere's a reference to a footnote:[^1]\n\nAs you can see here:\nin some cases [external links](https://example.com){ target=_blank } followed by text _italicized_\nusing underscores will produce unwanted results. *Italicize* with asterisks instead.\n\n\n## Banners\n\nThe front page can be fitted with a banner to promote a course for example.\n\n![Banners at Docs](img/ref/screenshot-of-reference-banner.png)\n\nThere is currently no special mechanism in place for controlling banners.\n\n=== \"index.md\"\n\n    There is a `<center>` block in _index.md_ to hold the banner. The images themselves\n    should go to _docs/img/banners/_. The width of the image can be controlled with a\n    `width` attribute. A `target=_blank` attribute should be present when a link\n    is pointing outside of Docs.\n\n    ```html\n    <center>\n      [![A description of the banner](img/banners/example-banner.png){ width=80% }\n      ](https://example.org/courses/example-course/){ target=_blank }\n    </center>\n    ```\n\n=== \"Show/hide\"\n\n    To hide the banner, it can just be commented out (mind that the commented-out `<center>`\n    block will still be visible in the HTML source of the page):\n\n    ```html\n    <!--\n    <center>\n      [![A description of the banner](img/banners/example-banner.png){ width=80% }\n      ](https://example.org/courses/example-course/){ target=_blank }\n    </center>\n    -->\n    ```\n\n\n## Glossary\n\nThere is a glossary of HPC-related acronyms that get highlighted automatically. For example: CPU,\nGPU, QPU, etc. The acronyms are defined in the markdown file\n_csc-overrides/assets/snippets/glossaries/hpc.md_. More acronyms (case-sensitive) can be added there or into another\nmarkdown file, like so:\n\n=== \"another_glossary.md\"\n\n    ```markdown\n    *[GNU]: GNU's not Unix!\n    *[DFT]: 1. Discrete Fourier Transform, 2. Density Functional Theory\n    ```\n\n=== \"mkdocs.yml\"\n\n    ```yaml\n    markdown_extensions:\n    - ...\n    - pymdownx.snippets:\n        base_path: csc-overrides/assets/snippets\n        auto_append:\n        - glossaries/hpc.md\n        - glossaries/another_glossary.md\n    - ...\n    ```\n\nThe glossary is also viewable as a page at [docs.csc.fi/glossary](support/glossary.md).\n\n\n## Headings\n\nThe heading for Headings is a heading of a heading level 2. Remember to only use one heading level\n1 heading on your page and to keep the heading hierarchy intact. So no skipping levels.\n\n\n### This is a heading level 3 heading\n\nThat one's a level 3. Here is some text under it.\n\n\n#### Now for a level 4 heading\n\nSome text _four_ it here.\n\n\n##### Level 5 heading: `now with added monospace`\n\nNo text this time.\n\n\n###### Level 6\n\nMore text coming up next in Text.\n\n\n## Text\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
