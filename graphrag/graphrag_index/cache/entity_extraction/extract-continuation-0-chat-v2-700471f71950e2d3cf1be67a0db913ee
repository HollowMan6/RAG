Providing comprehensive metadata and documenting the data lifecycle according to your discipline's conventions makes your data understandable, discoverable, and reusable. \n\n**Metadata**, data about data, can have multiple meanings and the documents described above that explain how data should be interpreted can also be called metadata. However, in these pages we use the term metadata referring to **discovery metadata**, the 'label' of your data, which is needed when data is published and shared. \n\n**Data documentation** means creating information, which enables the interpretations of the data correctly and independently. It consists of files that explain how data were created or digitized, how the data should be interpreted, its structure, and how the data has been modified. This information can also be called *data-level* documentation or even metadata as it is information about data. Documenting data should be considered as best practice when managing data and it is also essential for data preservation. Whenever data are used sufficient contextual information is required to interpret the data correctly and independently. \n\n## Metadata types\n\nMetadata is information regarding the data, for example, where, when, why, and how the data were collected, processed and interpreted. Metadata may also contain details about experiments, analytical methods, and research context.\n \n![Discovery metadata. Data documentation. Data.](../../img/levels-of-openness_v1.png \"Discovery metadata. Data documentation. Data.\")\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n \n### Discovery metadata\n\nDiscovery metadata can be of three types: Descriptive, Administrative and Structural.\n\n***Descriptive metadata***\n\nDescriptive metadata of a dataset can be divided into two subcategories:\n\n**1) core metadata** *or study level metadata* (for discovery and identification - for search and citation), which includes:\n\n * a persistent identifier to be used when citing the dataset or reporting re-use\n * general information about the dataset (title, the field of science, keywords, content coverage, variables)\n * information about agents (creators, contributors, publisher, distributor)\n * information about access (download link or access information and rights statements)\n * information about lifecycle events and related entities (provenance)\n * technical information like checksum, size, file format, media type\n\n**2) data documentation (also called *detailed descriptive metadata* or data-level metadata)** (variable configurations, work-flows, processing code etc. - for enabling assessment and reuse). More about detailed descriptive metadata in [Data documentation](#data-documentation-also-called-detailed-descriptive-metadata-or-data-level-metadata).\n\n ***Administrative metadata***\n\nAdministrative metadata includes information about the rights of the dataset. This means information about license, type of restriction and reason for it (ethical, legal etc.), embargo time, owner of the rights, contact for reuse as well as how to apply for use permit and access.\n\nOther categories of administrative metadata include technical metadata (file types etc. information needed for rendering files) and preservation metadata.\n\n***Structural metadata***\n\nStructural metadata describes how the dataset is organized internally and how it relates to other datasets (managing versions etc.). In some disciplines, data are published and shared with community endorsed standards and schemas, which are a formal and machine actionable way of expressing the structural metadata. Schemas are used to express the scientific domain, structure, relationships, field labels, and parameter-level standards for the dataset as a whole. A schema enables data to be shared, merged or transferred between information systems without losing the meaning or structure of the data (i.e. data are interoperable). In addition to implementing technical standards and schemas, securing semantic interoperability between different data requires using and referring to published semantic artefacts.\n\n \n!!! note \"Note\"\n\n    You can use [Qvain - Research Dataset Metadata Tool](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/qvain/), to create core, administrative and structural metadata for your dataset. \n    \n    It will be published in [Etsin - Research Data Finder](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/services/etsin/).\n\n\n\n### Data documentation (also called *detailed descriptive metadata* or data-level metadata)\n\nIf you have additional metadata that does not fit in the data catalogue, additional metadata and **documentation** like code books or configuration files can be added to the dataset as separate files. This metadata can also be innate within the data files. Remember that this can make the data harder to find. If you add extra metadata:\n\n1. Use metadata standards if possible: Repositories often require the use of a specific metadata standard; *structured formats that use specific vocabularies or ontologies in describing the data*. Check whether a discipline/community or repository based metadata schema or standard (i.e., preferred sets of metadata elements) exists that can be adopted. Discipline-specific standards can be found in the [Digital Curation Centre website](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards).\n    - Some research instruments create standardized metadata formats automatically. Choose a standard which is compatible with other software, if possible.\n2. Use separate metadata files or metadata included in the data files, configuration files, license deeds, code books and other data or information that is important for the replication and reuse of the data.\n    - Readme file(s) providing information about data files to ensure correct interpretation\n    - Data dictionary / Code book explaining variables in the data and gathering codes used in a dataset.\n\nAlso, think about your file naming conventions, directory structure and **version control**. More about that in [Data organization](#data-organization).\n\n!!! note \"Data documentation can be done by using:\"\n    - (domain specific) metadata and data standards \n    - electronic laboratory notebooks\n    - dictionaries and vocabularies\n    - readme-files \n    \n    and they all take part in explaining what the project data is and what\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>METADATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Metadata refers to data about data, including discovery metadata which is essential for data publication and sharing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA DOCUMENTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Data documentation involves creating detailed information for the correct and independent interpretation of data, including its creation, structure, and modifications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISCOVERY METADATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Discovery metadata includes descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata necessary for data discovery, access, and management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESCRIPTIVE METADATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Descriptive metadata provides details for the discovery and identification of a dataset, including core metadata and detailed descriptive metadata)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADMINISTRATIVE METADATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Administrative metadata includes information about the rights, license, restrictions, and technical requirements of a dataset)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRUCTURAL METADATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Structural metadata describes the internal organization of a dataset and its relationship to other datasets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QVAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Qvain is a tool for creating core, administrative, and structural metadata for research datasets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ETSIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Etsin is a service for finding research data, where datasets with metadata created using Qvain are published)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>METADATA<|>DATA DOCUMENTATION<|>Metadata is a broader category that includes data documentation as a subset for explaining data's context and structure<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISCOVERY METADATA<|>DESCRIPTIVE METADATA<|>Discovery metadata encompasses descriptive metadata among other types for data discovery and sharing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISCOVERY METADATA<|>ADMINISTRATIVE METADATA<|>Administrative metadata is a type of discovery metadata focusing on data rights and technical information<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISCOVERY METADATA<|>STRUCTURAL METADATA<|>Structural metadata is part of discovery metadata, detailing dataset organization and standards<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QVAIN<|>ETSIN<|>Datasets created with Qvain's metadata tools are published in Etsin for research data discovery<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
