However, applying commonly used\nfile name extensions will help you and other users to select right\ncommands for processing the file later on. The newly created tar archive\nfile can now be easily moved to another directory or system and then\nunarchived with the extract (`x`) command:\n\n```bash\ntar xvf project_3.tar\n```\n\nThis command will create a directory called `project_3`, which contains\nall the same files as the original directory did. Note that if the\nextract command encounters a file that already exists in the file\nsystem, the existing file will be overwritten by the extracted file.\nThis causes a potential danger: possibly a newer version of a file will\nbe lost if an older version of the same file (or, just a file with the\nsame name) exists in the tar archive that is being unarchived!\n\n| Command    | Operation                                                              |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `A`        | Append tar files to an archive (i.e. concatenate archive files)        |\n| `c`        | Create a new tar archive                                               |\n| `d`        | Find differences between an archive and the file system                |\n| `r`        | Append files at the end of an archive                                  |\n| `t`        | List the contents of an archive                                        |\n| `u`        | Only append files that are newer than the existing ones in the archive |\n| `x`        | Extract files from an archive                                          |\n| `--delete` | Delete files from the archive                                          |\n\nIn addition to the commands above, the option `f` (file) is almost\nalways used as it defines the name of the tar file to read from or to\nwrite to. The file name must follow right after the option, thus it is\ncommonly the last option given. Below are some frequently used tar\noptions.\n\n| Option | Function                                                                    |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `f`    | Use the given file name as the source or target archive                     |\n| `v`    | Be verbose, i.e. list processed files to the screen while processing        |\n| `z`    | Use gzip compression/decompression while creating or extracting an archive  |\n| `j`    | Use bzip2 compression/decompression while creating or extracting an archive |\n\nWith options `z` (zip) or `j` (no meaning, it was chosen because no\nmeaningful letter was available) you can filter the archive\nthrough `gzip` or `bzip2`, respectively, to (de)compress the archive on\nthe fly:\n\n```bash\ntar cvzf project_3.tar.gz project_3\n```\n\nHere, in this sample case, the size of the uncompressed archive file is\n52 MB, but the compressed file is only 15 MB.\n\n```bash\n$ ls -lh\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 2 testuser csc   11 Nov  9 10:44 project_3\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  52M Nov  9 10:46 project_3.tar\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  15M Nov  9 10:56 project_3.tar.gz\n```\n\nListing the contents of a tar archive file can be done with command\n`t` (list):\n\n```bash\n$ tar tf project_3.tar\nproject_3/\nproject_3/sample3.txt\nproject_3/sample4.txt\nproject_3/sample5.txt\nproject_3/sample2.txt\nproject_3/sample1.txt\nproject_3/sample6.txt\nproject_3/sample8.txt\nproject_3/sample9.txt\nproject_3/sample7.txt\n```\n\nYou can also retrieve just one file from the archive by specifying the\nfull file name to the data extraction command. For example, to extract\njust file `sample2.txt` from the compressed archive `project_3.tar.gz` we\ncould use command:\n\n```bash\ntar xvzf project_3.tar.gz project_3/sample2.txt\n```\n\n## Compressing files\n\nCompressing files saves storage space and makes data transport faster,\nbut it may take a lot of time. Data compression is CPU intensive and\ncompressing a data set of several terabytes can easily require overnight\ncomputing.\n\nThere are numerous algorithms and software tools available for data\ncompression. Here, we will briefly show five tools that are used in\nUnix/Linux systems: *gzip*, *bzip2*, *zip*, *7z* and *Zstandard*. What is\ncommon to all these tools is that they do the compression without data\nloss, i.e. when the files are uncompressed the data will be 100%\nidentical to the original data. Typically, a text file compressed with\none of these tools is about 20-40% of the size of the original file.\nHowever, the compressibility of a file depends heavily on the content of\nthe file.\n\nThe compression time depends on the algorithm used and the type of data\nto be compressed. In most cases the newer Zstandard method is\nsignificantly faster than the older, but very widely used methods like\ngzip or zip. The table below shows results for one sample case,\nwhere a 10 GB text file (fastq-formatted sequence data) was compressed with\nthese five methods in the Puhti supercomputer using default command settings.\n\n| Command | Size of the<br>compressed file<br>(original size 10GB) | Compression\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT_3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A directory that contains files related to a project, which can be archived and extracted using tar command)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GZIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software application used for file compression and decompression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BZIP2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software application used for file compression and decompression, known for its high compression ratio)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file format that supports lossless data compression, can also refer to software that handles zip files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>7Z<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file format with a high compression ratio, used by the 7-Zip software for data compression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZSTANDARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A compression algorithm offering high compression ratios and fast decompression speeds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI SUPERCOMPUTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A supercomputer used for data compression tests, showing the performance of various compression methods)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_3<|>GZIP<|>Project_3 can be compressed using GZIP compression, resulting in a .tar.gz file<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_3<|>BZIP2<|>Project_3 can be compressed using BZIP2 compression, indicating the versatility of compression options for the project<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GZIP<|>ZIP<|>Both GZIP and ZIP are used for file compression, but they use different algorithms<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BZIP2<|>7Z<|>Both BZIP2 and 7Z are known for their high compression ratios compared to other methods<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZSTANDARD<|>PUHTI SUPERCOMPUTER<|>Zstandard's performance was tested on the Puhti Supercomputer, showcasing its efficiency<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
