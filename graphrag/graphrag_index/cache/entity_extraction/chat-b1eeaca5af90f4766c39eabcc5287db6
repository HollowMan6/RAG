Since\n    there are four GPUs per node, and Slurm interprets each GCD as a separate\n    GPU, you can reserve up to 8 \"GPUs\" per node. See more details in\n    [LUMI Docs](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumig/).\n\n#### Notes about binding and multi-GPU simulations on LUMI\n\nOnly certain CPU cores are directly linked to a specific GPU on LUMI, so to\nmaximize multi-GPU performance, it is important to ensure that CPU cores are\nbound to the GPUs accordingly. The full GPU node example above takes care of\nthis, and also excludes the first core of each group of 8 cores linked to a\ngiven GCD. These are reserved for the operating system to reduce noise, meaning\nthat there are only 56 cores available per node. This is also why we run 7\nthreads per MPI rank, not 8.\n\n!!! error \"Note\"\n    Please note that CPU-GPU binding only works when reserving full nodes by\n    running in the `standard-g` partition or by using the `--exclusive` flag.\n    See more details in LUMI Docs:\n    [LUMI-G hardware](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumig/),\n    [LUMI-G examples](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumig-job/),\n    [GPU binding](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/distribution-binding/#gpu-binding)\n\nInstead of communicating between GPUs through the CPU, direct GPU communication\nwill also bring significant performance benefits when running on multiple GPUs.\nEnabling this requires setting the following environment variables in your\nbatch script (see also the full GPU node example above):\n\n```bash\nexport MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1\nexport GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM=1\nexport GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI=1\n```\n\nBelow is a comparison of the performance of GROMACS 2024.3 on Mahti (CPUs and\nGPUs) and LUMI-G using the STMV benchmark (1067k atoms, 2 fs timestep). This is\na large system which scales very well also on GPUs. The performance of a single\nLUMI GCD (half a GPU) is about the same as a full Nvidia A100 GPU on Mahti, and\nmuch better than a single 128-core CPU node. Importantly, the availability of\nGPU nodes on LUMI is massive compared to Mahti (2978 vs. 24).\n\n![GROMACS scaling on GPUs on Mahti and LUMI](../img/stmv.png 'GROMACS scaling on GPUs on Mahti and LUMI')\n\n!!! info \"Small systems and high-throughput simulations\"\n    While medium-sized and large systems (few 100k to 1M+ atoms) can typically\n    utilize multiple GPUs well, small systems (less than 100k atoms) are often\n    best run on just a single GCD. A good way to further increase the GPU\n    utilization and efficiency of small simulations is to share one GCD between\n    multiple independent trajectories. This can be accomplished using the\n    built-in multidir feature of GROMACS. For more details about GPU-sharing\n    and aggregate sampling, see our\n    [tutorial on high-throughput simulations with GROMACS](../support/tutorials/gromacs-throughput.md).\n\n#### GPU PME decomposition\n\nThe scalability of huge systems with several million atoms may be limited by\nsingle GPU PME. To significantly improve scalability, decomposition of PME work\nto multiple GPUs is possible in modules suffixed with `-heffte` which have been\nlinked to the [heFFTe library](https://icl-utk-edu.github.io/heffte/). Add the\nfollowing exports to your batch script:\n\n```bash\nexport GMX_GPU_PME_DECOMPOSITION=1\nexport GMX_PMEONEDD=1\n```\n\nThe number of PME ranks to use depends on the specific case, but 1 or 2 per GPU\n*node* should be a reasonable starting point. So for 16 LUMI-G nodes, try\n`-npme 16` or `-npme 32`.\n\n### Visualization and analysis\n\nGROMACS trajectory files and data can be visualized, for example, with the\nfollowing programs:\n\n- [VMD](vmd.md) visualization program for large biomolecular systems\n- [Grace](grace.md) plotting data produced with GROMACS tools\n- [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) Python library to analyze\n  trajectories from MD simulations\n    - Not available at CSC, but can be easily installed by the user in a\n      containerized Conda environment with\n      [Tykky](../computing/containers/tykky.md)\n- [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) molecular modeling system (not available at\n  CSC)\n\nMore are listed in the\n[GROMACS manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/how-to/visualize.html). In\naddition, GROMACS itself includes numerous post-processing utilities for\nanalyzing trajectories.
