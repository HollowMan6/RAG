For fast computation, they utilize *parallelism* (and typically have special disk, memory and network solutions, too)\n- Parallelism simplified:\n   - You split a problem into smaller subtasks and solve them all simultaneously using numerous cores\n\n# First steps for fast jobs (1/2)\n\n- Spend a little time to investigate:\n   - Which of the available software would be the best to solve the kind of problem you have?\n      - Ask experienced colleagues or <servicedesk@csc.fi> for guidance\n- Consider:\n   - The software that solves your problem the fastest might not always be the best!\n      - Issues like ease-of-use and memory/disk demands are also highly relevant\n   - Start simple and gradually use more complex approaches if needed\n\n# First steps for fast jobs (2/2)\n\n- Check if your software of choice is available at CSC as a [pre-installed optimized version](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)\n   - Read both the official software manual (if available) and CSC's application page to understand how to run it efficiently\n- If you need to install Python packages through Conda, [we require you to containerize your environment](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/#conda-installations)\n   - Greatly improves performance at startup\n   - Easily accomplished using [Tykky container wrapper](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/)\n\n# Optimize the performance of your code (1/2)\n\n- When compiling a program, possibly one that you've written yourself, remember to use optimizing compiler flags\n   - Docs: Compiling on [Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/compiling-puhti/), [Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/compiling-mahti/) and [LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/)\n- Construct a small and quick test case and run it in the test queue\n   - Docs: Available partitions on [Puhti, Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/batch-job-partitions/) and [LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/partitions/)\n   - Use the test case to optimize computations before starting massive ones\n\n# Optimize the performance of your code (2/2)\n\n- Use profiling tools to understand how much time is spent in different parts of the code\n   - [Docs CSC: Performance analysis](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/performance/)\n   - [Docs LUMI: Profiling on LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/profiling/strategies/)\n- When the performance bottlenecks are identified, figure out ways to improve the code\n   - Again, [servicedesk@csc.fi](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi) is a channel to ask for help\n      - [The more concrete the problem is described, the better](https://docs.csc.fi/support/support-howto/)\n   - If your issue concerns LUMI, contact the [LUMI User Support Team](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/)\n\n# HPC parallel jobs\n\n- It is not just how your software is constructed and compiled that affects performance -- how it is parallelized and run are important factors, too!\n- **Recall:** a parallel job distributes the calculation over several cores in order to achieve a shorter wall-clock time\n  - Example batch job scripts for [Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/), [Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/example-job-scripts-mahti/), [LUMI-C](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumic-job/) and [LUMI-G](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumig-job/)\n  - **The best starting point:** [Software-specific batch scripts in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)\n\n# Parallel programming models\n\n- Parallel execution is based on *threads* or *processes* (or both) which run at the same time on different CPU cores\n- **Processes**\n  - Interaction is based on exchanging messages between processes\n    - Can form a performance bottleneck!\n  - MPI (Message Passing Interface)\n- **Threads**\n  - Shared memory, i.e. each thread can directly access data of other threads\n    - Easier to program, but problems may arise with *race conditions*, i.e. when different threads update same data without proper synchronization\n  - OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing)\n\n# MPI and OpenMP standards\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization responsible for providing IT solutions and services, including guidance on speeding up jobs through parallel programming and high-throughput computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE 4.0 UNPORTED LICENSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A license that allows for the sharing and adaptation of creative works, provided attribution is given and adaptations are shared under the same terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing resource mentioned in the context of compiling programs and optimizing performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing resource mentioned alongside Puhti for compiling programs and optimizing performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A supercomputer mentioned in the context of compiling, profiling, and running parallel jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool recommended for containerizing Python environments to improve performance at startup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MPI (MESSAGE PASSING INTERFACE)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A standard for communication between processes in a parallel computing environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP (OPEN MULTI-PROCESSING)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A standard for multi-threaded parallel programming in shared memory environments)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>Puhti is a computing resource provided or managed by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd for compiling and optimizing code<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>Mahti is a computing resource provided or managed by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd for compiling and optimizing code<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>LUMI is a supercomputer provided or managed by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd for compiling, profiling, and running parallel jobs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>Tykky Container Wrapper is recommended by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd for containerizing Python environments<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MPI (MESSAGE PASSING INTERFACE)<|>PARALLEL PROGRAMMING MODELS<|>MPI is a standard used in parallel programming models for process communication<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENMP (OPEN MULTI-PROCESSING)<|>PARALLEL PROGRAMMING MODELS<|>OpenMP is a standard used in parallel programming models for multi-threaded programming<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
