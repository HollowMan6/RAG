Warning \"For full node allocation only\"\n\n    This section of the documentation only applies if you have a full-node \n    allocation. This is the case if you submit to the `standard`, `standard-g`,\n    partitions. For other partitions, it will apply if you use the `--exclusive` \n    sbatch directive.\n\n    Similarly, binding cannot by applied for interactive jobs if you run `srun` \n    outside of an allocation, meaning you directly call `srun` on a login node.\n    You have to [create an allocation with `salloc`][interactive] first.\n\n## Background\n\n[distribution]: #distribution\n\n[srun]: https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html\n[numa]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access\n[lumi-c]: ../../hardware/lumic.md\n\nA compute node consists of a hierarchy of building blocks: one or more sockets\n(processors), consisting of multiple physical cores each with one or more\nlogical threads, enabling simultaneous multithreading.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/socket-core-threads.svg\" \n    width=\"700\"\n    alt=\"Concept of socket, core and threads\">\n  <figcaption>Concept of socket, core and threads</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFor example, each [LUMI-C][lumi-c] compute node contains 2 sockets. Each socket\nhas 64 physical cores and each core has 2 logical threads. This means that you\ncan launch up to 2 x 2 x 64 = 256 tasks (or threads) per node.\n\nA processor can also be partitioned in [Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)][numa]\ndomains. These domains divide the memory into multiple domains local to a group\nof cores. The memory in the local NUMA node can be accessed faster than the\nother NUMA nodes leading to better performance when a process/thread access\nmemory on the local NUMA node. LUMI-C uses 4 NUMA domains per socket (8 NUMA\ndomains per node). Thread migration from one core to another poses a problem\nfor a NUMA architecture by disconnecting a thread from its local memory\nallocations.\n\nFor the purpose of load balancing, the Linux scheduler will periodically migrate\nthe running processes. As a result, processes are moved between thread, core, or\nsocket within the compute node. However, the memory of a process doesn't\nnecessarily move at the same time leading to slower memory accesses.\n\nPinning (the binding of a process or thread to a specific core) can improve the\nperformance of your code by increasing the percentage of local memory accesses.\nOnce a process is pinned, it is bound to a specific set of cores and will only\nrun on the cores in this set, therefore preventing migration by the operating\nsystem.\n\n!!! warning \"Correct binding only for full node allocation\"\n\n    Binding only makes sense if your request a full node (user exclusive) \n    allocation. This is the default for the `standard`, `standard-g`, \n    partitions\n\n## Slurm binding options\n\nThis section describes options to control the way the process are pinned and\ndistributed both between the node and within the nodes when launching your\napplication with `srun`.\n\n### CPU binding\n\nTask (process) binding can be done via the `--cpu-bind=<bind>` option when\nlaunching your application with `srun` with `<bind>` the type of resource:\n\n- `threads` : tasks are pinned to the logical threads\n- `cores` : tasks are pinned to the cores\n- `sockets` : tasks are pinned to the sockets\n- `map_cpu:<list>` : custom bindings of tasks with `<list>` a comma-separated\n  list of CPUIDs\n- `mask_cpu:<list>` : custom bindings of tasks with `<list>` a comma-separated\n  mask of cores\n\n\n=== \"Threads\"\n\n    In this example, we have pinned the tasks to the threads.
