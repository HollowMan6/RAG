If the route is configured to provide TLS/HTTPS secure traffic, several options are available regarding the Route encryption:\n\n* **Edge**, this is the default and the simplest to configure. The Route provides the certificate, which is stored in the Route object itself. The traffic is decrypted and the Pod is contacted using plain text un-encrypted HTTPD traffic.\n* **Passthrough** is when the encryption is delegated to the pod, which must listen for TLS/HTTPS traffic and provide the certificate the client will receive.\n* **Re-encrypt**, this is a mixture of two previous options, the Route will provide a certificate, but it will connect to the Pod using TLS/HTTPS and expect a valid certificate for the domain name of the service. The client will still get the certificate stored by the Route. This is for example used when the internal network between nodes in the cluster is not considered secure enough and we still want the Route to control the certificates that the client will get. Also in some rare applications is not possible to disable TLS in the Pods.\n\n![Route Options](../img/route-modes.drawio.svg)\n\n!!! warning \"Re-encrypt\"\n    For Re-encrypt to work, it is necessary to provide your own certificate. There are 3 steps: (1) You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate is valid for the route host. (2) You may have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes the certificate chain. (3) You must have a separate destination CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file. If one of these steps is not followed correctly, the route will not work.\n\nA Route can also be configured to (1) provide a HTTP/302 redirection from port `80` to `443`. It is also possible to (2) serve the same content in both ports, or to (3) not serve anything at all in the un secure `80` port.\n\nAn important limitation for Rahti 2 is that **only the HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports are exposed for incoming traffic**, and they only can serve **HTTPD protocol requests**. Internally to a namespace, any port and protocol is supported, this means we can connect an application to a database with no issues, but we will never be able to expose that database to outside traffic. This is due to the fact that the same incoming virtual IP is shared with all the incoming traffic in Rahti 2's HAProxy load balancers. [Name-based virtual hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting#Name-based) are used to redirect the traffic to the correct Route. Other protocols that are not HTTPD, do not have this feature and will need a dedicated IP/port pair to work.\n\nRahti 2 provides a range of pre-created domain names, `XXXX.2.rahtiapp.fi` where `XXXX` can be any combination of letters, numbers and dashes. These pre-created domain names also come with a valid TLS certificate.\n\nEvery single pre-created domain name is configured to point to the HAProxy load balancers.\n\n### Custom domains\n\nAny existing possible domain name could potentially be used in Rahti, but the DNS configuration and the certificates must be managed by the customer:\n\n* For the DNS configuration, you need to configure a `CNAME` pointing to `router-default.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi` or in cases that this is not possible, another possibility is to configure an `A` record containing the IP of `router-default.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi` has to be configured. The way this needs to be configured depends on the register of the DNS record.\n\n    ```console\n    $ host ?????.??\n    ?????.?? is an alias for router-default.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi.\n    router-default.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi has address 195.148.21.61\n    ```\n\n* Any certificate provider can be used, like for example use the free certificates provided by the [Let's Encrypt controller](../tutorials/custom-domain.md#lets-encrypt).\n\nAnother aspect of routes is the IP white listing feature, ie: only allowing a range of IPs to access the route. This is controlled by creating an annotation in the Route object with the key `haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist`, and by setting the value to a space separated list of IPs and or IP ranges. Assuming variable `route_name` holds the name of the route\n\n* This first example will white list a range of IPs (`193.166.[0-255].[1-254]`):\n\n    ```bash\n    oc annotate route $route_name haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist='193.166.0.0/16'\n    ```\n\n* This other example will white list only a specific IP:\n\n    ```bash\n    oc annotate route $route_name haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist='188.184.9.236'\n    ```\n\n* And this example will combine both:\n\n    ```bash\n    oc annotate route $route_name haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist='193.166.0.0/15 193.167.189.25'\n    ```\n\n## Egress IPs\n\nThe IP for all outgoing customer traffic is `86.50.229.150`. Any pod that runs in Rahti 2 will use by default this IP to reach anything located outside Rahti 2 or a Route. It is possible, for selected namespaces that need it, to configure a dedicated IP. Each request is reviewed individually due to the fact that there is a limited pool of virtual IPs available.\n\n!!! warning \"Egress IP may change\"\n\n    The egress IP of Rahti 2 might change in the future.
