The biggest one is that virtual machines always have their own\nkernels, while containers share the host system's kernel.\n\n![The difference between virtual machines and containers](../img/vm_vs_container.png)\n*The difference between virtual machines and containers.*\n\nWhile many operating systems have the container functionality, what we look at more\nspecifically in this documentation is containers in the Linux operating system.\nLinux is the most popular operating system for running containers, and it is\nalso the operating system used in the Rahti 1 container cloud. Currently, the most\npopular method for using the container functionality in Linux is _Docker_. It provides\na set of tools that makes it easier to use containers compared to using the\nkernel functionality directly:\n\n  * A runtime (runC) for containers\n  * An image format for containers\n  * A command line interface for running and managing containers and images\n  * The Dockerfile format for building Docker images\n\nDocker has popularized containers by making them easier to use. Instead of\nlooking at kernel documentation and figuring out how to use the different\ninterfaces of the kernel's container features and then having to figure out\nwhich features you want to use and how, Docker provides a simpler way to start\ncontainers with a single command line command. The specific kernel features and\nhow to use them have been defined by Docker.\n\nAs an example of how Docker is used, this is how you could start a container on\nyour computer after installing Docker:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it ubuntu\n```\n\nThis will download the _ubuntu_ image if it is not already present on the\ncomputer, start a container based on that image, and give the user a command line\ninterface within the container. From the user's point of view, the experience is\nsimilar to starting a virtual machine: regardless of the operating system\ndistribution on your computer, interacting with the container seems like you\nare interacting with a Ubuntu installation.\n\nAfter running the command, you should be able to see the Ubuntu Docker image\nthat has been downloaded by listing the images:\n\n```bash\ndocker images\n```\n\nYou can also do many other things, such as launch containers in the background,\nattach to a running container to interact with it, or build your own Docker\nimages from a Dockerfile. The examples given here are intended to give a general\nidea of what using containers is like from the user's perspective. For more\ncomplete documentation about Docker, see the\n[official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).\n\n## Container orchestration\n\nTo understand why container orchestration platforms are important, let us\ndescribe how a typical web-based application that end users access via a web\nbrowser is built.\n\n![Container orchestration](../img/container-orch2.drawio.svg)\n\nThe application comprises a frontend that is the part of the application\nvisible to users and a backend that handles various tasks in the background such as\nstoring user data in a database. The application runs a server process that\nclients access to interact with the application. It also accesses a database\nsuch as PostgeSQL or MongoDB in the background to store user data.\n\nThe architects of this application must design it to keep the application\nrunning reliably, quickly and safely:\n\n  * Server hardware can fail, so the application must be replicated on multiple\n    physical servers so that the failure of an individual server will not render the\n    entire application inaccessible.\n  * A large number of users causes load on the application. It must be\n    possible to scale up the application by adding more application processes to\n    prepare for increased user load.\n  * The connection to the application must be secure so that the users can safely\n    enter their data in the application without fearing eavesdroppers.\n  * User data must be stored reliably on a fault-tolerant storage system.\n\nYou could create Linux virtual machines, install Docker on them, and run the\napplication directly using those, but there is a lot of additional work to meet\nall of the above requirements. You would have to figure\nout how to manage multiple instances of the application running on several\nservers, how to direct incoming traffic evenly to all the application instances,\nhow to store user data, and how to quickly add more capacity when needed.\n\nLuckily, most applications have similar requirements, so the steps for creating\ngood applications are often quite similar. This is where container orchestration\nsystems come in. They handle many of the common tasks required for running\nrobust web applications such as distributing application instances over multiple\nservers, directing traffic to the application instances, and providing persistent\nstorage for databases.\n\nCurrently, the most popular software for container orchestration is _Kubernetes_.\nIt is based on earlier systems developed at Google over a decade. The Rahti\nsystem is based on a distribution of Kubernetes called _OpenShift_ made by\nRed Hat.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is the most popular operating system for running containers, specifically mentioned in the context of the Rahti 1 container cloud.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 1 CONTAINER CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 1 container cloud uses the Linux operating system to run containers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kubernetes is the most popular software for container orchestration, handling tasks required for running robust web applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenShift is a distribution of Kubernetes made by Red Hat, on which the Rahti system is based.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED HAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red Hat is the company that makes OpenShift, a distribution of Kubernetes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER<|>LINUX<|>Docker is used on the Linux operating system for running containers, making it easier to use container functionality.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 1 CONTAINER CLOUD<|>LINUX<|>Rahti 1 container cloud operates on the Linux operating system.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>DOCKER<|>Kubernetes, used for container orchestration, can manage containers that are run using Docker.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>KUBERNETES<|>OpenShift is based on Kubernetes, indicating a direct relationship in technology and functionality.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>RED HAT<|>OpenShift is made by Red Hat, indicating a creator-product relationship.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
