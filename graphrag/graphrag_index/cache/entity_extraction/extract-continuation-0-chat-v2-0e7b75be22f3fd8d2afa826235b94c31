Many\nlibraries are provided both as single threaded and multithreaded\nversions, multithreaded modules are designated with `omp` in the\nmodule version. For pure MPI applications and applications calling\nlibraries from multiple threads it is recommended to use a single\nthreaded library.\n\nAvailibility of libraries may depend on the loaded compiler suite and\nMPI environment, use `module avail` for finding out available\nlibraries. See the documentation of library for\ninstructions on how to build against that particular library. Note\nthat most modules set `LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment\nvariables so that `-llibrary` linker flag is often enough. Most\nmodules set also `<library>_INSTALL_ROOT` environment variables that\ncan be utilized in custom build scripts. As an example, `fftw`\nlibrary can be used as follows:\n\n```bash\nmodule load fftw\n<compiler_command> -o myprog myprog.o -lfftw3\n```\n\nand the directory containing `include`, `lib`, *etc.* are found under\n`FFTW_INSTALL_ROOT` environment variable.\n\n## Libraries in Puhti\n\nSelected libraries available in Puhti:\n\n- Dense linear algebra: `intel-oneapi-mkl`\n- Dense distributed linear algebra: `intel-oneapi-mkl`, `netlib-scalapack`\n- Fast fourier transforms: `fftw`\n\n## Libraries in Mahti\n\nSelected libraries available in Mahti:\n\n- Dense linear algebra: `openblas`, `amdblis`, `amdlibflame`\n- Dense distributed linear algebra: `netlib-scalapack`, `amdscalapack`\n- Fast fourier transforms: `fftw`\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Designation for multithreaded modules in the module system, indicating support for OpenMP parallel programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the Message Passing Interface, a standard for parallel computing in distributed computing environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FFTW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library for computing fast Fourier transforms, available in both single-threaded and multithreaded versions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing environment where selected high performance libraries are available, including dense linear algebra and fast Fourier transforms libraries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Another computing environment distinct from Puhti, offering a selection of high performance libraries for dense linear algebra and fast Fourier transforms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEL-ONEAPI-MKL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library for dense linear algebra and dense distributed linear algebra available in Puhti\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETLIB-SCALAPACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library for dense distributed linear algebra available in both Puhti and Mahti\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENBLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library for dense linear algebra available in Mahti\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMDBLIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library for dense linear algebra available in Mahti\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMDLIBFLAME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library for dense linear algebra available in Mahti\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMDSCALAPACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library for dense distributed linear algebra available in Mahti\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FFTW<|>PUHTI<|>The FFTW library is available in the Puhti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FFTW<|>MAHTI<|>The FFTW library is also available in the Mahti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEL-ONEAPI-MKL<|>PUHTI<|>The Intel OneAPI MKL library is specifically available in Puhti for dense linear algebra and dense distributed linear algebra<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETLIB-SCALAPACK<|>PUHTI<|>Netlib-Scalapack is available in Puhti for dense distributed linear algebra<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETLIB-SCALAPACK<|>MAHTI<|>Netlib-Scalapack is also available in Mahti for dense distributed linear algebra<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENBLAS<|>MAHTI<|>OpenBLAS is available in Mahti for dense linear algebra<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMDBLIS<|>MAHTI<|>AMDBLIS is available in Mahti for dense linear algebra<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMDLIBFLAME<|>MAHTI<|>AMDLibFlame is available in Mahti for dense linear algebra<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMDSCALAPACK<|>MAHTI<|>AMDScalapack is available in Mahti for dense distributed linear algebra<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
