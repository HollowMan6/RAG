Since the `RSAGA` package is no longer actively maintained and has not been tested on newer SAGA GIS versions, we recommend using `Rsagacmd` with SAGA GIS 7.9.0 and higher. For more information on running R jobs on Puhti or using RStudio, please see the [`r-env` documentation](r-env.md).\n\nFor using SagaGIS, any of the modules listed about must be activated first, check the linked pages for details.\n\n\n### SAGA GIS command line interface \nSAGA GIS command line tools can be used in an [interactive session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) or [batch jobs](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\n#### SAGA GIS command line interface with r-env module\n\n`r-env` is an Apptainer container, which means the commands are slightly different compared to normal installations, basically all commands need to have `apptainer_wrapper exec` before the usual command.\n\nYou can test that SAGA GIS loaded successfully and print the command line tools help information with\n\n```\napptainer_wrapper exec saga_cmd -h\n```\n\n#### SAGA GIS command line interface with qgis module\n\nWith `qgis` module SagaGIS commands can be used normally, for example:\n\n```\nsaga_cmd -h\n```\n\n\n### SAGA GIS Graphical User Interface\n\n#### SAGA GIS Graphical User Interface in Puhti\n\nTo use SAGA GIS, open it in Puhti web interface:\n\n1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi).\n2. Open [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). \n3. After launching the Desktop, double-click SAGA GIS icon OR open `Terminal` (Desktop icon) and start SAGA GIS:\n\n```\nmodule load r-env\napptainer_wrapper exec saga_gui\n```\n\n#### SAGA GIS Graphical User Interface in LUMI\n\nUntil LUMI web interface is available, SagaGIS needs to be used with\n[SSH X11 forwarding](../computing/connecting/index.md#graphical-connection).\n\n```\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule load qgis\nsaga_gui\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nSAGA GIS is published under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) license. \n\n## Citation\n\n`Conrad, O., Bechtel, B., Bock, M., Dietrich, H., Fischer, E., Gerlitz, L., Wehberg, J., Wichmann, V., and Böhner, J.
