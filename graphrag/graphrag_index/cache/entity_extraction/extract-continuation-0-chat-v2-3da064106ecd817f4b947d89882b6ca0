It is a command-line tool for debugging\nCUDA programs.\n\nIn order to use tool the CUDA code has to be compiled with the extra flags\n`-g` and `-G`.\n\nNext in an [interactive session](running/interactive-usage.md) one needs to\nfirst load the CUDA module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load cuda\n```\n\nand then the debugging can be started by running:\n\n```bash\ncuda-gdb ./cuda_program\n```\n\nThe tool supports all options of [gdb](gdb.md) and some extra commands\nspecific to CUDA debugging:\n\n* Info commands: Commands to query information about CUDA activities\n* Focus Commands: Commands to query or switch the focus of the debugger\n* Configuration Commands: Commands to configure the CUDA-specific commands\n\nOut of bonds accesses can be checked inside the debugger by activating\nthe memory checker with `set cuda memcheck on`. Alternatively the `cuda-memcheck` or [`compute-sanitizer`](compute-san.md)\ntool can be used outside of the debugger (`cuda-memcheck ./cuda_program` or `compute-sanitizer ./cuda_program`).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CUDA-GDB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CUDA-gdb is an NVIDIA extension of the GNU debugger for debugging CUDA programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NVIDIA is the company that developed CUDA-gdb, an extension of the GNU debugger gdb for CUDA program debugging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU DEBUGGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The GNU Debugger, gdb, is a command-line tool for debugging programs, which CUDA-gdb extends for CUDA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment where CUDA-gdb version 10.2 is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a computing environment where CUDA-gdb version 10.1 is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUDA-MEMCHECK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CUDA-memcheck is a tool for checking memory errors in CUDA programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTE-SANITIZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Compute-sanitizer is a tool for detecting memory errors and other types of errors in CUDA programs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUDA-GDB<|>NVIDIA<|>CUDA-gdb was developed by NVIDIA as an extension of the GNU debugger for CUDA<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUDA-GDB<|>GNU DEBUGGER<|>CUDA-gdb is an extension of the GNU debugger, gdb, specifically for CUDA programs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUDA-GDB<|>CUDA<|>CUDA-gdb is a tool for debugging programs developed with NVIDIA's CUDA<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUDA-GDB<|>PUHTI<|>CUDA-gdb version 10.2 is available on Puhti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUDA-GDB<|>MAHTI<|>CUDA-gdb version 10.1 is available on Mahti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUDA-MEMCHECK<|>CUDA<|>CUDA-memcheck is a tool used for checking memory errors in programs developed with CUDA<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPUTE-SANITIZER<|>CUDA<|>Compute-sanitizer is a tool for detecting various errors in CUDA programs<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
