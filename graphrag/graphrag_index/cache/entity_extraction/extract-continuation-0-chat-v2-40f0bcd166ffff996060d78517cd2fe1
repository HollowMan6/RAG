[List of pre-installed softwares](./sd-desktop-software.md#default-software-selection-in-sd-desktop).\n\n* **Delete or pause unused desktops**: Ensure to [delete](./sd-desktop-manage.md#deleting-a-desktop) or [pause](./sd-desktop-manage.md#pausing-or-unpausing-a-virtual-desktop) your desktop when not in use. Unused desktops trigger email notifications after 14 days of inactivity.\n\n* Additional volume or disk space can only be requested by writing to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Sensitive data).\n  \n* **You can detach and attach a volume from your virtual desktop** on the SD Desktop Management page. This can be compared to connecting/disconnecting a hard drive to your laptop. This feature is available only on desktops created after February 2023. For additional details, refer to: [Managing volume and desktops](./sd-desktop-manage.md).\n\n\n!!! info \"Need assistance?\"\n    If you're uncertain about which desktop to choose or need support for your research, contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) with the subject \"Sensitive data\".\n\n\n\nRead next:\n\n* [How to work with your virtual desktop](./sd-desktop-access.md)\n* [Which software is available for virtual desktop](./sd-desktop-software.md)\n* [How to manage your virtual desktop (delete, pause, detach volume etc.)](./sd-desktop-manage.md)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create virtual desktops\n\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"155\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6xXKPTB6H0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCreating a virtual desktop is easy and doesn't require technical expertise. \n\n* first [log in](./sd-desktop-login.md)\n* click on *Go to SD Desktop Management* [(See screenshot)](images/desktop/SD-Desktop_GoToManagement.png){ target=\"_blank\" }\n* and follow these steps:\n\n## 1.
