All-in-one processing engine with CLI for EO image archives. [FORCE example for Puhti](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/force)\n\n[**GDAL (OGR)**](../../../apps/gdal.md) - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. Collection of command-line tools for accessing and transforming geospatial data. It is relatively fast and requires little computational resources. GDAL supports reading data directly from the Internet or object storage. GDAL is included in many other tools for data reading and writing. [GDAL example for Puhti](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/gdal)\n\n[**Julia**](../../../apps/julia.md) - Puhtis Julia installation does not include any geospatial packages, but they can be installed by the user. [JuliaGeo](https://github.com/JuliaGeo) provides an overview of packages for geospatial data.\n\n[**Matlab**](../../../apps/matlab.md) - you can run Matlab jobs on Puhti conveniently from your own computers Matlab installation.\n\n[**Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)**](../../../apps/otb.md) - offers a wide variety of applications from ortho-rectification or pansharpening, all the way to classification, SAR processing, and much more. Orfeo Toolbox is available as CLI, GUI and via Python interface.\n\n[**Python**](../../../apps/python.md)\n\n* The [geoconda module](../../../apps/geoconda.md) provides many useful Python packages for raster data processing and analysis, such as `rasterio`, `rasterstats`, `scimage`, `sentinelhub`, `xarray`, `boto3` and packages for working with STAC.\n* [Machine learning modules](../../../apps/by_discipline.md#data-analytics-and-machine-learning) provide some common machine learning frameworks, inc. for deep learning..\n\n[**QGIS**](../../../apps/qgis.md) - open source tool with GUI for working with spatial data including limited multispectral image processing capabilities.  GUI with batch processing possibility and Python interface. Used for example for visualization, map algebra and other raster processing. Many plug-ins available, for EO data processing, check out the [QGIS Semi-automatic classification plugin](https://fromgistors.blogspot.com/p/semi-automatic-classification-plugin.html).\n\n[**R**](../../../apps/r-env-for-gis.md) - Puhti R installation includes a lot of geospatial packages, including several useful for EO data processing, such as `terra`, `CAST`, `raster`, `rstac` and `spacetime`.\n\n[**Sen2Cor**](../../../apps/sen2cor.md) - a command-line tool for Sentinel-2 Level 2A product generation and formatting.\n\n[**Sen2mosaic**](../../../apps/sen2cor.md) - a command-line tool to download, preprocess and mosaic Sentinel-2 data.\n\n[**SNAP**](../../../apps/snap.md) - ESA Sentinel Application Platform. Tool for processing of Sentinel data (+ support for other data sources). GUI, CLI (Graph Processing Tool, GPT) and Python interfaces. [SNAP GPT example for Puhti](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/snap).\n\n[**allas'']](../../../apps/allas.md) - tools for working with S3 storage, inc CSC Allas, CDSE S3 etc: `rclone` and `s3cmd`.\n\nIf you need further applications, you can ask CSC to install them for you. \n \n### Machine Learning with EO data\n\nOne example of the advanced usage of EO data is for machine learning. If you are interested in the topic, you can find a lot of examples from [CSC machine learning with spatial data course materials]( https://github.com/csc-training/GeoML). For practical guidelines, see also [CSC machine learning guide](../ml-guide.md)\n\n## Alternative processing services\n\nBelow is a list of alternative EO processing services that might be useful, when a lot of data is required and downloading it all to CSC might not be feasible. \n\n**[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)** is a processing platform, which requires registration, but is currently free of charge for research users. It can be accessed via browser and has worldwide analysis ready data available (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/\" aria-label=\"GEE data catalog\">browse the catalog</a>). In general, JavaScript is used on the platform, but also  <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install\" aria-label=\"Python on GEE\">Python</a>  and  <a href=\"https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee\" aria-label=\"R on GEE\">R</a> support exists. Check out [GEE's tutorials](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials). Note that Google Cloud Storage might be needed to export large datasets.\n\n**[Microsoft planetary computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com)** offers JupyterHub together with Dask Gateway, both CPUs and GPUs are available. It is currently available in preview.\n\n[**CDSE**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse) provides also processing services, mainly via [**OpenEO**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/apis/openeo-api) and [**SentinelHub**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/apis/sent\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
