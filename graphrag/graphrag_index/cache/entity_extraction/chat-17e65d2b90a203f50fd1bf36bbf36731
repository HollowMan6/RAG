Case 3: Use a custom bucket name (replace `<project number>` with your project number, e.g. 2001234):\n\n```bash\na-put pythium/* -b <project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\na-list <project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Can you see the difference between the three `a-put` commands above?\n6. Study the `<project number>-$USER-genomes-ap` bucket with commands:\n\n```bash\na-list <project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\nrclone ls allas:<project number>-$USER-genomes-ap \n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 6\"}\n7. Why do the two commands above list a different amount of objects?\n8. Try the command (replace `<project number>` with your project number, e.g. 2001234):\n\n```bash\na-info <project number>-$USER-genomes-ap/pythium_vexans.tar\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 8\"}\n9. This command is actually the same as:\n\n```bash\nrclone cat allas:<project number>-$USER-genomes-ap/pythium_vexans.tar_ameta\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 9\"}\n10. Finally, try the command:\n\n```bash\na-flip pythium/pythium_vexans/pythium_vexans.fasta \n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 10\"}\n11. Try opening the public link that `a-flip` produced with your browser\n\n### Upload case 3: `allas-backup`\n\n1. Run the commands:\n\n```test\nallas-backup -help\nallas-backup pythium\nallas-backup list\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. What did these commands do to your data?\n\n## 4. Exit\n\n1. The data in the `pythium` directory is now stored in many ways in Allas, so we can remove the data from Puhti and log out:\n\n```bash\nrm -r pythium\nexit\n```\n\n## 5. Downloading data from Allas to Puhti\n\n1. Login to Puhti and move to your personal directory in your project's `/scratch`:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi   # replace <username> with your CSC username\ncd /scratch/<project>/$USER   # replace `<project>` with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. In Puhti, check you projects with the command:\n\n```bash\ncsc-workspaces\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Set up the Allas connection:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf \n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Then run the commands (we will use the same bucket that was created earlier):\n\n```bash\na-list\nrclone lsd allas:\n# replace <project number> with your project number, e.g. 2001234\na-list <project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\nrclone ls allas:<project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\na-find pythium_vexans.fasta\na-find -a pythium_vexans.fasta\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Next, download the data in different ways:\n\n### 1. Download with `rclone`\n\n```bash\nmkdir rclone_dir\ncd rclone_dir/\n```\n\n1. Copy everything:\n\n```bash\nmkdir all\nrclone ls allas:<project number>-$USER-genomes-ap\nrclone copyto -P allas:<project number>-$USER-genomes-ap all/\nls all\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Copy a set of objects:\n\n```bash\nmkdir vexans \nrclone copyto allas:$USER-genomes-rc/pythium_vexans vexans/\nls vexans\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Copy just one object:\n\n```bash\nrclone copyto allas:$USER-genomes-rc/pythium_vexans/pythium_vexans.fasta ./vexans.fasta\nls\n```\n\n## 2. Download with `a-get`\n\n1. Return to your `$USER` directory under your project's `/scratch` on Puhti (The `pwd` command should print `/scratch/<project/$USER`):\n\n```bash\ncd ..\npwd\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Make a new directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir a_dir\ncd a_dir/\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Create a directory `all` and move there:\n\n```bash\nmkdir all\ncd all\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. List your default `SCRATCH` bucket (replace `<project number>` with your project number, e.g. 2001234):\n\n```bash\na-list <project number>-puhti-SCRATCH\na-list <project number>-puhti-SCRATCH/$USER\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Look for the file `pythium_vexans.fasta` in your Puhti `SCRATCH` bucket:\n\n```bash\na-find py\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
