Due to small usage and the availability of\noverlapping tools ([Maestro](../../apps/maestro.md)), the license will not be continued after this\nyear. This means that in 2023 these molecular modeling tools can't be used any more at CSC nor on\nusers' own computers. Please contact [Service Desk](../contact.md) if you need help in moving your\nmolecular modeling work to other modeling environments.\n\n## PyTorch 1.12, 8.7.2022\n\nPyTorch 1.12.0 is now available in the `pytorch/1.12` module on Puhti\nand Mahti. See the [official PyTorch 1.12 release\nnotes](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.12-released/), and [CSC's\nPyTorch module documentation](../../apps/pytorch.md).\n\n## CP2K modules on Mahti recompiled, 5.7.2022\n\nDue to an issue related to OpenBLAS, the CP2K modules on Mahti have been\nrecompiled and linked to another linear algebra library (AMD BLIS). The old\nversions were in some cases using up to seven times as much memory as before,\nwhile matrix diagonalizations were not benefiting from the ELPA library as\nexpected.\n\n## Python Data 3.9-3 and RAPIDS 22.04, 5.5.2022\n\nNew versions of [Python Data](../../apps/python-data.md) and\n[RAPIDS](../../apps/rapids.md) are now available on both Puhti and Mahti. The\ndefault versions have been changed to these new versions.\n\n## CP2K 9.1 linked to Gromacs 2022, 19.4.2022\n\n[CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md) 9.1 has been linked to [Gromacs](../../apps/gromacs.md) 2022 for QM/MM\nin the module `gromacs-env/2022-cp2k` on Mahti. This option was previously available under the\nCP2K module `cp2k/8.1-gmx`, which has now been deprecated. Please use `gromacs-env/2022-cp2k` for\nQM/MM simulations from now on.\n\n## PyTorch 1.11, 8.4.2022\n\nPyTorch 1.11.0 is now available in the `pytorch/1.11` module on Puhti and Mahti,\nand has been set as the default module. See the [official PyTorch 1.11 release\nnotes](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.11-released/), and [CSC's PyTorch\nmodule documentation](../../apps/pytorch.md).\n\n## LUE released on Puhti, 5.4.2022\n\nAn approximate tool called [LUE](../tutorials/lue.md) (Lustre Usage Explorer) for reporting amount\nof data in folders has been released on Puhti. LUE is significantly faster than standard tools like\n`stat` or `du` while being nicer on the file system. Please use LUE to keep track of how much\ndata/files you have on the disk and perform clean-ups in a timely manner to ensure a more\nperformant filesystem for all users.\n\n## Tykky 0.2.2, 31.3.2022\n\n[Tykky](../../computing/containers/tykky.md), a brand new tool for wrapping Conda/pip environments\ninside a Singularity container, has been released. Containerization will considerably improve\nstartup times and decrease IO load with less files on the shared parallel filesystem. We recommend\nwrapping all existing Conda environments within containers using Tykky as the [direct usage of\nConda on CSC supercomputers has been deprecated](../tutorials/conda.md).\n\n## TensorFlow 2.8, 17.3.2022\n\nTensorFlow 2.8.0 is now available in the `tensorflow/2.8` module on Puhti and\nMahti, and has been set as the default module. See the [TensorFlow 2.8 release\nnotes on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.8.0/)\nfor more details.\n\n## Gromacs 2022, 9.3.2022\n\n[Gromacs 2022](../../apps/gromacs.md) has been installed on Puhti and Mahti and is available on\nboth systems with `module load gromacs-env/2022`. A list of new features and changes is found in the\n[Gromacs manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/release-notes/index.html#gromacs-2022-series).\n`gromacs-env/2021` is now the default.\n\n## CP2K 9.1, 4.3.2022\n\n[CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md) version 9.1 has been installed on Mahti and is available with\n`module load cp2k/9.1-omp`, given that `gcc/10.3.0` and `openmpi/4.1.0` are first loaded.\nA list of new features and changes is found on the [CP2K website](https://www.cp2k.org\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
