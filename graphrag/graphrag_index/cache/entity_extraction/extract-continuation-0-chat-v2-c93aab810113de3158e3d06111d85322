The simulation consists of 24 iterations where the ethanol\nmolecule is gradually pulled closer to the surface. These 24 iterations are all\nrun concurrently using 5 MPI tasks each, which is specified in the batch script\nas `-partition 24x5`. The number of processors must add up to the amount\nrequested, in this case 3 full Puhti nodes (120 cores). In general, the\npartitions do not have to be of equal size, but one could for example specify\n`-partition 3x30 20 10` for 3 partitions of 30 cores, one of 20 cores and one\nof 10 cores (3 Puhti nodes). This does of course not make sense for jobs where\nthe subtasks are virtually identical, such as here.\n\nIf the `-partition` switch is used one needs to replace the usual `index` and\n`loop` variable styles used in the input of sequential simulations. The\ncorresponding styles compatible with multi-partition jobs are `world`,\n`universe` and `uloop`. For further details, see the LAMMPS documentation on\n[running multiple simulations from one input script](https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_multiple.html),\nthe [partition switch](https://docs.lammps.org/Run_options.html#partition) and\n[variable styles compatible with multi-partition jobs](https://docs.lammps.org/variable.html).\n\nA batch script for running the same system by sharing a single LUMI GCD (half\na GPU) among all 24 replicas could look like:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --partition=small-g\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1\n\nmodule load PrgEnv-amd craype-x86-trento craype-accel-amd-gfx90a rocm cray-fftw\n\nexport PATH=\"/path/to/your/lammps/installation/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\nexport OMP_PROC_BIND=spread\nexport OMP_PLACES=threads\n\nsrun lmp -in loop.lammps -k on g 1 -sf kk -pk kokkos -partition 24x1\n```\n\n## References\n\nThe following CPC paper is the canonical reference to use for citing LAMMPS.
