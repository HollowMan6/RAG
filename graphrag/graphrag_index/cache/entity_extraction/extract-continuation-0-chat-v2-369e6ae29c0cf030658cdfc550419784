The selected examples shown below would serve as recipe for building your own customised singularity jobs.  \n\n   - [DeepVariant pipeline](#deepvariant-pipeline)\n   - ...\n\n### DeepVariant pipeline  ###\n\nDeepVariant pipeline (Poplin et al., Nature biotechnology, 2018) is used  to perform variant calling on WGS and WES data sets. More information about the deepvariant programmes can be found [here](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) \n\nOne needs to get DeepVariant docker image, models and test data in order to run the pipeline. Additionally, other prerequisites for running deepvariant method includes 1) obtaining a reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) format and its corresponding index file (.fai). 2) An aligned reads file in [BAM](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) format and its corresponding index file (.bai).\n\n#### Convert docker image into Singularity image on your local machine ####\n\nOne way to build a Singularity image is to download the deepvariant docker image to local registry and then convert it to singularity one to avoid any possible erros with docker images pulled directly with singularity build command from google registry. Please note that one has to do these image conversions in your local machine or virtual machine in cPouta as Puhti does not grant root access to users.\n\nPull DeepVariant image and push it into local registry as below:\n\n```\nsudo docker pull gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:0.8.0\nsudo docker tag gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:0.8.0 localhost:5000/deepvariant:latest\nsudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2\nsudo docker push localhost:5000/deepvariant:latest\n```\n\nthen create a definition file (deffile) as follows:\n\n```\nBootstrap: docker\nRegistry: http://localhost:5000\nNamespace:\nFrom:deepvariant:latest\n```\nand finally create a Singularity image as below:\n\n```\nsudo SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS=1 singularity build deepvariant.simg  deffile\n```\nAlternatively, one can download  pre-converted singularity images (both cpu and gpu versions) along with test data from CSC's [Allas](../../data/Allas/index.md) object storage as below:\n\n```\nwget https://a3s.fi/pilot_projects/Deepvariant_singularity.zip\n```\n\n\n### Prepare a batch script to run deepvariant pipeline on Puhti (file: deepvariant_puhti.sh)\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --account=project_xxx\n\nexport TMPDIR=$PWD \n\nsingularity -s exec -B $PWD:/data  \\\ndeepvariant.simg \\\n/opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant \\\n--model_type=WGS \\\n--ref=/data/testdata/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta \\\n--reads=/data/testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam \\\n--regions \"chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000\" \\\n--output_vcf=output.vcf.gz  \\\n--output_gvcf=output.g.vcf.gz\n```\n\n### Submit job using sbatch command\n\n```\nsbatch  deepvariant_puhti.sh\n```\n\nPlease **note** that one can use gpu version of deepvariant with the following sbatch script \n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --partition=gputest\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1\n#SBATCH --account=project_xxx\n\nexport TMPDIR=$PWD\n\nsingularity -s exec --nv -B $PWD:/data \\\ndeepvariant_gpu.simg \\\n/opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant \\\n--model_type=WGS \\\n--ref=/data/testdata/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta \\\n--reads=/data/testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam  \\\n--regions \"chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000\" \\\n--output_vcf=output.vcf.gz  \\\n--output_gvcf=output.g.vcf.gz\n```\n### Deepvariant as an interactive job in Puhti\nOne can run singularity containers also in the [interactive](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) mode.\nFor example, deepvariant can be run as follows: \n\nDownload and unzip the deepvariant folder with data and singularity images in the login node\n```\n wget https://a3s.fi/pilot_projects/Deepvariant_singularity.zip   \n unzip Deepvariant_singularity.zip\n```\nThen start interactive shell and provide requested parameters as prompted in terminal\n```\nsinteractive -i\n```\nStart interactive singularity session\n```\ncd Deepvariant_singularity\nexport TMPDIR=$PWD\nsingularity shell -B $PWD:/data deepvariant.simg\n```\nExecute the actual workflow commands in the singularity session\n\n```\nexport PATH=/opt/deepvariant/bin:$PATH\ncd /data/testdata/\nrun_deepvariant --model_type=WGS --ref=ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta --reads=NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam --regions \"chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000\" --output_vcf=output.vcf.gz --output\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SINGULARITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Singularity is a container platform used to run applications in an isolated environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI SUPERCOMPUTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti Supercomputer is a high-performance computing system used for running complex computational tasks, including bio-applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEPVARIANT PIPELINE<|>EVENT<|>DeepVariant pipeline is a process developed by Poplin et al., for variant calling on WGS and WES data sets, utilizing machine learning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC'S ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC's Allas is an object storage service provided by CSC for storing and sharing large amounts of data)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGULARITY<|>PUHTI SUPERCOMPUTER<|>Singularity containers are used to run bio-applications on the Puhti Supercomputer<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPVARIANT PIPELINE<|>DOCKER<|>DeepVariant pipeline utilizes Docker images for setting up the computational environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPVARIANT PIPELINE<|>CSC'S ALLAS<|>Pre-converted Singularity images for DeepVariant, along with test data, can be downloaded from CSC's Allas<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
