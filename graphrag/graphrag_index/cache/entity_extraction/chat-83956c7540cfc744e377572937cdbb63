The new user interface offers an easy way for new users to use Puhti, and for experienced users it makes access to some features quicker and easier. See [web interface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md) for details\n\n## MPICH modules no longer work 4.5.2021 \n\nAs a consequence of the major network stack update done on Puhti during the service break, the MPICH installations on Puhti no longer work correctly and can not be easily fixed. Old versions of MPICH were installed as a last-resort option and they were using a communication library that has now been deprecated by the vendor. We advice you to recompile your software using either hpcx-mpi or intel-mpi. Please let us know if for some reason you can not at all work with either of the above mentioned mpi libraries.\n\nMPICH version 3.4 with UCX support is going to be installed on Puhti later, but this will take some time.\n\n## Slurm update and srun & behavior 4.5.2021\n\nRunning `srun prog &` on Puhti  will produce errors like  \"step creation still disabled, retrying (Requested nodes are busy)\" if `SLURM_EXACT=1` or `SLURM_OVERLAP=1` is not set. See <https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html> for details\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
