The application you want to run does not have a docker image available, or there is an image available, but it is not working on OpenShift. Due to the fact that OpenShift is designed to be a shared cluster, where users from different teams will run applications in the same hardware, OpenShift has to add limitations and runs things differently than in a standard Kubernetes cluster.\n\nRahti 2's registry has an image size limit of 5GB. The bigger is an image, the worse the experience is to work with it. It takes more time to pull, and it fills up the image's cache of the node faster. An image more than 1GB is already considered a very big image. See the article about [keeping docker images small](keeping_docker_images_small.md)\n\n## Building images locally\n\nIn this example we are going to use the [official nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) built over the [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) distribution, and make the necessary changes to make it work in OpenShift.\n\nThree steps are needed to run build an image locally in a computer.\n\n* First a `Dockerfile` must be written, for example this:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM nginx:alpine\n\n# support running as arbitrary user which belongs to the root group\nRUN chmod g+rwx /var/cache/nginx /var/run /var/log/nginx && \\\n    chown nginx.root /var/cache/nginx /var/run /var/log/nginx && \\\n    # users are not allowed to listen on privileged ports\n    sed -i.bak 's/listen\\(.*\\)80;/listen 8081;/' /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && \\\n    # Make /etc/nginx/html/ available to use\n    mkdir -p /etc/nginx/html/ && chmod 777 /etc/nginx/html/ && \\\n    # comment user directive as master process is run as user in OpenShift anyhow\n    sed -i.bak 's/^user/#user/' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nWORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html/\nEXPOSE 8081\n\nUSER nginx:root\n```\n\nThe `Dockerfile` is:\n\n 1. Giving write permissions to the `root` group (not the `root` user) to several folders that nginx needs to write to (/var/cache/nginx, /var/run, /var/log/nginx, and /etc/nginx/html/). Applications are run using a random user and the `root` group.\n 2. Changing the port where nginx listens to, as only root is allowed to listen on privileged ports (<1024).\n 3. And finally comment out the `user` configuration directive.\n\n The original `nginx:alpine` image has 5 layers, and we will adding a new one (`RUN`).\n\nA simpler example of `Dockerfile` could be:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM alpine\n\nRUN apk add git\n```\n\nThis is just installing git over `alpine`, and add also a new layer.\n\nSee the [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) reference docs.\n\nThen, the following command must be used to build the image `docker.io/user/name:tag`:\n\n```bash\ndocker build . -t docker.io/user/name:tag\n```\n\nAnd finally, to publish the image:\n\n```bash\ndocker push docker.io/user/name:tag\n```\n\n## Using Rahti 2 to build container images\n\nThe methods below use Rahti 2 to build the images.\n\n### Using a local folder for building\n\nThis method allows to build an image using a local folder containing a Dockerfile and the other required project files. It is useful when it is not possible or inconvenient to allow Rahti 2 to clone a repository directly.\n\nThis assumes that you have authorized a Rahti 2 command line session and created\na project in Rahti 2. Instructions for that are shown in Chapter [Command line\ntool usage](../usage/cli.md#cli-cheat-sheet).\n\n**Steps:**\n\nCreate Rahti 2 specific definitions with `oc new-build` command. Be sure\nnot to be in a directory under git version control:\n\n```bash\n$ oc new-build --to=my-hello-image:devel --name=my-hello --binary\n    * A Docker build using binary input will be created\n      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag \"my-hello-image:devel\"\n      * A binary build was created, use 'start-build --from-dir' to trigger a new build\n\n--> Creating resources with label build=my-hello ...\n    imagestream.image.openshift.io \"my-hello-image\" created\n    buildconfig.build.openshift.io \"my-hello\" created\n--> Success\n```\n\nThen you need a `Dockerfile`, you can use any of the previous `Dockerfile` in the previous example, or any other one you may have around. In order to tell OpenShift to build the image, just `cd` to the folder where the `Dockerfile` is, and start build with the `oc start-build` command, it will take any file in the current directory and output the build process to local terminal:\n\n```bash\noc start-build my-hello --from-dir=./ -F\n```\n\nThe image will be visible to internet at\n`image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi/<project-name>/my-hello-image:devel` for docker\ncompatible clients but you will first need to authenticate in order to pull it. \n\nFor command-line usage with docker compatible clients, the docker repository password will be the access token shown when authorizing Rahti 2 command line session and user name can be `unused`.\n\n```sh\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenShift is a family of containerization software developed by Red Hat.
