It is able to use both the S3 and Swift protocols (and many others). At the moment, the Swift protocol is the default option on the CSC servers. \n\n> **WARNING:** Rclone should not be used to copy, move or rename objects **inside** Allas. Rclone provides commands for these operations but they don't work correctly for files larger than 5 GB.\n> \n> **WARNING:** If a rclone data upload process for a over 5 GB file gets interrupted, please remove the partially uploaded object before restarting the upload process. Otherwise rclone sometimes reports a successful data upload even though not all data has been copied to Allas.\n\n\n\nThe basic syntax of Rclone:\n<pre>\nrclone <i>subcommand options source:path dest:path</i> \n</pre>\n\nThe most frequently used Rclone commands:\n\n*    [rclone copy]( https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) – Copy files from the source to the destination, skipping what has already been copied.\n*    [rclone sync](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) – Make the source and destination identical, modifying only the destination.\n*    [rclone move](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/) – Move files from the source to the destination.\n*    [rclone delete](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/) – Remove the contents of a path.\n*    [rclone mkdir](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mkdir/) – Create the path if it does not already exist.\n*    [rclone rmdir](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/) – Remove the path.\n*    [rclone check](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) – Check if the files in the source and destination match.\n*    [rclone ls](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ls/) – List all objects in the path, including size and path.\n*    [rclone lsd](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsd/) – List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.\n*    [rclone lsl](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsl/) – List all objects in the path, including size, modification time and path.\n*    [rclone lsf](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/) – List the objects using the virtual directory structure based on the object names.\n*    [rclone cat](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cat) – Concatenate files and send them to stdout.\n*    [rclone copyto](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyto/) – Copy files from the source to the destination, skipping what has already been copied.\n*    [rclone moveto](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/) – Move the file or directory from the source to the destination.\n*    [rclone copyurl](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyurl/) – Copy the URL's content to the destination without saving it in the tmp storage.\n\nA more extensive list can be found on the [Rclone manual pages](https://rclone.org/docs/) or by typing the command `rclone` in Puhti.\n\n## Authentication \n\nThe first step is to authenticate to a project in Allas. Rclone can use both Swift and S3 protocols but these connections will have different names in rclone commands. \n\nIn this document we describe how Rclone is used in CSC computing environment (Puhti and Mahti). You can use rclone also in your local computer. Instructions of configuring locally installed Rclone are here\n\n   * [Local Rclone configuration for Allas](./rclone_local.md)\n\n\n### Rclone with swift on CSC supercomputers\n\nThe default protocol of Allas is Swift. In Puhti and Mahti Swift based Allas connection is activated  with commands:\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf\n```\nThe `allas-conf` command asks for your CSC password (University/Haka password will not work here). It lists\nyour projects in Allas and asks you to define the project that will be used. Then _allas-conf_ generates a Rclone configuration file for the Allas service and authenticates the connection to the selected project. In Rclone command this swift based connection is referred with remote name `allas:`. The authentication information is stored in the shell variables `OS_AUTH_TOKEN` and `OS_STORAGE_URL` that are valid for up to eight hours. However, you can refresh the authentication at any time by running _allas-conf_ again. The environment variables are available only for that login session, so if you login to Puhti in another session, you need to authenticate again to access Allas.\n\n### Rclone with S3 on CSC supercomputers\n\nIf you want to use Allas with the S3 protocol instead, run the `allas-conf` command with the `--mode S3` option.\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf --mode S3\n```\nThis command opens permanent S3 based connection to Allas. Rclone can now refer to this connection with remote name `s3allas:`.\nIn the examples below the swift based `allas:` remote definition is used, but if you have S3 connection defined, you could replace it\nwith `s3allas:`. Note that you can have both `allas:` and `s3allas:` functional in the same time and that they can still use different\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
