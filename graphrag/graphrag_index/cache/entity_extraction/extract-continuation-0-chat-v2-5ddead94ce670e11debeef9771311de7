This is achieved by providing `pat_build` with a\n`build-options.apa` file generated with `pat_report` from a previous sampling\nrun.\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build -O <pertools-out-dir>/build-options.apa\n```\n\nThis will build a new executable whose name ends with `+apa`. You can then run\nthis executable to get tracing data and generate a report with `pat_report`.\n\n#### Manual analysis\n\nIf the automatic program analysis is not sufficient, you have to manually\nchoose your profiling setup. The tracing of the entire program is made possible\nby using the `-w` option when building your application with `pat_build`\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build -w app.x\n```\n\nAnother possibility is to select the function belonging to a particular trace\nfunction group. For example, for the MPI group functions\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build -g mpi app.x\n```\n\nwhere the `-g` option is used to select a trace group. There is support for a\nwide variety of predefined function groups. A full list can be obtained from\nthe `pat_build` manpage.\n\nUser-defined function can be traced with the `-T` option and provide a list of\nfunction names, or use the `-t` option and provide a file listing the functions\nto trace.\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build -w -T func1,func2 app.x\n$ pat_build -w -t tracefile app.x\n```\n\nBe careful when you specify the name of the function as the compiler may have\naltered the name. For example, an underscore character may have been added to\nthe Fortran routine. You can use `nm <app>` or `readelf -s <app>` to read the\nsymbol table of your application. In addition, you can choose to trace all the\nuser-defined function, with the `-u` option.\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build -u app.x\n```\n\nOf course, you can combine the option presented above to match your needs. For\nexample, you can choose to trace the MPI and OpenMP group and all the\nuser-defined functions.\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build -g mpi,omp -u app.x\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAT_BUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used for building new executables and enabling tracing in applications for performance analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAT_REPORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used to generate reports from tracing data collected by pat_build during application runs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAT_BUILD<|>PAT_REPORT<|>pat_build uses a build-options.apa file generated by pat_report for creating a new executable<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
