Gaussian is available for use by\nall approved account holders, subject to some license restrictions. To be able to use\nGaussian at CSC **your user-id has to be added to Gaussian users group. Send a request to\n[CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).**\n\n## Usage\n\nInitialize the Gaussian environment:\n\n```bash\nmodule load gaussian/G16RevC.02\n```\n\nStandard jobs are then conveniently submitted by using the `subg16` script:\n\n```bash\nsubg16 time jobname <billing project id>\n```\n\nRun the plain subg16 command for details.\n\nFor optimal performance of Gaussian jobs on CSC's servers it is beneficial to make some\nefficiency considerations. Some hints on how to estimate memory and disk requirements can\nbe found [here](http://gaussian.com/running/?tabid=3).\n\n### Using local disk on Puhti\n\nParticularly some wave function-based electron correlation methods can\nbe very disk I/O intensive. Such jobs benefit from using the fast\n[NMVE local disk](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/#local-storage)\non Puhti. Using local disk for such jobs will also reduce the overall load on the\nLustre parallel file system.\n\nOn Puhti, you can request your Gaussian job to use local disk by submitting the\njob with the `subg16_nvme` script:\n\n```bash\nsubg16_nvme time jobname <billing project id> diskspace\n```\n\nThe requested disk space is given in GB.\n\n## Performance considerations\n\nHere we give a brief example on what type of resources can affect the performance\nof Gaussian and how these should be taken into consideration. We are using\n[Î±-Tocopherol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-Tocopherol) (a type of vitamin\nE) as input structure.\n\nFor a `b3lyp/cc-pVDZ, %mem=10GB` single-point calculation the results are:\n\n| platform/cores      | wall time (hh:mm:ss) |  billing units       |\n| ------------------: | -------------------: |  ------------------: |\n| Puhti/10            | 00:04:19             |  0.73                |\n| mem=20/10           | 00:04:11             |  0.85                |\n|      /20            | 00:02:16             |  0.80                |\n|      /40            | 00:01:14             |  0.85                |\n| Mahti/128           | 00:00:53             |  1.47                |\n\nFor this particular case, the scaling is reasonable up to a full Puhti node. Increasing\nthe memory reservation from 10 GB to 20 GB, doesn't speed up the calculation but only\nincreases its cost. The job is slightly faster on Mahti using 128 cores compared to\n40 cores on Puhti, but the cost is significantly higher.\n\nIf we do the same calculation but increase the size of the basis set to `b3lyp/cc-pVTZ`\nthe results are:\n\n| platform/cores      | wall time (hh:mm:ss) |  billing units       |\n| ------------------: | -------------------: |  ------------------: |\n| Puhti/40            | 00:12:48             |  10.27               |\n| Mahti/128           | 00:06:30             |  10.83               |\n\nHere we notice that the calculation on Mahti is twice as fast as on Puhti, but the cost\nis about the same.\n\nFor a wave function-based method like `MP2/cc-pVDZ`, the reserved memory (mem=), as\nwell as use of local disk (nvme) significantly affects the performance:\n\n| platform/cores      | wall time (hh:mm:ss) |  billing units       |\n| ------------------: | -------------------: |  ------------------: |\n| Puhti, mem=40/10    | 00:37:55             |  8.94                |\n|        mem=80/10    | 00:19:32             |  5.91                |\n|        mem=80/20    | 00:16:08             |  7.57                |\n|        mem=160/20   | 00:16:25             |  9.89                |\n|  nvme, mem=80/20    | 00:12:40             |  7.57                |\n|        mem=160/40   | 00:11:21             | 10.62                |\n|        mem=80/40    | 00:11:59             |  9.62                |\n|  nvme, mem=160/40   | 00:09:29             |  9.06                |\n|  nvme, mem=80/40    | 00:09:23             |  7.72                |\n| Mahti/128           | 00:14:30             | 24.17                |\n\nFrom these results we conclude that 80 GB seems to be the optimal memory allocation and\nthat the use of local disk clearly improves the performance. The speedup when going from\n20 to 40 cores, and using local disk is 1.35, that is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
