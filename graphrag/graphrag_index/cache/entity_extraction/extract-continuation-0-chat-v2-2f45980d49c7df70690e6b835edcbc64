Historically, the wrappers\nbuilt statically linked executables. In recent versions of the Cray programming\nenvironment, this is not the case anymore: libraries are now **dynamically\nlinked**. The following options are available to you to control the behavior\nof your application\n\n- Follow the default Linux policy and at runtime use the system default version\n  of the shared libraries (so may change as and when the system is upgraded)\n- Hard code the path of each library into the binary at compile time so that a\n  specific version is loaded when the application starts (as long as the library\n  is still installed). Set `CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes` at compile time to use this\n  mode.\n- Allow the currently loaded programming environment modules to select the\n  library version at runtime. Applications must not be linked with\n  `CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes` and must add the following line to the Slurm script:\n  \n  ```bash\n  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n  ```\n\nStatic linking is unsupported by Cray at the moment.\n\n### Using the wrappers with build systems\n\nTo compile an application that uses a series of `./configure`, `make`,\nand `make install` commands, you can pass the compiler wrappers in the\nappropriate environment variables.\nThis should be sufficient for a `configure` step to succeed.\n\n```bash\n$ ./configure CC=cc CXX=CC FC=ftn\n```\n\nCMake should automatically detect the Cray environment. If you want to be\non the safe side, you can explicitly provide the compiler wrappers at configure\ntime using the flags\n\n```bash\ncmake \\\n  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc \\\n  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC \\\n  -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ftn \\\n  <other options>\n```\n\nFor other tools, you can try to export environment variables so that the tool\nyou are using is aware of the wrappers.\n\n=== \"C\"\n\n    ```bash\n    export CC=cc \n    ```\n\n=== \"C++\"\n\n    ```bash\n    export CXX=CC\n    ```\n\n=== \"Fortran\"\n\n    ```bash\n    export FC=ftn\n    export F77=ftn\n    export F90=ftn\n    ```\n\n## Compile HIP Code\n\n## Using the compiler wrapper\n\nThe `PrgEnv-cray` and `PrgEnv-amd` programming environments can compile HIP \ncode using the compiler wrapper. The advantage of using the wrapper is that the\nflags to use the Cray libraries (`cray-*` modules) are automatically added \n(including MPI).\n\n=== \"PrgEnv-cray\"\n\n    ```\n    module load PrgEnv-cray\n    module load craype-accel-amd-gfx90a\n    module load rocm\n\n    CC -xhip -o <yourapp> <hip_source.cpp>\n    ```\n\n=== \"PrgEnv-amd\"\n\n    ```\n    module load PrgEnv-amd\n    module load craype-accel-amd-gfx90a\n    module load rocm\n\n    CC -xhip -o <yourapp> <hip_source.cpp>\n    ```\n\n### Using `hipcc`\n\nUnlike the compiler wrappers, `hipcc` do not add automatically the flags to use\nthe Cray libraries (`cray-*` modules). Loading a `craype-accel-*` will have\nno effect as well, i.e., you need to specify the target GPU architecture \nyourself with `--offload-arch`.\n\nStill, you can set the value of `HIPCC_COMPILE_FLAGS_APPEND` and \n`HIPCC_LINK_FLAGS_APPEND` environment variables to make `hipcc` behave like the\nCray compiler wrappers.\n\n```\nmodule load PrgEnv-amd\n\nexport HIPCC_COMPILE_FLAGS_APPEND=\"--offload-arch=gfx90a $(CC --cray-print-opts=cflags)\"\nexport HIPCC_LINK_FLAGS_APPEND=$(CC --cray-print-opts=libs)\n\nhipcc -o <yourapp> <hip_source.cpp>\n```\n\n## Compile an MPI Program\n\nWhen you load a programming environment, the appropriate MPI module is loaded in\nthe environment: `cray-mpich`. In addition, the `craype-network-ofi` network \ntarget module should be loaded. These two modules are loaded by default when you\nlog in to LUMI.\n\nCompiling an MPI application is done using the set of compiler wrappers\n(`cc`, `CC`, `ftn`). The wrappers will automatically link codes with the MPI\nlibraries. You can see the compiler wrappers as the more the familiar `mpicc`, \n`mpicxx` and `mpifort` wrappers.\n\nIf you are using a build system that uses a `configure` script, you may need to\nprovide the appropriate variables so that the correct wrapper is used.\nFor example\n\n```bash\n$ ./configure MPICC=cc MPICXX=CC MPIF77=ftn MPIF90=ftn\n```\n\nFor CMake, if you already provided the compiler as described \n[in the previous section](#using-the-wrappers-with-build-systems), CMake should\ncorrectly select the wrappers as the MPI compilers.\n\n### GPU-aware MPI\n\nIf your application requires a GPU-aware MPI implementation, i.e., pass GPU \nmemory pointers directly to MPI without copying to the host first, then you need to\nlink your code to the GPU Transfer Library (GTL). The compiler wrappers will\nlink automatically to this library if a GPU target module (`craype-accel-*`) is\nloaded.\n\n=== \"PrgEnv-cray\"\n\n    ```\n    module load P\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CRAY COMPILER WRAPPERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Historically built statically linked executables but now support dynamically linked libraries and offer various options for controlling application behavior)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides a programming environment and compiler wrappers for compiling code, including support for dynamic linking and GPU code compilation)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRGENV-CRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming environment by Cray for compiling HIP code with compiler wrapper)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRGENV-AMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming environment by Cray for compiling HIP code with compiler wrapper, tailored for AMD architectures)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIPCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A compiler for HIP code that requires manual specification of Cray library flags unlike Cray compiler wrappers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY MPICH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MPI module loaded in the environment for compiling MPI applications with Cray compiler wrappers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYPE-NETWORK-OFI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Network target module loaded alongside cray-mpich for compiling MPI applications)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPU TRANSFER LIBRARY (GTL)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Library linked by compiler wrappers for GPU-aware MPI implementation)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRGENV-CRAY<|>CRAY<|>PrgEnv-cray is a programming environment provided by Cray<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRGENV-AMD<|>CRAY<|>PrgEnv-amd is a programming environment provided by Cray, specifically for AMD architectures<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIPCC<|>CRAY<|>hipcc is a tool that can be used in the Cray programming environment for compiling HIP code, with manual flag specification<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAY MPICH<|>CRAY<|>cray-mpich is an MPI module provided by Cray for compiling MPI applications<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAYPE-NETWORK-OFI<|>CRAY MPICH<|>craype-network-ofi is a network target module that is used alongside cray-mpich for MPI applications<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPU TRANSFER LIBRARY (GTL)<|>CRAY<|>The GPU Transfer Library (GTL) is linked automatically by Cray compiler wrappers for GPU-aware MPI applications<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
