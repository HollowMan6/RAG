You can also use previous information\nfrom similar completed jobs.\n\n## seff - Slurm EFFiciency\n\n`seff` will print a summary of requested and used resources for both running\nand finished batch jobs:\n\n```\nseff <slurm jobid>\n```\n\nYou can also add the `seff` command to the end of your batch script to print\nthe memory usage at the end of the job to stdout.\n\n```\nseff $SLURM_JOBID\n```\n\nNote, `seff` won't show data for *running* jobs that have been launched without\n`srun`, but statistics are good once the job has ended. `seff` will also show\naggregate data on GPU usage efficiency.\n\n```\n[user@puhti-login11 ~]$ seff 22361601\nJob ID: 22361601\nCluster: puhti\nUser/Group: user/user\nState: COMPLETED (exit code 0)\nNodes: 1\nCores per node: 40\nCPU Utilized: 04:01:36\nCPU Efficiency: 96.13% of 04:11:20 core-walltime\nJob Wall-clock time: 00:06:17\nMemory Utilized: 5.55 GB (estimated maximum)\nMemory Efficiency: 71.04% of 7.81 GB (200.00 MB/core)\nJob consumed 4.27 CSC billing units based on following used resources\nBilled project: project_2001234\nCPU BU: 4.19\nMem BU: 0.08\n```\n\nNotes on the data above: CPU efficiency has been very good (96%) and memory\nefficiency 71%. That's fine as only about 2 GB was left unused. A few GB\nsafety margin for total memory is advised.\n\n## Custom queries to Slurm accounting\n\nYou can check the time and memory usage of a completed job also with `sacct`\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nsacct -o jobid,reqmem,maxrss,averss,elapsed -j <slurm jobid>\n```\n\nwhere `-o` flag specifies output as:\n\n* `jobid` = Slurm job ID with extensions for job steps.\n* `reqmem` = Memory that you asked from Slurm.\n* `maxrss` = Maximum amount of memory used at any time by any process in that\n  job. This applies directly for serial jobs. For parallel jobs, you need to\n  multiply with the number of cores (max. 40 on Puhti, as this is reported only\n  for that node that used the most memory).\n* `averss` = The average memory used per process (or core). To get the total\n  memory usage, multiply this with the number of cores (max. 40 on Puhti, i.e.\n  a full node) in case you request memory with `--mem=<value>` and not\n  `--mem-per-cpu=<value>`.\n* `elapsed` = Time it took for the job to complete.\n\nSo, for example, the same job as above:\n\n```\n[user@puhti-login11 ~]$ sacct -j 22361601 -o jobid,reqmem,maxrss,averss,elapsed\nJobID            ReqMem     MaxRSS     AveRSS    Elapsed \n------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- \n22361601          8000M                         00:06:17 \n22361601.ba+                 7286K      7286K   00:06:17 \n22361601.ex+                 2349K      2349K   00:06:17 \n22361601.0                 145493K  139994035   00:06:17 \n```\n\nNote the following:\n\n* Lines containing job steps suffixed with `.ba+` and `.ex+` are related to\n  setting up the batch job, you don't need to worry about them at this point.\n* You've requested 200 MB per core, i.e. a total of 40 x 200 MB = 8000 MB\n  (= 7.81 GB as reported by `seff`).\n* Your job has used a maximum of 145493 KB, i.e. 142 MB memory per core. \n  Multiplying by the number of cores (40) gives the total memory usage as 5683\n  MB = 5.55 GB (as also reported by `seff`).\n* A batch job of 6 minutes is too short! If you have many such jobs, run them\n  sequentially in the same job as separate job steps. Now the overhead of\n  setting up the job is significant compared to the actual computation.\n\n!!! info \"Note on memory units\"\n    Binary prefixes are used for memory units. For example, 1 GB = 1024 MB =\n    1024² KB. This is why the unit conversions may seem confusing.\n\n## General guidelines and tips\n\nRemember that a similar, but still new, job might have different needs after\nall. If you overestimate the required runtime, your job might need to queue for\nlonger than necessary. No resources will be wasted nor billed though. Here the\nbig difference (queuing-wise) is whether the job is less than 3 days or more.\nJobs in the `longrun` partition have a lower priority and will queue for\nlonger.\n\nHowever, **if you overestimate the memory requirement, then resources will be\nwasted**. Consider this: if your job uses\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used for allocating resources for batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a cluster where the batch job was run)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEFF<|>EVENT<|>Seff is a command used to print a summary of requested and used resources for batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SACCT<|>EVENT<|>Sacct is a command used to check the time and memory usage of completed jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT_2001234<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Project_2001234 is the billed project for the usage of resources in the batch job)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEFF<|>SLURM<|>Seff is a command that operates within the SLURM workload manager to report job efficiency<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SACCT<|>SLURM<|>Sacct is a command that operates within the SLURM workload manager to report job accounting information<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_2001234<|>PUHTI<|>Project_2001234 utilized resources on the Puhti cluster for a batch job<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
