The traditional way to connect to a supercomputer is\n   [using an SSH client](#using-an-ssh-client).\n2. We also offer a [web interface](#using-the-web-interface) to our systems,\n   which enables running both graphical applications and command-line shells.\n\nFor instructions on connecting to the LUMI supercomputer, please see the\n[Get Started page in the LUMI user guide](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/getstarted/).\n\n!!! note \"Login node usage policy\"\n    When you connect to a supercomputer using an SSH client or the\n    [*Login node shell*](../webinterface/shell.md) app, you are directed to a\n    login node. Login nodes are **not meant for long or heavy processing**.\n    The accepted uses for login nodes are defined in our\n    [login node usage policy](../usage-policy.md#login-nodes).\n\n## Using the web interface\n\nThe [web interface](../webinterface/index.md) is a good platform\nfor using graphical applications on the Puhti and Mahti supercomputers.\nIt hosts\n[interactive applications for select programs](../webinterface/apps.md)\nlike Jupyter and RStudio, and for other GUI programs you can use the\n[remote desktop](../webinterface/desktop.md) interface.\n\nIt is also possible to [open a shell program](../webinterface/shell.md) on a\nlogin node or compute node. The compute node shell is persistent, meaning it\nwill keep running even if you close your browser or lose your internet\nconnection. The shell applications are especially convenient for users whose\nworkstation has a Windows operating system, since Windows does not\ntypically come with a pre-installed SSH client. See the instructions for\n[connecting to Puhti and Mahti web interfaces](../webinterface/connecting.md).\n\n## Using an SSH client\n\nUnix-based systems like macOS and Linux typically come with a pre-installed\nterminal program called simply *Terminal*. The instructions for using an\n[SSH client on macOS and Linux](ssh-unix.md) show how to connect to a CSC\nsupercomputer using the terminal program.\n\nWhile Windows systems do not have a similar pre-existing solution for connecting\nover SSH, there are multiple programs that can be used for this. The\ninstructions for using an [SSH client on Windows](ssh-windows.md) lists a few\npopular options.\n\nOnce the SSH connection to the supercomputer is open, you can interact with it\nby issuing Linux commands using the Bash shell program. An introduction to\nworking on the Linux command-line can be found in our\n[Linux basics tutorial for CSC](../../support/tutorials/env-guide/index.md).\nYou can have several connections to CSC supercomputers open at the same time.\n\n!!! note \"SSH keys\"\n    When you connect over SSH, you can log in using your CSC account password, but\n    it is more convenient and secure to [set up SSH keys](ssh-keys.md) and use\n    them for authentication.\n\n### First connection\n\nWhen connecting to a given supercomputer for the first time, the SSH client\nmay notify you that the host is unknown, and ask you to confirm the connection.\nWith the OpenSSH client, the message looks like this:\n\n```text\nThe authenticity of host 'puhti.csc.fi' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:kk0Tar9opQ+6Gq0GWJdWVVvFEMeI6kW1DW1VOYveT5c.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\n```\n\nIn order to continue, you should confirm that the displayed key fingerprint is\nfound in the [table below](#host-key-fingerprints), and then enter `yes`. You\nwill not be asked again unless the server key changes, in which case you\nshould again verify the new key against fingerprints provided by CSC.\n\n#### Host key fingerprints\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n    | SHA256 checksum                             | Key                                |\n    |---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n    | kk0Tar9opQ+6Gq0GWJdWVVvFEMeI6kW1DW1VOYveT5c | ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub (ECDSA)     |\n    | Q2lpykI43ffs4PrRODZ/qncjUo3eyrRHc5T9yjJEwWY | ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub (ED25519) |\n    | WH1Ag2OQtMPZb+hj3YeH9uVMMetXpCvyNUbsdk0Qcpk | ssh_host_rsa_key.pub (RSA)         |\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n    | SHA256 checksum                             | Key                                |\n    |---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n    | WC9Lb5tmKDzUJqsQjaZLvp9T7LTs3aMUYSIy2OCdtgg | ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub (ECDSA)     |\n    | tE+1jA4Et1enbbat1V3dMRWlLtJgA8t7ZrkyIkU4ooo | ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub (ED25519) |\n    | 0CxM3ECpD2LhAnMfHnm3YaXresvHrhW4cevvcPb+HNw | ssh_host_rsa_key.pub (RSA)         |\n\n### Graphical connection\n\nWe recommend using the web interfaces for running applications with graphical\nuser interfaces.
