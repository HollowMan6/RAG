They wish to view and analyse your data, but you want to restrict their ability to download a copy of the data directly.\n\n## Solution\n\nIn this case you can share your data folder to Team B with **Read to SD Desktop** -permission. That way Team B members can view and analyse the data via SD Desktop, without downloading a copy of the original data.\n\nYou also don’t want Team B to export your original data from SD Desktop. That is why you need to create a project where they (Team B) are project members and you are the project manager - since only project manager can export data from SD Desktop.\n\n\n![Transfer Data Infograph](https://a3s.fi/docs-files/sensitive-data/SD_Connect/UseCase_ReadToDesktop.png)\n\n!!! warning\n    Note that you have to be the project manager of the both projects. Please contact us at *servicedesk@csc.fi* subject: *Sensitive data* to discuss this share option before proceeding.\n\n## Step by step tutorial\n\n1. Log in to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/login){ target=\"_blank\" }.\n2. Create two new projects: ***Project 1*** and ***Project 2***.\n3. Manage ***Project 1***: enable service access for SD Connect. Do not add any project members. [See instructions](./sd-access.md)\n4. Manage ***Project 2***: enable service access for SD Connect and SD Desktop. Add Team B to be the **project members.** [See instructions](./sd-access.md)\n5. Log in to [SD Connect](./sd-connect-login.md).\n6. Select ***Project 2*** and copy the **Share ID**. \n![screenshot](https://a3s.fi/docs-files/sensitive-data/SD_Connect/UseCase_ShareID2.png)\n7. Select ***Project 1*** and upload your data folder there: [See upload instructions](./sd-connect-upload.md).\n8. Click “**Share**” next to the folder you just uploaded.\n![screenshot](https://a3s.fi/docs-files/sensitive-data/SD_Connect/UseCase_ShareButton2.png)\n9. Add the **Share ID** of Project 2 to the field.\n![screenshot](https://a3s.fi/docs-files/sensitive-data/SD_Connect/UseCase_AddShareID2.png)\n10. Select sharing permission: “**Read to SD Desktop**”. Click “**Share**”.\n![screenshot](https://a3s.fi/docs-files/sensitive-data/SD_Connect/UseCase_SelectPermission2.png)\n\nNow, all the content in the folder is visible to Project 2 (Team B) and accessible only through SD Desktop. Project 2 members can access and analyse the shared folder content via SD desktop. However, they cannot export or download files, as all data exports are managed directly by the project manager - and you are the project manager of both projects.\n\n\n## Features in SD Connect \n\n* [Upload](./sd-connect-upload.md)\n* [Share](./sd-connect-share.md)\n* [Download](./sd-connect-download.md)\n* [Delete](./sd-connect-delete.md)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
