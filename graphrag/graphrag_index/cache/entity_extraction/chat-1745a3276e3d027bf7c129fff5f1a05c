This is suitable for all file types and formats. Automated encryption and data upload via a web browser is for files up to 100 GB. Files larger than 100 GB can be automatically encrypted and uploaded [programmatically](./sd-connect-command-line-interface.md).\n\n## Upload and encrypt files to a new folder\n\n1. Log in to SD Connect.\n2. Select the correct CSC project in the top left corner.\n3. Click **Upload** in the top right corner.\n4. In the new window, name the destination folder for your files.\n5. Click **Select Files** to open a browser window and choose files for upload. If you want to upload folders, drag and drop them into the window. Click **Upload** to start automatic encryption and upload.\n6. Notification about the status of upload will appear and be visible until the upload is completed. Notification also includes a link to the destination folder.\n7. Once the upload is finished, the encrypted files are accessible for downloading and sharing via SD Connect or for analysis, editing or annotation via SD Desktop.\n\n!!! info \"Folder names\"\n    \n    - Folder names must be unique across all existing folders in all projects in SD Connect and Allas (the cloud storage solution based on which SD Connect is developed). If you can't create a new folder, another project may already use the name you have chosen. To avoid this situation, it is good practice to include projec specific identifiers (e.g., project ID number or acronym) in the folder name.\n    - Avoid spaces and special characters; use Latin alphabets (a-z), numbers (0-9), dash (-), underscore (_), and dot (.). Remember, all folder names are public; please do not include any confidential information.\n    - Folder names can't be modified afterwards.\n\n\n## Upload and encrypt files to an existing folder\n\n1. Select the correct folder (by double-click).\n2. Click **Upload** in the top right corner and follow steps from 4 to 6 in above paragraph.\n\n\n!!! warning \"Warning\"\n    \n    Members in the same CSC project can download and decrypt data from SD Connect. This can be limited by sharing files with **Read to SD Desktop** permission. [Read about use case](./sd-connect-share-read-to-sd-desktop.md)\n\n\n\n!!! Note \"Additional considerations\"\n\n    - Uploading large or numerous files may take several hours depending on the internet speed. Note that upload will be automatically stopped after 8 hours.\n    - SD Connect user interface visualises the destination folders where your encrypted data is stored. Think of the destination folder like a virtual box on the internet where you keep your digital files—like photos or documents.\n    - You can't edit files directly in SD Connect. Editing is possible after downloading files on your laptop or by accessing the files via SD Desktop.\n    - Planning how to organise your files in SD Connect  folders is a crucial step for efficient data management. Carefully consider storing the files based on projects, themes, or logical structures to enhance accessibility and streamline workflow. A well-thought-out folder structure also facilitates collaboration when sharing access with others.
