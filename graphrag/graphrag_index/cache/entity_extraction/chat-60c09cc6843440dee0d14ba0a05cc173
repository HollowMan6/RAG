It is based on the density-functional theory (DFT)\nimplemented within the projector augmented wave (PAW), and it can utilize\nvarious basis sets (uniform real-space grids, plane waves, localized\natomic orbital basis).\n\nSome features of the software include:\n\n- total energy calculations\n- structural optimizations\n- different boundary conditions (finite, wire, slab, bulk)\n- efficient parallelization\n- excited state properties within time-dependent density-functional\n    theory\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 20.10.0, 21.1.0, 21.6.0, 22.1.0, 22.8.0\n- Mahti: 20.10.0, 21.1.0, 21.6.0, 22.1.0, 22.8.0, 23.9.1, 24.1.0\n- Check all available versions (and default version) with\n    `module avail gpaw`\n- Modules ending with `-omp` have the optional OpenMP parallelization enabled,\n    see [GPAW documentation about parallel runs](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/documentation/parallel_runs/parallel_runs.html?highlight=openmp#manual-openmp)\n    for more details.\n\n### PAW Setups\n\nAll installations (except 24.1.0) use version **0.9.20000** of GPAW's PAW Setups.\n\n## License\n\nGPAW is free software available under GPL, version 3+.\n\n## Usage\n\nSince the default version, that is available with `module load gpaw`, is\nsubject to change when new versions are installed, we recommend to always load\na specific GPAW version:\n\n```bash\nmodule load gpaw/version\n```\n\n!!! warning \"Note\"\n    In CSC environment, GPAW calculations are run with the `gpaw-python` command.\n\n### Enabling ELPA\n\nOn Mahti, GPAW can use the ELPA library to speed up the diagonalization step. Especially with LCAO calculations, ELPA can improve\nthe performance. In order to use ELPA, the `'use_elpa' : True` setting needs to be included in the parallelization options in GPAW input\n(see [GPAW documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/documentation/lcao/lcao.html#notes-on-performance) for more information).\n\n### Batch script examples\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash -l\n    #SBATCH --time=00:30:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=large\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40\n    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2GB\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    ##SBATCH --mail-type=END #uncomment to get mail\n\n    # this script runs a 80 core (2 full nodes) gpaw job, requesting\n    # 30 minutes time and 2 GB of memory for each core\n\n    module load gpaw/21.1.0\n\n    srun gpaw-python input.py\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti (hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash -l\n    #SBATCH --time=00:30:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=medium\n    #SBATCH --nodes=10\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=32\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    ##SBATCH --mail-type=END #uncomment to get mail\n\n    # this script runs a 1280 core (10 full nodes) gpaw job, using hybrid\n    # MPI/OpenMP parallelization with 4 OpenMP threads per node,\n    # requesting 30 minutes time.\n    # Please experiment with optimum MPI task / OpenMP thread ratio with\n    # your particular input\n\n    # Note: only the modules with \"-omp\" ending supports OpenMP\n    # (default version in Mahti is OpenMP enabled)\n\n    module load gpaw/21.1.0-omp\n\n    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n\n    srun gpaw-python input.py\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti (pure MPI parallelization)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash -l\n    #SBATCH --time=00:30:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=medium\n    #SBATCH --nodes=10\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    ##SBATCH --mail-type=END #uncomment to get mail\n\n    # this script runs a 1280 core (10 full nodes) gpaw job, using pure\n    # MPI parallelization requesting 30 minutes time.\n\n    module load gpaw/21.1.0\n\n    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n\n    srun gpaw-python input.py\n    ```\n\n## More information\n\n- [GPAW home page](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
