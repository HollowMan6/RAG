All project members have equal access to the data in Allas\n   - Default quota is 10 TB per project\n- Clients available on Puhti and Mahti\n   - See Docs CSC for instructions on [accessing Allas from LUMI](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/allas_lumi/)\n\n# The Allas object storage: what it is NOT\n\n- **Allas is not a file system** (even though many tools try to fool you to think so)\n    - It is just a place for static data objects\n- **Allas is not a data management environment**\n    - Tools for search, metadata, version control and access management are minimal\n- **Allas is not a proper backup service**\n    - Project members can delete all the data with just one command\n\n# Storing files in Allas\n\n- An object is stored on multiple servers\n    - A disk or server failure does not cause data loss\n- There is no backup, i.e. if a file is accidentally deleted, it cannot be recovered\n- Data cannot be modified in the object storage\n    - For computation, the data has to be typically copied to a file system on some computer\n- Some data management features are built on top of Allas\n- Data can be shared publicly to the Internet, which is otherwise not easily possible at CSC\n\n# Allas buckets\n\n- Storage space in Allas is provided per **CSC project**\n- The project space can have multiple **buckets** (up to 1000)\n    - Some sources refer to *buckets* as *containers*\n        - Must not be confused with Docker/Apptainer containers!\n- The name of the bucket must be unique within Allas\n\n# Allas objects\n\n- Data is stored as **objects** within a bucket\n    - Objects can contain any type of data (generally, object == file)\n    - Objects have metadata that can be enriched\n- In Allas, you can have 500 000 objects per bucket\n- There is only one level of hierarchy of buckets (no buckets within buckets)\n    - There is no hierarchical directory structure, although it sometimes looks like that\n\n# Allas supports two protocols\n\n- S3 (used by `s3cmd`, `rclone`, `a-tools`)\n- Swift (used by `swift`, `rclone`, `a-tools`, `cyberduck`)  \n- Authentication and file handling is different for the protocols\n- **Avoid cross-using Swift and S3-based objects!**\n\n# Allas clients\n\n- **Puhti, Mahti, Linux servers, Mac:**\n    - `rclone`, `swift`, `s3cmd`, `a-tools`\n- **Laptops (Windows, Mac):**\n    - [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), [FileZilla (pro)](https://filezilla-project.org/), [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi), [Mahti web interface](https://mahti.csc.fi)\n- **Virtual machines, small servers:**\n    - In addition to the tools above, you can use FUSE-based virtual mounts\n\n# Allas -- first steps\n\n- Use [My CSC](https://my.csc.fi) to apply for Allas access for your project -- Allas is not automatically available\n- In Puhti/Mahti, setup connection to Allas using the commands:\n  ```bash\n  module load allas\n  allas-conf\n  ```\n- [Study the manual and start using Allas with `rclone` or `a-tools`](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/)\n- [This course](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/part-1/allas/) includes also hands-on tutorials and a tutorial video about Allas\n\n# Allas -- `rclone`\n\n- Straightforward power-user tool with a wide range of features\n- Fast and efficient\n- Available for Linux, Mac and Windows\n- **Overwrites and removes data without asking!**\n   - Use with care: [`rclone` instructions at Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/using_allas/rclone/)\n\n# Allas -- `a-tools`\n\n- `a-tools` provide an easy and safe way to use Allas for occasional Allas users\n- Default bucket names are based on directories on Puhti/Mahti\n- Unlike `rclone`, `a-tools` does not overwrite or remove data without asking!\n- Developed for the CSC supercomputers, but you can install the tools in other Linux and Mac machines as well\n- Automatic packing (compression can be enabled as well if needed)\n- [a-commands instructions at Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/data/All\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a CEPH-based object storage service provided by CSC for computing and cloud services, designed for data storage during project lifetimes with a default quota of 10 TB per project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is the organization that offers the Allas object storage service and is involved in computing and cloud services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of the CSC's supercomputers that provides access to Allas clients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another supercomputer by CSC that provides access to Allas clients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a platform mentioned in the context of accessing Allas, implying it's another computing resource or service related to CSC)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>Allas is a service provided by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd for data storage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>PUHTI<|>Allas clients are available on Puhti, indicating a service relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>MAHTI<|>Allas clients are available on Mahti, indicating a service relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>LUMI<|>Allas can be accessed from LUMI, suggesting a compatibility or service extension<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
