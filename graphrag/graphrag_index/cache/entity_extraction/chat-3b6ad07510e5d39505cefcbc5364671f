The software stacks are made available through the [LMOD module\nenvironment][module-environment].\n\n## Overview\n\nOn LUMI, three types of software stacks are currently offered:\n\n-   `CrayEnv` offers the Cray Programming Environment (PE) and allows one to use\n    it completely in the way intended by HPE-Cray. The environment also offers a\n    limited selection of additional tools, often in updated versions compared to\n    what SUSE Linux, the basis of the Cray Linux environment, offers. If you\n    need a richer environment, you should use our other software stacks.\n\n-   `LUMI` is an extensible software stack mostly managed through\n    [EasyBuild][easybuild]. You can read more about EasyBuild on LUMI on\n    [the \"Easybuild\" page in the \"Software\" section][eb-in-docs]. \n    Each version of the LUMI software stack is based on the\n    version of the Cray Programming Environment with the same version number.\n\n    A deliberate choice was made to only offer a limited number of software\n    packages in the globally installed stack as the setup of redundancy on LUMI\n    makes it difficult to update the stack in a way that is guaranteed to not\n    affect running jobs and as a large central stack is also hard to manage.\n    However, the EasyBuild setup is such that users can easily install\n    additional software in their home or project directory using EasyBuild build\n    recipes that we provide or they develop, and that software will fully\n    integrate in the central stack (even the corresponding modules will be made\n    available automatically).\n\n-   `spack` is an extensible software stack based on the \n    [Spack package manager][spack-site]. You can read more about Spack on LUMI\n    on [the \"Spack\" page in the \"Software\" section][spack-in-docs].\n    Spack is offered \"as-is\" for users experienced in the use of Spack, but\n    properly pre-configured to use compilers and some libraries already installed\n    on the system. The LUMI User Support Team does not implement new Spack packages or\n    debug build recipes for existing ones.\n\n## Selecting the software stack\n\nRunning `module avail` on a fresh shell will show a list like:\n\n```bash\n$ module avail\n\n... some lines removed here\n\n-------------------------- HPE-Cray PE modules ----------------------------\n   PrgEnv-amd/8.3.3\n   PrgEnv-amd/8.4.0              (D)\n   PrgEnv-aocc/8.3.3\n\n... some lines removed here\n\n----------------------------- Software stacks -----------------------------\n   CrayEnv    (S)      LUMI/23.03  (S)    spack/22.08-2\n   LUMI/22.08 (S,D)    LUMI/23.09  (S)    spack/23.03\n   LUMI/22.12 (S)      spack/22.08        spack/23.03-2 (D)\n\n--------------------- Modify the module display style ---------------------\n   ModuleColour/off      (S)        ModuleLabel/PEhierarchy (S)\n   ModuleColour/on       (S,D)      ModuleLabel/system      (S)\n   ModuleExtensions/hide (S)        ModulePowerUser/LUMI    (S)\n   ModuleExtensions/show (S,D)      ModuleStyle/default\n   ModuleLabel/label     (S,L,D)    ModuleStyle/reset       (D)\n\n-------------------------- System initialisation --------------------------\n   init-lumi/0.2 (S,L)\n\n------------------------- Non-PE HPE-Cray modules -------------------------\n\n... some lines removed here\n\n------------------- This is a list of module extensions -------------------\n    rclone (E)     restic (E)     s3cmd (E)\n\n... some lines removed here\n```\n\nThe first block(s) in the output are the modules available through the default\nsoftware stack.\n\nThe *Software stacks* block in the output shows the available software stacks:\n`CrayEnv`, 4 versions of the `LUMI` stack and \n4 versions of the `spack` stack in this example. The `(S)` besides the\nname shows that these are sticky modules that won't be removed by default by\n``module purge``. This is done to enable you to quickly clean your environment\nwithout having to re-initialize from scratch. In the future we may mark some\nstacks also with `LTS` next to their name which would then denote that this is\na release that we will try to support long-term (ideally two years), but\ncurrently the system is changing too rapidly (as some of the hardware is new\nand not an evolution of previous hardware) so we cannot guarantee any level of\nlongevity for any of the software stacks. In fact, experience has shown\nthat we may have to remove a stack after a year or so.\n\nThe next block, titled *Modify the module\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
