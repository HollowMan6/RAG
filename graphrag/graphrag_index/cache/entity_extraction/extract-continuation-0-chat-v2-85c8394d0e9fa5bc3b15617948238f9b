One way to do this is to check the size of any\nexisting files and assess the final space requirement based on these. The quota\nsize of most CSC services can easily be increased (or decreased) in the\n[MyCSC customer portal](../../accounts/how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md).\n\n!!! note\n    Gibibyte (GiB) = 1,073,741,824 bytes, or about 1,073 gigabytes (GB)\n    \nIt is also worth noting that transferring large amounts of data takes time. For\nexample, transferring a 1 GiB file over a 10 Mbps connection typically takes\nabout 10 minutes and over a high-speed 100 Mb fixed connection a couple of\nminutes. We recommend using, for example, the fast fixed connection provided by\nthe home organization and to avoid using browser interfaces to transfer large\namounts of files / data.\n\n**File size units from the smallest to the largest:**\n\n- 1 byte (B) = the basic unit of digital information\n- 1 kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes\n- 1 mebibyte (MiB) = 1024 kibibytes\n- 1 gibibyte (GiB) = 1024 mebibytes\n- 1 tebibyte (TiB) = 1024 gibibytes\n- 1 pebibyte (PiB) = 1024 tebibytes \n\n**Example file sizes for different types of data**\n\nNote that file sizes can vary a lot, depending for example on the quality of an\nimage or video.\n\n|File                                   |Average file size|Number of files in 1 GiB|Number of files in 25 GiB|Number of files in 1 TiB|\n|:-------------------------------------:|:---------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------------:|\n|Word processing file                   |730 KiB          |1400                    |35000                    |1436000                 |\n|Presentation (ppt)                     |6 MiB            |170                     |4300                     |174000                  |\n|JPEG picture                           |300 KiB          |3400                    |85000                    |3495000                 |\n|JPEG photograph taken with a smartphone|3 MiB            |340                     |8500                     |349000                  |\n|PDF document                           |3 MiB            |340                     |8500                     |349000                  |\n|MPEG video                             |650 MiB          |1                       |39                       |1600                    |\n|30 min HD video                        |2,1 GiB          |0                       |12                       |490                     |\n|full DVD                               |4,7 GiB          |0                       |6                        |218                     |\n|Human genome sequence                  |60 GiB           |0                       |0                        |17                      |\n\n**Average file size** is based on data from 14,000 word processing files, 1,000\npresentation graphics files, 4 million JPEG images, 27,000 PDF files, and 7,000\nMPEG files related to the study, as well as data from 5 non-study 30-minute HD\nh264 videos. \n\n## Storage Comparison Table\n\nWe provide multiple storage options for research purposes.
