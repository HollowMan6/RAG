For example command:\n\n```text\ns3cmd signurl s3://fish-bucket/zebrafish.tgz +3600\n```\nwould print out an URL that remains valid for 3600 s (1 h). In this case URL, produced by the command above, would look something like:\n```text\nhttps://fish-bucket.a3s.fi/zebrafish.tgz?AWSAccessKeyId=78e6021a086d52f092b3b2b23bfd7a67&Expires=1599835116&Signature=OLyyCY14s%2F0HxKOOd108mldINyE%3D\n```\n\n## Setting up an object lifecycle\n\nIn order to delete/expire objects automatically, a lifecycle policy can be set-up to the Allas bucket. Objects in the bucket are treated per the lifecycle policy if matching conditions are found. Matching conditions can be set to a prefix and/or tag(s) within the object. Lifecycle policy is especially well suited for the cases where data needs to be removed as a \"maintenance\" measure after certain intervals.\n\n!!! warning\n    Before setting up the lifecycle policy, please check with your department/team that it correctly represents the retention policy for the data in the project. (Legal or regulatory constrains).\n\nIn the following lifecycle policy we have two rules set. let's name it as `mypolicy.xml`.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<LifecycleConfiguration xmlns=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/\">\n   <Rule>\n      <ID>1-days-expiration</ID>\n      <Status>Enabled</Status>\n      <Expiration>\n         <Days>1</Days>\n      </Expiration>\n      <Filter>\n         <Tag>\n            <Key>days</Key>\n            <Value>1</Value>\n         </Tag>\n      </Filter>\n   </Rule>\n   <Rule>\n      <ID>30-days-expiration</ID>\n      <Status>Enabled</Status>\n      <Expiration>\n         <Days>30</Days>\n      </Expiration>\n      <Filter>\n         <Tag>\n            <Key>days</Key>\n            <Value>30</Value>\n         </Tag>\n      </Filter>\n   </Rule>\n</LifecycleConfiguration>\n```\n\nAlternatively, one can set the policies using `prefix` which can be thought as an equivalent to `folder`. Both methods can also be combined using `<And>` tag.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<LifecycleConfiguration xmlns=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/\">\n   <Rule>\n      <ID>Daily</ID>\n      <Status>Enabled</Status>\n      <Prefix>daily/</Prefix>\n      <Expiration>\n         <Days>30</Days>\n      </Expiration>\n   </Rule>\n   <Rule>\n      <ID>Weekly</ID>\n      <Status>Enabled</Status>\n      <Prefix>weekly/</Prefix>\n      <Expiration>\n         <Days>365</Days>\n      </Expiration>\n   </Rule>\n</LifecycleConfiguration>\n```\n\nTo set this lifecycle policy into our bucket, we use the `setlifecycle` sub-command:\n\n```bash\ns3cmd setlifecycle mypolicy.xml s3://MY_BUCKET\n```\n\nWe can verify current policy with `getlifecycle` sub-command:\n\n```bash\ns3cmd getlifecycle s3://MY_BUCKET\n```\n\nTo review the bucket (or object) with `info` sub-command:\n\n```bash\ns3cmd info s3://MY_BUCKET\n\ns3://MY_BUCKET/ (bucket):\n   Location:  cpouta-production\n   Payer:     BucketOwner\n   Expiration Rule: objects with key prefix 'weekly/' will expire in '365' day(s) after creation\n   Policy:    none\n   CORS:      none\n   ACL:       project_xxxxxxx: FULL_CONTROL\n```\n\nIn order to put your object(s) under the lifecycle policy, you may utilize tags and/or prefixes.\n\n* Tagging is done with adding a header with the format `x-amz-tagging:KEY=VALUE`.\n* Prefix can be considered as a \"folder\".\n\nLet's see the following cases:\n\n```bash\n# Should be removed in 24 hours per rule ID: 1-days-expiration\ns3cmd --add-header=x-amz-tagging:days=1 put MY_FILE_01.tar.gz s3://MY_BUCKET/\ns3cmd --add-header=x-amz-tagging:days=1 put MY_FILE_02.tar.gz s3://MY_BUCKET/gone-in-one-day/\n\n# Should be removed in 30 days per rule ID: 30-days-expiration\ns3cmd --add-header=x-amz-tagging:days=30 put MY_FILE_03.tar.gz s3://MY_BUCKET/\n\n# Should be removed in 30 days per rule ID: Daily\ns3cmd put MY_FILE_04.tar.gz\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
