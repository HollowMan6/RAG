To run an\ninteractive job on a GPU node, use `sinteractive` command\n[with the `-g` option](./interactive-usage.md#sinteractive-on-puhti),\nwhich submits the job to the `gpu` partition instead. Note that you can only\nrun two simultaneous jobs on the Puhti `interactive` partition.\n\n| Partition     | Time<br>limit | Max CPU<br>cores | Max<br>nodes | [Node types](../systems-puhti.md) | Max memory<br>per node | Max local storage<br>([NVMe]) per node |\n|---------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| `interactive` | 7 days        | 8                | 1            | IO                                | 76 GiB                 | 720 GiB                                |\n\n## Mahti partitions\n\n### Mahti CPU partitions\n\nMahti features the following partitions for submitting jobs to CPU nodes. Jobs\nsubmitted to these partitions occupy\n[all of the resources available on a node](../systems-mahti.md#compute-nodes)\nand make it inaccessible to other jobs. Thus, your job should ideally be able\nto utilize all 128 cores available on each reserved node efficiently. Although\nin certain situations it may be worthwhile to\n[undersubscribe nodes](creating-job-scripts-mahti.md#undersubscribing-nodes),\nnote that your job will still consume billing units based on the amount of\nreserved *nodes*, not CPU cores.\n\nSome partitions are only available under special conditions. The `large`\npartition is only accessible to projects that have\n[completed a scalability test](../../accounts/how-to-access-mahti-large-partition.md)\nand demonstrated good utilization of the partition resources. The `gc`\npartition, which allows users to run extremely large simulations, is only\naccessible to\n[Grand Challenge projects](https://research.csc.fi/grand-challenge-proposals).\n\n| Partition | Time<br>limit | CPU cores<br>per node | Nodes<br>per job | [Node types](../systems-mahti.md) | Memory<br>per node | Max local storage<br>([NVMe]) per node | Requirements                    |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| `test`    | 1 hour        | 128                   | 1–2              | CPU                               | 256 GiB            | n/a                                    | n/a                             |\n| `medium`  | 36 hours      | 128                   | 1–20             | CPU                               | 256 GiB            | n/a                                    | n/a                             |\n| `large`   | 36 hours      | 128                   | 20–200           | CPU                               | 256 GiB            | n/a                                    | [scalability test]              |\n| `gc`      | 36 hours      | 128                   | 200–700          | CPU                               | 256 GiB            | n/a                                    | [Grand Challenge project]       |\n\n### Mahti GPU partitions\n\nMahti features the following partitions for submitting jobs to GPU nodes.\nUnless otherwise specified, the job is allocated 122.5 GiB of memory for\neach reserved GPU.\n\n| Partition   | Time<br>limit | Max<br>GPUs | Max CPU<br>cores | Max<br>nodes | [Node types](../systems-mahti.md) | Max memory<br>per node | Max local storage<br>([NVMe]) per node |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| `gputest`   | 15 minutes    | 4           | 128              | 1            | GPU                               | 490 GiB                | 3800 GiB                               |\n| `gpusmall`  | 36 hours      | 2           | 64               | 1            | GPU                               | 490 GiB                | 3800 GiB                               |\n| `gpumedium` | 36 hours      | 24          | 768              | 6            | GPU                               | 490 GiB                | 3800 GiB                               |\n\n!!! info \"Fair use of GPU nodes on Mahti\"\n    You should reserve **no more than 32 CPU cores per GPU**.\n\n#### GPU slices\n\nA subset of the Nvidia A100 GPUs on the Mahti `gpusmall` partition are divided\ninto a total of 28 smaller GPU slices, which have one-seventh of the\ncompute and memory capacity of a full A100 GPU. You are able to reserve at\nmost 4 CPU cores when using a GPU slice. Additionally, the job is allocated\n17.5 GiB of memory, and there is no way to request a different amount. Finally,\nyou are only able to reserve one GPU slice per job. The GPU slices are intended\nespecially for interactive use that requires GPU capacity.\n\nTo reserve a GPU slice, use `sinteractive` with the `-g` option, or include the\n`--gres=gpu:a100_1g.5gb:1` option together with specifying the `gpusmall`\npartition in your batch script.
