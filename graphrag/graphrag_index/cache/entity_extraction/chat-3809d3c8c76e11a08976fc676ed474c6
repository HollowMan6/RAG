You can load it with:\n\n`module load force`\n\nBy default the latest __force__ module is loaded. If you want a specific version you can specify the version number\n\n`module load force/<VERSION_NUMBER>`\n\n## Download data from Google Cloud Storage\n\nTo download data from Google Cloud Storage using the Level 1 Cloud Storage Downloader provided by FORCE, you need to register an account and authenticate to Google cloud using your own computer using the [gsutil-tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) and copy the configuration file from your computers Home directory `$HOME/.boto` to your `$HOME` directory on Puhti. Following the instructions on [FORCE tutorials page](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/level1-csd.html#downloading-the-metadata-catalogues), you will first have to update/download the metadata catalog. We suggest to store the metadata catalog in your  projects `/scratch` directory, so that other users in your project can share the catalog:\n\n`force-level1-csd -u /path/to/your/scratch/dir` \n\nThen you can download data from Google Cloud Storage as described on the [FORCE tutorials page](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/level1-csd.html#querying-and-downloading-data).\n\n\n\n## Running FORCE commands\n\nFORCE is installed as a container, but it has wrappers for all FORCE commands, so it can be used normally. \n\nIf working interactively, you can also start a shell inside the container with\n\n`_debug_shell`\n\nWe have an example of running L1 to L2 pipeline for Sentinel images in [our Github examples](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/force)\n\n## License \n\n[FORCE is licensed under the GNU GPL License](https://github.com/davidfrantz/force/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Citation\n\nThis software can be cited by citing the appropriate [FORCE publication](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refs.html).\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nPlease acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072531) and the Open Geospatial Information Infrastructure for Research (Geoportti, urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072513) for computational resources and support\".\n\n## Installation\n\nFORCE was installed to Puhti with [Tykky's wrap-container functionality](../computing/containers/tykky.md#container-based-installations) using the [Docker image provided by the FORCE author on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidfrantz/force). \n\n`wrap-container -w /home/docker/bin docker://davidfrantz/force:latest --prefix install_dir`\n\n\n## References\n\n* [CSC Example](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/force)\n* [FORCE github](https://github.com/davidfrantz/force)\n* [FORCE documentation](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n* [FORCE tutorials](https://davidfrantz.github.io/#tutorials)\n* [FORCE google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/force_eo)\n* [FORCE v2.0 (Old) User manual](https://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/fb6/prof/FER/Downloads/Software/FORCE/FORCE-user-guide-v-2-0.pdf)\n* [Using FORCE v2.0 (Old) in CSC environment (Taito) by Pekka Hurskainen](https://research.csc.fi/documents/48467/73370/Satellite_time_series_processing_with_FORCE_in_CSC_Hurskainen.pdf/c6960f88-ec94-4c94-aca3-734c8d283268)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
