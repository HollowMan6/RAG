However, after a while, a large number of jobs may\nbe running simultaneously. When the batch job is finished, the `data_dir` directory contains 50\noutput files.\n\nAfter submitting an array job, the command\n\n```bash\nsqueue -l -u <username>\n```\n\nreveals that you have one pending job and possibly several other jobs running in the batch job\nsystem. All these jobs have a `jobid` that contains two parts: the `jobid` number of the array\njob and the subjob number. Directing the output of each subjob into a separate file is recommended\nas the file system may fail if several dozens of processes try to write into the same file at\nthe same time. If the output files need to be merged into one file, it can often be easily done\nafter the array job has finished. For example in the case above, we could collect the results\ninto one file using the command\n\n```bash\ncat data_*.out > all_data.out\n```\n\nIn the case of standard output and error files, defined in the `#SBATCH` lines,  you can use the\ndefinitions `%A` and `%a` to give unique names to the output files of each subjob. In the file\nnames, `%A` will be replaced by the ID of the array job and `%a` will be replaced by the\n`$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`.\n\n## Using a file name list in an array job\n\nIn the example above, we were able to use `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` to refer to the order numbers\nin the input files. If this type of approach is not possible, a list of files or commands created\nbefore the submission of the batch job can be used. Let's assume that we have a similar task as\ndefined above but the file names do not contain numbers but are in the format `data_aa.inp`,\n`data_ab.inp`, `data_ac.inp` and so forth. Now, we first need to make a list of the files to\nbe analyzed. In this case, we could collect the file names into the file `namelist` using the\ncommand\n\n```bash\nls data_*.inp > namelist\n```\n\nThe command\n\n```bash\nsed -n <row_number>p inputfile\n```\n\nreads a certain line from the name list file. In this case, the actual command script could be\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=array_job\n#SBATCH --output=array_job_out_%A_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --error=array_job_err_%A_%a.txt\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4000\n#SBATCH --array=1-50\n\n# set the input file to process\nname=$(sed -n ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}p namelist)\n# run the analysis\nmy_prog ${name} ${name}.out\n```\n\nThis example is otherwise similar to the first one except that it reads the name of the file to\nanalyze from the file `namelist`. This value is stored in the variable `${name}`, which is used in\nthe job execution command. As the row number to read is defined by the `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`,\neach data file listed in the file `namelist` is processed as a different subjob. Note that as\nwe now also use `${name}` in the output definition, the output file name will be in the format\n`data_aa.inp.out`, `data_ab.inp.out`, `data_ac.inp.out` and so forth.\n\n## Using array jobs in workflows with sbatch_commandlist\n\n!!! info \"sbatch-hq\"\n    A more efficient alternative to `sbatch_commandlist` is the CSC utility tool `sbatch-hq`,\n    which is essentially a wrapper for [HyperQueue](../../apps/hyperqueue.md). `sbatch-hq`\n    allows you to submit an ensemble of similar independent non-MPI parallel tasks from a\n    command list, i.e. a file in which each line corresponds to an individual subtask to be\n    executed. [See the HyperQueue page for more details](../../apps/hyperqueue.md#task-farming-with-sbatch-hq-tool).\n\nIn Puhti, you can use the command `sbatch_commandlist` to execute a list of commands as an\narray job. This command takes as an input a text file. The command list is split into several\npieces that are executed as an independent sub-task of a array batch job, automatically\ngenerated by the `sbatch_commandlist`. Thus, one subtask of an array job may process several\ncommands from the command list.\n\nThe syntax of this command is:\n\n```bash\nsbatch_commandlist -commands commandlist\n```\n\nOptions `-t` and `-mem` can be used to modify the time and memory reservation of the subjobs\n(default 12 h, 8 GB). By default, the billing project is set based on the name of the scratch\ndirectory where this command is executed, but if needed, it can be assigned using option\n`-project`. The command list is split into maximum 200 subtasks. If individual tasks are\nvery short you could use the option `--max_jobs` to decrease the splitting so that each array\njob task would take at least around half an hour to process.\n\nAfter submitting an array job, `sbatch_commandlist` starts monitoring the progress of the\njob. If you use `sbatch_commandlist` interactively in the login nodes, you normally don't\nwant to keep the monitor running for hours.
