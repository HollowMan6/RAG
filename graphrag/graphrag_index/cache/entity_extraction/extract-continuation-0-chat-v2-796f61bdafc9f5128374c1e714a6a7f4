To use the graphical display with [VirtualGL](https://virtualgl.org/), a few environment variables have to be set as well. In the base images provided for GPU usage by CSC, these are set automatically when the container is started. Note that if you run `apptainer shell` instead of `apptainer run`, `%runscript` is not executed and necessary environment variables for vgl are not set, you then have to set them manually, see [base image definition files](https://github.com/CSCfi/singularity-recipes/tree/main/visualization) for details.\n\nTo easily start the program, create a `.desktop` [shortcut file](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#recognized-keys) in the `$HOME/Desktop` directory in Puhti. An icon then appears on the desktop which will start the program in the container.\n\nExample `blender.desktop` file which starts the example container provided in the next section.\n```\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Blender\nTerminal=true\nExec=apptainer run --nv /path_to_image/vgl_blender.sif\n```\n\n### Building your own images\nTo build containers for VGL applications yourself, you can use one of the base images provided by CSC as a base. These images have both graphics driver and VirtualGL already installed, which are necessary to use GPU in graphical applications running remotely.\n\nBase images available can be found from the path `/appl/opt/vis/vgl-base-images/` in Puhti.\n\nFor details of how the base images work, see their [definition files](https://github.com/CSCfi/singularity-recipes/tree/main/visualization).\n\nHere is a commented example definition file that installs blender on top of the base image.\n\n```\nBootstrap: localimage\nFrom: /appl/opt/vis/vgl-base-images/ubuntu/22.04.sif \n\n%environment\n\t# Specify path to the binary that we want to run on start\n\texport VGL_APPLICATION=/opt/blender-3.6.0/blender\n%post\n\t# When building with fakeroot without namespaces we cannot modify users or groups during the installation so we replace problematic binaries with dummies and hope that everything will still work\n\tcp /usr/bin/true /usr/sbin/groupadd\n\tcp /usr/bin/true /usr/sbin/useradd\n\n\t# Install blender dependencies, to figure out which libraries are required use ldd, read error messages etc.\n\tapt-get install -y libxi6 libxrender1 libxkbcommon0 \\\n\t                   libxkbcommon-x11-0 libsm6 libice6\n\n\t# Install Blender binary\n\tcd /opt\n\tBLENDER_VERSION=3.6.0\n\twget https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/blender/release/Blender$(echo \"$BLENDER_VERSION\" | cut -d. -f1,2)/blender-$BLENDER_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.xz\n\ttar xf blender-$BLENDER_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.xz\n\tmv blender-$BLENDER_VERSION-linux-x64 /opt/blender-$BLENDER_VERSION\n\trm blender-$BLENDER_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.xz\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALPINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alpine is a Linux distribution that works with specific versions as indicated, but not with versions 3.6-3.19)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMALINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AlmaLinux is a Linux distribution that supports versions 8-9)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEBIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Debian is a Linux distribution that supports versions from Buster to Trixie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CentOS is a Linux distribution that supports version 7)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSUSE/LEAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenSUSE/Leap is a Linux distribution with varying support: versions 15.0 and 15.6 are not supported, whereas versions 15.1-15.5 are supported)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REDHAT/UBI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RedHat/UBI is a Linux distribution that supports versions 8-9)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution that supports versions from 16.04 to 22.04)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment where users can run GPU-accelerated applications in containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCELERATED VISUALIZATION<|>EVENT<|>Accelerated Visualization refers to running programs that use GPU for enhanced performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUALGL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VirtualGL is a tool that allows the use of a GPU in graphical applications running remotely)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides base images for GPU usage, which include graphics driver and VirtualGL installed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender is a 3D creation suite that can be installed on top of a base image provided by CSC for GPU-accelerated applications)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ACCELERATED VISUALIZATION<|>Puhti supports running Accelerated Visualization applications using containers<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUALGL<|>ACCELERATED VISUALIZATION<|>VirtualGL is necessary for running GPU-accelerated graphical applications remotely, which is part of Accelerated Visualization<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>VIRTUALGL<|>CSC provides base images with VirtualGL installed for GPU usage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>BLENDER<|>CSC's base images can be used to install Blender for GPU-accelerated applications<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
