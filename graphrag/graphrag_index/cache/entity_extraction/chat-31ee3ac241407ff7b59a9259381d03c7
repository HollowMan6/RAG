How to speed up jobs\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 2\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/throughput/hyperqueue.html\n---\n\n# Using HyperQueue and local disk to process many small files efficiently\n\n> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that\n\n- you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n- your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\n## Overview\n\n💬 [HyperQueue](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/hyperqueue/) is a tool for efficient\nsub-node task scheduling and well suited for task farming and running\nembarrassingly parallel jobs.\n\n💬 In this example, we have more than 4000 files which we want to convert to\nanother format.\n\n- Each file contains a [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system)\n  string (an ASCII notation encoding the two-dimensional structure of a\n  molecule) which we want to convert into a three-dimensional coordinate\n  format.\n- The computational cost of each of the conversions is expected to be\n  comparable.\n- Since the workflow involves many small files, we will also demonstrate the\n  usage of the fast local disk to avoid stressing the parallel file system.\n\n### The workflow of this exercise\n\n1. Download the files from Allas.\n2. Decompress the files to `$LOCAL_SCRATCH`.\n3. Convert each `.smi` file to a three-dimensional `.sdf` molecular file\n   format.\n4. Archive and compress the output files and move them back to `/scratch`.\n\n## Download the input files\n\n1. Create and enter a suitable scratch directory on Puhti (replace `<project>`\n   with your CSC project, e.g. `project_2001234`):\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER/hq-example\n   cd /scratch/<project>/$USER/hq-example\n   ```\n\n2. Download the input files representing molecules initially obtained from the\n   [ChEMBL database](https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/downloads):\n  \n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/smiles.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n## Create a HyperQueue batch script\n\n💬 We will use [Open Babel](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/openbabel/) to convert the\nSMILES strings into a three-dimensional `.sdf` coordinate format.\n\n☝🏻 Multiple files can be converted using the batch conversion mode of Open\nBabel. For 4000+ files this would, however, take more than an hour.\nSubmitting each conversion as a separate Slurm job is also a bad idea since\neach conversion takes just a few seconds. Running many short jobs will degrade\nthe performance of the scheduler for all users.\n\n💡 [HyperQueue](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/hyperqueue/) is a program that allows\nus to schedule sub-node tasks *within* a Slurm allocation. One can think of\nHyperQueue as a \"Slurm within a Slurm\", or a so-called \"meta-scheduler\", which\nallows us to leverage embarrassing parallelism without overloading Slurm by\nlooping `srun` or `sbatch` commands.\n\n1. Copy the following script into a file `hq.sh` using, e.g., `nano`:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   #SBATCH --partition=small\n   #SBATCH --account=<project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   #SBATCH --nodes=1\n   #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40\n   #SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n   #SBATCH --gres=nvme:1\n \n   module load hyperqueue openbabel\n \n   # Specify a location for the HyperQueue server\n   export HQ_SERVER_DIR=${PWD}/hq-server-${SLURM_JOB_ID}\n   mkdir -p \"${HQ_SERVER_DIR}\"\n \n   # Start the server in the background (&) and wait until it has started\n   hq server start &\n   until hq job list &>/dev/null ; do sleep 1 ; done\n \n   # Start the workers in the background and wait for them to start\n   srun --exact --cpu-bind=none --mpi=none hq worker start --cpus=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} &\n   hq worker wait \"${SLURM_NTASKS}\"\n \n   # Extract the input files to the local disk and cd there\n   tar -xf smiles.tar.gz -C $LOCAL_SCRATCH\n   cd $LOCAL_SCRATCH/smiles\n \n   # Submit each Open Babel conversion as a separate HyperQueue job\n   for f in *.smi ; do\n       hq submit --stdout=none --stderr=none obabel $f -O ${f%.*}.sdf --gen3d best &\n   done\n \n   # Wait for all jobs to finish, then shut down the workers and server\n   hq job wait all\n   hq worker stop all\n   hq server stop\n \n   # Archive and compress the output .sdf files and copy the package back to /scratch\n   tar -czf sdf.tar.gz *.sdf\n   cp sdf.tar.gz $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR\n   ```\n\n2.
