In many cases, using Allas efficiently requires that the user know the features of both the object storage system and the software or protocol used to manage the data in Allas.\n\nFor users who simply want to use Allas for storing data that is in the CSC computing environment, CSC provides a set of commands for managing and moving data between the CSC computing environment and Allas:\n\n\n| a-command | help text | Function |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [a-put](#a-put)| [help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-put.md)|Upload a file or directory to Allas |\n| [a-check](#a-check) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-check.md)| Check if all the objects, that a-put should have created, are found in Allas |\n| [a-list](#a-list) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-list.md)| List buckets and objects in Allas |\n| [a-publish](#a-publish) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-publish.md)|Upload a file to Allas into a bucket that allows public access over the internet |\n| [a-flip](#a-flip) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-flip.md)|Upload a file temporarily to Allas into a bucket that allows public access over the internet |\n| [a-get](#a-get) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-get.md)| Download a stored dataset (object) from Allas |\n| [a-find](#a-find)|[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-find.md)|Search and locate data uploaded with *a-put* |\n| [a-delete](#a-delete) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-delete.md)| Delete an object in Allas |\n| [a-info](#a-info) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-info.md)| Display information about an object in Allas |\n| [a-access](#a-access) |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-access.md)| Control access permissions of a bucket in Allas |\n| a-stream |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-stream.md)|Stream the content of an object to standard output |\n| a-encrypt |[help](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/a-encrypt.md)|Make an encrypted copy of an object uploaded in Allas |\n\nIn addition to the above commands, there are separate tools for other purposes:\n\n * __allas_conf__ : Set up and open a connection to Allas\n * [__allas-backup__](./a_backup.md) : Create a backup copy of a local dataset in a backup repository in Allas.\n * __allas-mount__ : Mount a bucket in allas to be used as a read-only directory in the local environment.\n * __allas-health-check__ : Check the integrity of over 5 GB objects in Allas.\n * [__allas-dir-to-bucket__](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/help/allas-dir-to-bucket.md) : copy a local file or directory to Allas. Parallel upload processes are used for over 5GB files.\n \nIf you use the a-commands outside the supercomputers, check the [allas-cli-utils documentation](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/blob/master/README.md) for how to install these tools.\n\nBelow we discuss briefly of the most frequetly used features of a-commands. New features are added to a-commands every now and then and they may not be covered in the examples below. Use the help option `--help` to check the command specific information. For example:\n```text\na-put --help\n```\n\n\n# Example: Saving data from scratch directory to Allas\n\n## Opening a connection\n\nIn order to use these tools in Puhti and Mahti, first load a-commands:\n```text\nmodule load allas\n```\nThen open a connection to Allas:\n```text\nallas-conf\n```\nThe connection remains open for eight hours. You can rerun the _allas-conf_ command at any time\nto extend the validity of the connection for eight more hours or to switch to another Allas \nproject. \n\nBy default, _allas-conf_ lists your projects that have access to Allas, but if you know the name of the project, you\ncan also give it as an argument:\n```text\nallas-conf project_201234\n```\nNote that the Allas project does not need to be the same as the project you are using in Puhti or Mahti.\n\nIf you are running big, multistep processes (e.g. batch jobs), it may be that your data management pipeline takes more than eight hours. In those cases you can add option `-k` to the `allas-conf` command.\n```text\nallas-conf -k\n```\nWith this option on, the password is stored into environment variable OS_PASSWORD. A-commands recognize this environment variable and when executed, automatically refresh the current Allas connection.\n\n## Copying data between Puhti scratch directory and Allas\n\nCopying data from directory _/scratch/project\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
