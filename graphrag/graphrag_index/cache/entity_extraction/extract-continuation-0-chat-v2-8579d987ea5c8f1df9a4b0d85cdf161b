This way, one can schedule MPI tasks at a node-level\ngranularity.\n\n### Automatic worker allocation\n\nWe recommend avoiding using the automatic allocator. It automatically generates\nand submits batch scripts to start workers, which adds unnecessary complexity.\nAlso, the automatically generated batch scripts have some issues and could be more\nflexible.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Using HyperQueue and local disk to process many files](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/throughput/hyperqueue.html)\n* [Farming Gaussian jobs with sbatch-hq](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/throughput/gaussian_hq.html)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HQ, short for HyperQueue, is a tool for managing and distributing computational tasks across a cluster of computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a job scheduling system for Linux clusters, widely used in high-performance computing environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snakemake is a workflow management system that helps to create and manage complex workflows in bioinformatics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXTFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nextflow is a workflow framework that simplifies the writing of complex distributed computational pipelines)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HQ<|>SLURM<|>HQ can be used in conjunction with SLURM to manage computational tasks on a cluster<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HQ<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>HQ can be used as a cluster executor in Snakemake workflows, replacing traditional schedulers like SLURM<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HQ<|>NEXTFLOW<|>HQ can serve as an executor for Nextflow workflows, offering an alternative to traditional HPC job schedulers<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
