On this page we focus on Mahti-specific topics.\n\n!!! Note\n    Full nodes are allocated for jobs, with the exception of\n    [interactive jobs](interactive-usage.md#sinteractive-on-mahti),\n    [see also below](#using-interactive-partition-for-non-parallel-pre-or-post-processing).\n    Many options also work differently on Mahti compared to Puhti, so it is not\n    advisable to copy scripts from Puhti to Mahti without appropriate\n    modifications.\n\n    Note also that only Mahti GPU nodes have NVMe disk on compute nodes.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Basic MPI batch jobs\n\nAn example of a simple MPI batch job script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=myTest\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=medium\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128\n\nmodule load myprog/1.2.3\n\nsrun myprog -i input -o output\n```\n\nSpecify the exact number of nodes and number of tasks per node  with\n`--nodes` and `--ntasks-per-node`, respectively. Use all 128 cores in\nthe node.\n\n!!! Note\n    - MPI processes should **not** be started with _mpirun_ or _mpiexec_. Use `srun` instead.\n    - appropriate software module has to be loaded in the batch job script for the submission to\n      work properly.\n\n## Hybrid batch jobs\n\nAs explained for [Puhti](creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#hybrid-batch-jobs), hybrid\nparallelization can run multiple OpenMP threads per MPI task. In addition to the\n`--ntasks-per-node=X` one needs to set `--cpus-per-task=Y`. The default is one cpu\n(thread) per task. To use all physical cores in a Mahti node choose `X * Y = 128`,\nlike in [this example](example-job-scripts-mahti.md#mpi-openmp).\nIf you are using simultaneous multithreading (see section below) your should use `X * Y = 256`\n\nThe optimal ratio between the number of tasks and cores per tasks varies for each\nprogram and job input. Testing is required to find the right combination for your\napplication. You can find some examples for\n[CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md#performance-notes) and\n[NAMD](../../apps/namd.md#performance-considerations).\n\n## Hybrid batch jobs with simultaneous multithreading (SMT)\n\nMahti is configured so that it doesn't place any theads to the logical cores\nby default. SMT support can be enabled with `--hint=multithread` option.\nWhen this option is used, it is important to use the `--ntasks-per-node=X` and\n`--cpus-per-task=Y` so that `X * Y = 256`. Failing to do so will leave some of the\nactual physical cores unallocated and performance will be suboptimal.\n[Example batch job script for SMT](example-job-scripts-mahti.md#mpi-openmp-with-simultaneous-multithreading).\n\n## GPU batch jobs\n\nMahti has 24 GPU nodes and each of them has four Nvidia Ampere A100 GPUs and a local 3.8 TB Nvme drive.\nThe GPUs are available on the `gputest` ,`gpusmall` and `gpumedium` partitions using the option:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:<number_of_gpus_per_node>\n```\n\nMahti's `gpusmall` partition supports only one or two GPU jobs. So the maximum is `--gres=gpu:a100:2`\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --partition=gpusmall\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:1\n```\n\nIn Mahti's `gpusmall` partition there are also A100 GPUs that have been sliced into smaller a100_1g.5gb GPUs\nwith one seventh of the compute and memory capacity of a full A100 GPU. For each GPU slice you can reserve\nat most 4 CPU cores and for each GPU slice the job is allocated 17.5 GiB of memory. Also note that you can reserve\nat most one GPU slice per job. The GPU slices are available on `gpusmall` using the options:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --partition=gpusmall\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100_1g.5gb:1\n```\n\nMahti's `gpumedium` partition supports multi-GPU jobs with four GPUs per compute node.\nThe example below will allocate four GPUs per compute node, so eight GPUs altogether:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --partition=gpumedium\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:4\n```\n\nThe `gpumedium` is the only gpu partition where more than one compute node is available (maximum number for the `--nodes` flag is six).\n\nThe `gputest` partition is for short test runs. Maximum for the `--time` flag is 15 minutes and one job per account can be run in a RUNNING state.\nMaximum for the  `--nodes` flag is one but all four GPUs on a node can be allocated for a test job.\n\nIn Mahti fast local storage is only available on GPU nodes and it is good for IO intensive applications.\nRequest local storage using the `--gres` flag in the job submission:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:<local_storage_space_per_node>\n```\n\nThe amount\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
