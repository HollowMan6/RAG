In particular MPI\nand Horovod are not expected to work anymore with these modules.

It is recommended to use Python virtual\nenvironments. See [our Python documentation for more information on\nhow to install packages\nyourself](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).\nIf you think that some important package should be included in the\nmodule provided by CSC, please [contact our\nservicedesk](../support/contact.md).\n\nAll modules are based on containers using Apptainer (previously known\nas Singularity). Wrapper scripts have been provided so that common\ncommands such as `python`, `python3`, `pip` and `pip3` should work as\nnormal. For other commands, you need to prefix them with\n`apptainer_wrapper exec`, for example `apptainer_wrapper exec\nhuggingface-cli`. For more information, see [CSC's general\ninstructions on how to run Apptainer\ncontainers](../computing/containers/run-existing.md).\n\nSome modules support [Horovod](https://horovod.ai/), which is our recommended\nframework for multi-node jobs, i.e., jobs needing more than 4\nGPUs.
