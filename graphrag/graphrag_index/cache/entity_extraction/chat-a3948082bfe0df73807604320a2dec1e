This is for example used when the internal network between nodes in the cluster is not considered secure enough and we still want the Route to control the certificates that the client will get. Also in some rare applications is not possible to disable TLS in the Pods.\n\n![Route Options](../img/route-modes.drawio.svg)\n\nA Route can also be configured to provide a HTTP/302 redirection from port `80` to `443`. It is also possible to serve the same content in both ports, or to not serve anything at all in the un secure `80` port.\n\nAn important limitation for Rahti 1 is that **only the HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 ports are exposed for incoming traffic**, and they only can serve **HTTPD protocol requests**. Internally to a namespace, any port and protocol is supported, this means we can connect an application to a database with no issues, but we will never be able to expose that database to outside traffic. This is due to the fact that the same incoming virtual IP is shared with all the incoming traffic in Rahti's HAProxy load balancers. [Name-based virtual hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting#Name-based) are used to redirect the traffic to the correct Route. Other protocols that are not HTTPD, do not have this feature and will need a dedicated IP/port pair to work.\n\nRahti 1 provides a range of pre-created domain names, `XXXX.rahtiapp.fi` where `XXXX` can be any combination of letters, numbers and dashes. These pre-created domain names also come with a valid TLS certificate.\n\n```bash\n$ dig hola.rahtiapp.fi CNAME | grep 'ANSWER SECTION' -A 1\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nhola.rahtiapp.fi.\t113\tIN\tCNAME\trahtiapp.fi.\n\n$ dig moi.rahtiapp.fi CNAME | grep 'ANSWER SECTION' -A 1\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nmoi.rahtiapp.fi.\t96\tIN\tCNAME\trahtiapp.fi.\n\n$ dig rahtiapp.fi A |  grep 'ANSWER SECTION' -A 1\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nrahtiapp.fi.\t\t328\tIN\tA\t193.167.189.101\n```\n\nEvery single pre-created domain name is configured as a `CNAME` that points to `rahtiapp..fi`, which itself points to one of the HAProxy load balancers.\n\nAny other domain name is possible, but the DNS and the certificates must be managed by the customer.\n\n* For the DNS, a `CNAME` pointing to `rahtiapp.fi` or in cases that this is not possible, directly the `A` record containing the IP of `rahtiapp.fi` has to be configured. The way this needs to be configured depends on the register of the DNS record.\n\n* Any certificate provider can be used, like for example use the free certificates provided by the [Let's Encrypt controller](../tutorials/custom-domain.md#lets-encrypt).\n\nAnother aspect of routes is the IP white listing feature, ie: only allowing a range of IPs to access the route. This is controlled by creating an annotation in the Route object with the key `haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist`, and by setting the value to a space separated list of IPs and or IP ranges.\n\n* This first example will white list a range of IPs (`193.166.[0-255].[1-254]`):\n\n```bash\noc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist='193.166.0.0/16'\n```\n\n* This other example will white list only a specific IP:\n\n```bash\noc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist='188.184.9.236'\n```\n\n* And this example will combine both:\n\n```bash\noc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist='193.166.0.0/15 193.167.189.25'\n```\n\n## Egress IPs\n\nThe IP for all outgoing customer traffic is `193.167.189.25`. Any pod that runs in Rahti 1 will use by default this IP to reach anything located outside Rahti 1 or a Route. It is possible, for selected namespaces that need it, to configure a dedicated IP. Each request is reviewed individually due to the fact that there is a limited pool of virtual IPs available.\n\n!!! warning \"egress IP may change\"\n\n    The egress IP of Rahti 1 might change in the future. For example, if several versions of Rahti 1 are run in parallel each will have a different IP. Or if a major change in the underlining network infrastructure happens.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
