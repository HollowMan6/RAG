During the compilation of software, it is common to need a compiler, several library dependencies, and intermediate objects that will not be needed during the execution of the program. Multistage builds allow you to define two or more docker build stages in the same `Dockerfile`. They will be executed in order one after the other, and each \"stage\" will be able to copy files from the previous ones. This way, we can easily and in the same build process, build the software and then keep only the files that we actually need for the execution.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst create a new go project or have an existing go initialize project.\n\n* To initialize a new go project as an example:\n\n```sh\ngo mod init example.com/go-server\n```\n\nTake this `Dockerfile`:\n\n* `Dockerfile`:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM golang:1.18.3-stretch as builder\n\nRUN mkdir -p /go/src/server\nWORKDIR /go/src/server\n\nCOPY go.mod go.sum ./\nRUN go mod download && go mod verify \n\nCOPY . .\n\nRUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build server.go\n\nFROM alpine:edge\n\nRUN mkdir /app\nCOPY --from=builder /go/src/server/server /app/server\nCMD [\"/app/server\"]\n```\n\nand this code (golang):\n\n* `server.go`:\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"strings\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"github.com/pborman/uuid\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/\", func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        uuidWithHyphen := uuid.NewRandom()\n        uuid := strings.Replace(uuidWithHyphen.String(), \"-\", \"\", -1)\n        fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Welcome to my website!\\n\")\n        fmt.Fprintf(w, uuid)\n    })\n\n    fmt.Print(\"Starting server in port 8080...\\n\")\n\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n}\n```\nThen run `go mod tidy`, which will download all the dependencies that are required in your source files and update `go.mod` file with that dependency. In this case it will download `github.com/pborman/uuid`.\n\nThe `dockerfile` can be divided into two parts (or stages), each starting by the `FROM` instruction:\n\n1. `FROM golang:1.18.3-stretch as builder`, uses the official golang image containing everything we need to compile the code. It is labeled as `builder`. We copy `go.mod and go.sum` and download the package dependencies to the \"working directory\". We copy the whole \"working directory\", including the code with `COPY . .`, and finally compile the code with `RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build server.go`.\n2. `FROM alpine:edge`, uses the minimal distribution `alpine`. In the line `COPY --from=builder /go/src/server/server /app/server` the compiled program and only the compiled program is copied from the previous stage (`build`).\n\nIn order to test this build process, put the two files in the same directory and name them `Dockerfile` and `server.go`. Then run the command:\n\n```sh\ndocker build . -t go-server\n```\n\nThis will produce the image called `go-server:latest`. To check the size of the image just run:\n\n```sh\n$ docker images go-server\nREPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE\ngo-server    latest    173c922261a3   16 minutes ago   12.1MB\n```\n\nit should give you approximately 12MB, which is more than half (~7MB) is the compiled code.\n\nIf you pull the image `golang:1.18.3-stretch` (the one we used for building the code) and check its size, you will see that it is approximately `890 MB`.\n\n```sh\n$ docker images golang:1.18.3-stretch\nREPOSITORY   TAG              IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE\ngolang       1.18.3-stretch   6ee1deda35bd   12 days ago   890 MB\n```\n\nThis same small image (`go-server:latest`) is of course also achievable by other methods. You can build the code outside of docker and then copy it to the `alpine` image. You can mount the code directory into the build image, build it and then again copy the compiled product into the `alpine` image. But none of these methods are as easy and compact as this one.\n\n## Usage in Rahti 2\n\nIn order to test this in Rahti 2, one only needs to login in Rahti 2, select the correct project, and run:\n\n```sh\noc new-build https://github.com/cscfi/multi-stage-build.git\n\n```\n\n**NOTE**: The code must be in a git repository and Rahti 2 must be able to clone it.\n\nThe end result will be an image called `multi-stage-build` stored in the internal Rahti 2 registry of the project you selected. This image can then be used in a Rahti 2 deployment using the image stream option when deploying an image.\n\n## Upstream documentation\n\n* [Use multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
