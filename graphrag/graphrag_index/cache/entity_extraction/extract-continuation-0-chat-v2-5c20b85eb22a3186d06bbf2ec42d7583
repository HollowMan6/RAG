This means that the platform can be configured to add more copies of an application (scale up) when the current copies are consuming too much CPU and/or Memory, and to remove copies of the application (scale down) when the consumption of CPU and/or memory is too low and a lower amount of copies can cope with the current load. \n\n!!! info \"Horizontal/Vertical scaling\"\n\n    Horizontal scaling is when more copies or replicas of an application are added. For Kubernetes this means more Pods running with the same container and parameters. For virtual machines this means to add more virtual machines with the same flavor and image.\n\n    Vertical scaling is when more resources are added to the current copy. For Kubernetes this means setting higher CPU or memory limits. For virtual machines it means to recreate the machine with a bigger flavor with more CPU or memory.\n\nThe obvious utility of this is to allow automatically and dynamically optimize the resources consumed. It lowers the cost of maintaining an application that will only have occasionally high load. The response time for scaling up is in the realm of seconds, and when tuned in properly, it can allow a seamless experience for the users of the application. \n\n## Setup\n\nFor doing this, first we need a `Deployment`. Any deployment will work, but you can use this example that deploys a dummy application: \n\n**Note:** Remember to [login in Rahti 2](../rahti2/usage/cli.md#how-to-login-with-oc) first\n\n```sh\necho \"apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: httpd\n  replicas: 4\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: httpd\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: httpd\n          image: docker.io/lvarin/oom-killer\n          command:\n           - /app/app.py\n           - '10'\n          ports:\n            - containerPort: 8080\n\" | oc create -f -\n```\n\nThe deployment should now spin up 4 copies of the same `Pod`. We will later configure it to lower or increase the number of Pods based on resource consuption.\n\n### Add resources limits\n\n![Actions>EditResourceLimits](../img/editResourceLimits.png){ align=right }\n\nThe next step is to set resource limits for CPU and Memory. This is the maximum amount of CPU and memory that each Pod will be able to use. From the Deployment page, go to **Actions > Edit resource limits**\n\nYou have to set a limit (per Pod) for CPU and memory. It is not necessary to fill up the \"Request\" field.\n\n\nFor this example, we will set:\n\n* `1` CPU limit.\n* `1` Gi memory limit.\n\n![Edit ResourceLimits](../img/editResourceLimitsDialog.png)\n\n### Add the HorizontalAutoscaler\n\nOnce the Pod limits are set, you can now add the Horizontal auto-scaler. From the Deployment page, go to **Actions > Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler**.\n\n![Actions>AddHorizontalAutoscaler](../img/addHorizontalAutoscaler.png){ align=right }\n\nFirst set the **maximum** and **minimum** number of replicas. In general, one will leave the minimum to 1, and set the maximum to a value to a \"fair share\" of the total quota. For example, if you have a total quota of 20 Pods, and one single Deployment, the maximum should be set to 20, to use all the quota available. But if you have two deployments sharing the same name space, the maximum should be set to 10 each.\n\nAfter the minimum and maximum are set, we need to setup the % of resource usage that will be needed to trigger an scale up. One or both of the two resources (CPU and memory) can be set. What limit and of what resource depends on ghe application you are running. Some applications are more CPU usage intensive, some are memory usage intensive, others are both. In practise, it is an iterative process for tunning the parameters. \n\nWhen the usage of the resources configured is surpassed, a new replica will be created. For example, we setup a 50% of memory with a limit of 1Gi. When the usage of memory reaches and surpasses the 500MB mark, a new replica will be created, doubling the total memory available. This scale up will continue meanwhile the total memory usage is more than 50% of the memory available.\n\nOn the hand, an scale down will happen when the extra capacity is no longer needed, i.e.: When by removing one replica, the total memory used will not be more that 50% of the total available after the scale down.\n\n![Add Horizontal Pod Autoscaler dialog](../img/addHorizontalPodAutoscalerDialog.png)\n\nFor this example we will setup:\n\n* `1` as the Minimum number of Pods.\n* `4` as the Maximum number of Pods.\n* `50`% of memory utilization.\n\nWe will not touch the CPU utilization. \n\n## Test and monitor\n\nAfter some minutes, we should have only one single Pod with almost zero CPU usage and 100MB of memory usage. The autoscaler waits up to 10 minutes to delete Pods to avoid flapping, see below for more information. You can check this in the `Pods` page (**Project > Pods** in the Developer page).\n\n![Pods](../img/podsAutoscaler.png)\n\n!!! info \"Using the CLI\"\n\n    You can use the command line interface to get the current status of the autoscaler:\n    ```\n    $ oc get HorizontalPodAutoscaler example   \n    NAME      REFERENCE            TARGETS          MINPODS\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 2 is a platform that allows automatic horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU and Memory consumption)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPLOYMENT<|>EVENT<|>A deployment in Rahti 2 context refers to the process of deploying an application, which can be automatically scaled up or down based on resource consumption)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HORIZONTAL SCALING<|>EVENT<|>Horizontal scaling involves adding more copies or replicas of an application to handle increased load)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VERTICAL SCALING<|>EVENT<|>Vertical scaling involves adding more resources to the existing copies of an application to increase its capacity)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HORIZONTALPODAUTOSCALER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool within Rahti 2 that automatically adjusts the number of pods in a deployment based on observed CPU and memory usage)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>DEPLOYMENT<|>Rahti 2 supports the deployment of applications with features like auto-scaling<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HORIZONTAL SCALING<|>RAHTI 2<|>Rahti 2 utilizes horizontal scaling as part of its auto-scaling capabilities<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VERTICAL SCALING<|>RAHTI 2<|>Rahti 2 supports vertical scaling as an option for resource optimization<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HORIZONTALPODAUTOSCALER<|>DEPLOYMENT<|>The HorizontalPodAutoscaler is used to automatically scale deployments in Rahti 2 based on resource usage<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HORIZONTAL SCALING<|>HORIZONTALPODAUTOSCALER<|>Horizontal scaling is a key function enabled by the HorizontalPodAutoscaler in Rahti 2<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VERTICAL SCALING<|>HORIZONTALPODAUTOSCALER<|>Although primarily focused on horizontal scaling, the concept of resource adjustment by the HorizontalPodAutoscaler indirectly relates to vertical scaling principles<|>4)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
