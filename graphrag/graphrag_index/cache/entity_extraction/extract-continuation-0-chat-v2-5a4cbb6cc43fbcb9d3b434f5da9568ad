For a list\nof new features, see the [Schrödinger website](https://www.schrodinger.com/releases/new-features).\n\n## Gromacs 2021 now default version, 7.2.2022\n\n[Gromacs 2021.5](../../apps/gromacs.md) has been installed on Puhti and Mahti and set as the\ndefault module (gromacs-env).\n\n## Direct usage of Conda deprecated, 4.2.2022\n\nCSC has [deprecated the direct usage of Conda\ninstallations](../tutorials/conda.md) on our supercomputers' (Puhti and Mahti)\nshared file systems.\n\n## Python Data 3.9-2, 20.1.2022\n\nA new version of [Python Data](../../apps/python-data.md) is now available with\n`module load python-data/3.9-2` on both Puhti and Mahti. It includes the most\nrecent versions of Scikit-learn, SciPy, Pandas, JupyterLab and many other\npopular data analytics and machine learning packages for Python 3.9.\n\n## Python Data default module now uses Singularity, 26.11.2021\n\nThe default version of the `python-data` module has been changed to `3.9-1`.\nThis means that if you have been simply doing `module load python-data` you will\nnow get this new version automatically. This version has been installed using\nSingularity which should make loading times much faster. Thanks to wrapper\nscripts this change should be mostly invisible to users. If you still encounter\nany problems, don't hesitate to report them to [CSC's service\ndesk](../contact.md).\n\n## Schrödinger Maestro 2021.4, 24.11.2021\n\nSchrödinger Maestro 2021.4 has been installed on Puhti and set as the default module.\n\n## PyTorch 1.10, 10.11.2021\n\nPyTorch 1.10.0 is now available in the `pytorch/1.10` module on Puhti and Mahti,\nand has been set as the default module. See the [official PyTorch 1.10 release\nnotes](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.10-released/) for more details. CSC's\nmodule has the following improvements:\n\n- Jupyter Lab now works (previously only regular Jupyter Notebook UI worked)\n- [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) support built in (experimental support)\n\n## TensorFlow 2.7, 9.11.2021\n\nTensorFlow 2.7.0 is now available in the `tensorflow/2.7` module on Puhti and\nMahti, and has been set as the default module. See the [TensorFlow 2.7 release\nnotes on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.7.0/)\nfor more details.

The [extended\nMaestro instructions](../tutorials/power-maestro.md#quantum-espresso) have been appended with a\nsection on how to speed up Quantum Espresso jobs. A bug in the script that generates the\n`schrodinger.hosts` file has also been fixed by setting the `parallel` HOST entry to use the\n`large` Slurm partition as intended.\n\n## Turbomole 7.5.1, 25.8.2021\n\nTurbomole 7.5.1 is now available and the default module on Puhti. The most important change\nwith this version is that the `ricc2` module for performing 2nd order approximate coupled\ncluster calculations works appropriately, while older versions on Puhti have been recently\nreported to suffer from numerical instabilities. These issues do not apply to TM v7.5 installed\non Mahti.\n\n## CP2K 8.2, 13.8.2021\n\nCP2K version 8.2 has been installed on Mahti and is available with `module load cp2k/8.2-omp`.\nThis requires that `gcc/10.3.0` and `openmpi/4.1.0` are first loaded. Version `7.1-elpa` will\nremain the default module for now, but will be changed to `8.2-omp` in the near future (despite\nthe name, the ELPA diagonalization library is also linked to the new 8.2 version).
