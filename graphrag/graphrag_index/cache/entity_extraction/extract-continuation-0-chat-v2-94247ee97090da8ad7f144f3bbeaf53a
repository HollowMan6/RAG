This unique machine with a public IP is a gateway to the internal network.  \n\nHere is a schema:  \n![jumphost-schema](../img/jumphost_schema.png)\n\n\n## How to create a jumphost?\nYou can find a template in our GitHub repo: [jumphost CSC](https://github.com/CSCfi/openshift-jumphost-example). Read carefully the instructions provided in the repo.  \nKeep in mind that we provide a basic template. You can clone and edit it for fulfilling your needs.\n\n## Explanations  \nTwo extra folders need to be created: `files` and `keys`.  \n\nIn the `files` folder, you need to copy your public key used to connect to the instances. It can be the public key you use every time in cPouta or it can be a new key. Don't forget to upload it to your cPouta project.  \n\nIn the `keys` folder, you need to copy all the public keys of the users you want to authorize to connect to the different instances. Ansible will look to the `keys` folder.  \n\nHere is the part of the code:  \n```yaml\n- name: Set authorized key taken from files\n  authorized_key:\n    user: \"ubuntu\"\n    state: present\n    key: \"{{ lookup('file', item) }}\"\n  with_fileglob: \"keys/*\"\n  tags:\n    - keys\n```\n\nIt means to deploy `Ubuntu` images. If you want to use it with `CentOS` machines, don't forget to edit the file `all.yaml` and the values of `os_image` and `user`.  \n\nTo run the playbook, type this command:  \n```sh\nansible-playbook main.yaml\n```\nIt will prompt you to enter the name of the network you want to use.  \n\nLook at the `README.md` file in the GitHub repository for more details.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JUMPHOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A jumphost in an infrastructure allows access from the external to several machines without giving them a public IP.
