Your own public key (`mykey.pub`) was created in the previous step, and the public key of research group A (`groupA.pub`) we have received somehow (e.g. via email). To encrypt a file you use `crypt4gh encrypt` command:\n\n      ```bash\n      $ crypt4gh encrypt --recipient_pk mykey.pub --recipient_pk groupA.pub <dog.jpg >dog.jpg.c4gh\n      ```\n\n      The `crypt4gh` command uses only standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) so you must use shell redirections: `<` denotes an input file and `>` and denotes an output file, hence `<dog.jpg` reads in a file called `dog.jpg` and `>dog.jpg.c4gh` writes out an encrypted file named `dog.jpg.c4gh`.\n\n\n4. Decrypt a file\n\n      To decrypt a file you will need a private key which corresponds to one of the public keys used in encryption phase. Let's assume in our example that the research group A is decrypting a file you've sent them. To decrypt a file they use `crypt4gh decrypt` command:\n\n      ```bash\n      crypt4gh decrypt --sk groupA.sec <dog.jpg.c4gh >dog.jpg\n      Passphrase for groupA.sec: \n      ```\n\n      where `--sk groupA.sec` is a corresponding private key to one of the public keys used in the encryption. The `crypt4gh` command uses only standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) so you must use shell redirections: `<` denotes an input file and `>` and denotes an output file, hence `<dog.jpg.c4gh` reads in an encrypted file called `dog.jpg.c4gh` and `>dog.jpg` writes out a decrypted file named `dog.jpg`.\n\n      The command will ask the user to enter the password (passphrase) of your private key. For security reasons the password is not displayed when you type it.\n\n    !!! Note\n        In case you are decrypting the file in SD Desktop and the CSC Sensitive Data public key has been used in encryption, decryption will be done automatically, and you do not need to specify any decryption keys.\n    \n      If you need to decrypt a large number of files, please check the tutorial [Decrypting all files in a directory](./tutorials/decrypt-directory.md).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crypt4GH is a tool used for encrypting and decrypting files, utilizing public and private keys for secure data transfer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH GROUP A<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A research group that has shared its public key for secure file exchange and possesses the corresponding private key for decryption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOG.JPG<|>EVENT<|>A file named dog.jpg is encrypted and decrypted using Crypt4GH commands)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESEARCH GROUP A<|>CRYPT4GH<|>Research Group A uses Crypt4GH for encrypting and decrypting files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOG.JPG<|>CRYPT4GH<|>The file dog.jpg is encrypted and decrypted using Crypt4GH commands<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
