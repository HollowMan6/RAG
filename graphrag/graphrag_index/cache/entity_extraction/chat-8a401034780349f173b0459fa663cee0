If you want\nmore information about the full configuration of EasyBuild, you can execute\n\n```bash\n$ eb --show-config\n```\n\nEasyBuild is configured so that it searches in the user repository and two\nrepositories on the system. The current directory is not part of the default\nsearch path but can be easily added with a command line option. By default,\nEasyBuild will not install dependencies of a package and fail instead, if one or\nmore of the dependencies cannot be found, but that is also easily changed on\nthe command line. \n\n### Step 3: Install the package\n\nTo show how to actually install a package, we continue with our\n`GROMACS-2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU.eb` example.\n\nIf all needed EasyBuild recipes are in one of the\nrepositories, all you need to do to install the\npackage is to run\n\n```bash\n$ eb GROMACS-2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU.eb -r\n```\n\nThe `-r` tells EasyBuild to also install dependencies that may not yet be\ninstalled.\n\nIf the `GROMACS-2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU.eb` would not have been\nin a repository, but in the current directory or one of its subdirectories,\nyou could use \n\n```bash\n$ eb GROMACS-2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU.eb -r .\n```\n\nThe only difference is the dot added to the `-r` flag. This adds the current directory to\nthe front of the search path. In general, it doesn't hurt to always use the dot with `-r`,\nbut performance may suffer if the current directory contains a lot of subdirectories they\nwill all be searched for EasyBuild recipes.\n\nThe `-r .` or `-r` flags should be omitted if you\nwant full control and install dependency by dependency before installing the\npackage (which may be handy if building right away fails).\n\nIf you now type `module avail` you should see the\n\n```text\nGROMACS/2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU\n```\n\nmodule in the list. Note the relation between the name of the EasyBuild recipe\nand the module name and version of the module. This is only the case though if\nthe EasyBuild recipe follows the EasyBuild guidelines for naming. If the\nguidelines are not followed and if EasyBuild needs to install this module as a\ndependency of another package, EasyBuild will fail to locate the build recipe.\n\nThe `GROMACS/2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU` module can now be used just like\nany other module on the system. To *use* the GROMACS module, you don't need to load `EasyBuild-user`.\nThat was only required for *installing* the package. \nAll you need to do to use the GROMACS module we just installed is \n\n```bash\nmodule load LUMI/23.09\nmodule load GROMACS/2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU\n```\n\n(i.e., loading the software stack in which we installed GROMACS and the GROMACS module that \nwe installed).\n\n\n### A special case: Modules for singularity containers\n\nWe provide some EasyConfigs to build modules for singularity containers that we provide \nelsewhere on the system. These are marked in the [LUMI Software Library][software-library]\nwith a \"C\" on a purple background in the list and a \"singularity container\" label on the\npage for the specific package. \n\nThese EasyConfigs will copy the container to a safe place in your user installation so that\nyou can keep it if reproducibility is a concern for you. They will also install modules that\ndefine some standard variables that make it easy to locate the container and set the\nappropriate bindings for the `singularity` command. \nSome of the container modules also provide some wrapper scripts that make it easier to\nwork with the container or can serve as an example for your own scripts to use the\nsoftware in the container.\n\nIn many cases, the singularity container file in your own directory space can be removed\nand the module will automatically pick up the central one. However, check the documentation\nfor the package in the [LUMI Software Library][software-library], it will tell you if you can do so.\n\nDo keep in mind though that the centrally stored container file will be removed if we find problems\n with it, while the container may still be perfectly fine for you. E.g., some containers\nprovide the RCCL communication library which is popular in AI applications, but requires a \nspecific plugin to work well with the Slingshot 11 interconnect of LUMI. These containers often\nneed to be rebuilt after a system upgrade, but they may still be perfectly fine for users who use\nonly a single GPU or a single GPU node. If you want to keep using the older version though, it has \nto be installed in your own file space.\n\nThe containers we provide do in general not depend on any specific version of the Cray \nProgramming Environment and hence also not on a specific version of the LUMI software stack.\nHence, LUMI provides a mechanism to install the container modules in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
