The tool also reports the storage billing units.\n\nA description of how the jobs are billed is provided in the next sections.  \n\n## Compute billing\n\nCompute is billed whenever you submit a job to the [Slurm job scheduler][slurm-quickstart].\n\n### CPU billing\n\nFor CPU compute, your project is allocated CPU-core-hours that are consumed\nwhen running jobs on the CPU nodes. The CPU-core-hours are billed as:\n\n```text\ncpu-core-hours-billed = cpu-cores-allocated x runtime-of-job\n```\n\nFor example, allocating 32 CPU cores in a job running for 2 hours consumes:\n\n```text\n32 CPU-cores x 2 hours = 64 CPU-core-hours\n```\n\n### CPU Slurm partition billing details\n\nFor some [Slurm partitions][slurm-partitions] special billing rules apply.\n\n#### CPU Standard and bench Slurm partitions\n\nThe `standard` and `bench` Slurm partitions are operated in exclusive mode: the\nentire node will always be allocated. Thus, 128 CPU-core-hours are billed for\nevery allocated node and per hour even if your job has requested less than 128\ncores per node.\n\nFor example, allocating 16 nodes in a job running for 12 hours consumes:\n\n```text\n16 nodes x 128 CPU-cores/node x 12 hours = 24576 CPU-core-hours\n```\n\n#### CPU Small Slurm partition\n\nWhen using the `small` Slurm partition you are billed per allocated core.\nHowever, if you are above a certain threshold of memory allocated per core,\ni.e. you use the high memory nodes in [LUMI-C][lumi-c], you are billed per\nslice of 2GB memory (which is still billed in units of CPU-core-hours).\nSpecifically, the formula used for billing is:\n\n```text\nCPU-core-hours-billed = max(\n  CPU-cores-allocated, ceil(memory-allocated / 2GB)\n  ) x runtime-of-job\n```\n\nThus,\n\n- if you use 2GB or less of memory per core, you are charged per allocated\n  cores.\n- if you use more than 2GB of memory per core, you are charged per 2GB slice\n  of memory.\n\nFor example, allocating 4 CPU-cores and 4GB of memory in a job running for 1 day\nconsumes:\n\n```text\n4 CPU-cores x 24 hours = 96 CPU-core-hours\n```\n\nAllocating 4 CPU-cores and 32GB of memory in a job running for 1 day consumes:\n\n```text\n(32GB / 2GB) CPU-cores x 24 hours = 384 CPU-core-hours\n```\n\n### GPU billing\n\nFor GPU compute, your project is allocated GPU-core-hours that are consumed\nwhen running jobs on the GPU nodes. A GPU-hour corresponds to the allocation\nof a full MI250x module (2 GCDs) for one hour.\n\nFor the `standard-g` partitions, where full nodes are\nallocated, the 4 GPUs modules are billed\n\n```text\nGPU-hours-billed = 4 * runtime-of-job\n```\n\ni.e., one node hours correspond to 4 GPU-hours. If you allocate 4 nodes in the\n`standard-g` partition and that your job runs for 24 hours,\nyou will consume\n\n```text\n4 * 4 * 24 = 384 GPU-hours\n```\n\nFor the `small-g` and `dev-g` Slurm partitions, where allocation can be done at \nthe level of Graphics Compute Dies (GCD), you will be billed at a 0.5 rate per\nGCD allocated. However, if you allocate more than 8 CPU cores or more than 64 GB\nof memory per GCD, you will be billed per slice of 8 cores or 64 GB of memory.\n\nThe billing formula is:\n\n```text\nGPU-hours-billed = (\n    max(\n        ceil(CPU-cores-allocated / 8),\n        ceil(memory-allocated / 64GB),\n        GCDs-allocated )\n    * runtime-of-job) * 0.5\n```\n\nFor example, for a job allocating 2 GCDs and running for 24 hours, you will \nconsume\n\n```text\n(2 * 24 ) * 0.5 = 24 GPU-hours\n```\n\nIf you allocate 1 GCD for 24 hours but allocate 128 GB of memory, then you will\nbe billed for this memory:\n\n```\nceil(128 / 64) * 24 * 0.5 = 24 GPU-hours\n```\n\n## Storage billing\n\nFor storage, your project is allocated TB-hours.
