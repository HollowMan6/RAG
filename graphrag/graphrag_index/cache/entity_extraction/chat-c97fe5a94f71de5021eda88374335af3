It is part of the\n[Fairdata.fi]( https://www.fairdata.fi/) research data management environment\nand not directly linked to the CSC computing environment. Use of the IDA\nservice requires that the stored data is described as a research dataset with\nFairdata Qvain tool for others to discover. Even though CSC produces and hosts\nthe IDA service and the IDA storage space is applied to a CSC project, the\nstorage space is granted by the home organization of the user (Finnish higher\neducation institution or state research institute). IDA users can use the\nstorage space from both their own computers and from the servers hosted by CSC.\nMore information about applying for IDA storage space can be found at the\n[IDA website](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/).\n\nIDA can be used with a web browser user interface, as well as with a\ncommand-line client tool `ida` that is available on the computing servers\nhosted by CSC (Puhti and Mahti). IDA client can also be downloaded from\n[GitHub](https://github.com/CSCfi/ida2-command-line-tools).\n\nThe storage of files in IDA can be managed using the web and command-line\nclient interfaces. However, the contents of the stored files can't be modified\ndirectly. Instead, a stored file must be first retrieved from IDA to either CSC\nsupercomputers or some other computer in order to analyze or modify the data.\nIn this sense IDA resembles very much the\n[Allas object storage service](../Allas/introduction.md). However, IDA and\nAllas are designed to serve different use cases:\n\n* Allas is low-level and high-capacity storage service for utilizing research\n  data at CSC and other computing environments.\n* IDA is designed for storing and sharing well-defined and stable datasets that\n  are not used or modified on a daily basis.\n\nIn a typical research project the raw data is first stored in Allas. When the\nresearch work has produced a more refined dataset from the original data, it\ncan be stored in IDA so that metadata and persistent identifiers can be\nassociated with the data via additional services.\n\nEach IDA project has two storage areas: _staging area_ and _frozen area_. The\nstaging area is intended for collecting and organizing data in preparation for\nlonger term storage and publication. Data files that will not change anymore\ncan be moved to the frozen area to be stored in an _immutable_ state.\n\nFiles in the frozen area are visible to other Fairdata services and can be\nincluded in datasets using the\n[Qvain metadata tool](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/qvain/). Files in the staging\narea are not visible to other services and cannot be included in datasets.\n\n## Configuring and using IDA in CSC supercomputers\n\nThe IDA client and configuration tools are activated with the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load ida\n```\n\nWhen you start using the IDA client in CSC supercomputers for the first time,\nyou must set up your IDA connection by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nida_configure\n```\n\nThe configuration process asks for your CSC project number, username and\n[application password](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/user-guide/#app-passwords).\nThis information can be obtained from the\n[security settings page of the IDA web interface](https://ida.fairdata.fi/settings/user/security).\nThe configuration is stored in your home directory, so you need to do it only\nonce.\n\nOnce you have configured the connection, you can start using the `ida`\ncommand-line client that enables data transport between the supercomputer and\nIDA. Data can be uploaded and downloaded from the IDA staging area. From the\nfrozen area only download is possible. Note that some key features of IDA, like\nmoving data from staging area to the frozen area, is possible only through the\n[IDA web interface](https://ida.fairdata.fi).\n\nThe basic syntax of the `ida` commands is:\n\n```bash\nida <task> [options] <target_in_ida> <target_in_puhti>\n```\n\nTo check the contents of your staging area in IDA, use the command:\n\n```bash\nida info /\n```\n\nAdding option `-f` to the `ida` command makes the command reference the frozen\narea instead of the staging area. For example, the following command would give\nyou information about the file `test2` in the root of the frozen area:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 ~] ida info -f /test2\nproject:    2000136\npathname:   /test2\narea:       frozen\ntype:       file\npid:        5bc456a74ba89743214993f23695474\nsize:       113926178937\nencoding:   application/octet-stream\nmodified:   2018-10-15T08:17:53Z\nfrozen:     2018-10-15T08:58:15Z\n```\n\nUploading and downloading files and directories between Puhti and IDA is done\nwith the commands:\n\n```bash\nida upload <target_in_ida> <local_file>\nida download <target_in_ida> <local_file> \n```\n\nFor example in Puhti, the command:\n\n```bash\nida upload /test123/data1 test_data\n```\n\nwill upload file `test_data` from Puhti to the IDA staging area and store the\ndata in the directory `test123` with the name `data1`.
