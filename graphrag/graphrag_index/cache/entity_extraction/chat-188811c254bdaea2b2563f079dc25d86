These services are not strictly part of cPouta, but they provide extra\nfunctionality to make the service more useful.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Sending e-mail from cPouta\n\nSometimes you need to be able to send e-mail from a cPouta virtual\nmachine. This might be notifications when something happens or\nregistration confirmation e-mails.\n\nWe're now providing a service to do this. It is provided as-is. The service is still in the\nevaluation stages, and we might make changes to the service based on\nour experience and any feedback we get.\n\nTo use this service, you need to configure your mail transfer agent\n(MTA) to use the following SMTP relay server (a.k.a. smarthost):\n\n```\nsmtp.pouta.csc.fi:25\n```\n\nThe server does not require authentication.\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\n\nsender = 'sender@domain.com'\nreceivers = ['destination@domain.com']\n\nmessage = \"\"\"From: SENDER NAME <%s>\nTo: DESTINATION NAME <%s>\nSubject: SMTP e-mail test\n\nThis is a test e-mail message.\n\"\"\" % (sender, receivers[0])\n\ntry:\n   smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.pouta.csc.fi')\n   smtpObj.sendmail(sender, receivers, message)\n   print(\"Successfully sent email\")\nexcept SMTPException:\n   print(\"Error: unable to send email\")\n```\n\nWhen sending e-mail, you need a valid _Sender_ address in your e-mails,\nsuch as your university e-mail address, since this will be validated by\nthe SMTP server.\n\nIf you want to set up any services on cPouta that generate a large\namount of SMTP traffic (e.g. public mailing lists), please contact\nthe CSC Service Desk to coordinate this.\n\n### About Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and others\n\nYou might need to add CSC's SPF record to your own domain existing DNS record, if SPF is already configured in use. \nEven if SPF is not configured, it should be anyway considered because some email domains reject emails from email domains where SPF is not configured.\n\n!!! info \"Authenticated SMTP server\"\n    In some situation, instead of configuring the SPF record, it is better to simply use an external authenticated SMTP server. Preferably the SMTP server provided by your email provider.\n\n    Also it's good to understand that you may only add/edit SPF record of a domain for which your organization manages its DNS records.\n\n!!! warning \"Silent email discards\"\n    A badly configured SPF record might have the effect that emails are silently discarded by some email providers. \n\n    Please note that taking SPF in use, or just by modifying existing record incorrectly, affects the whole domain email traffic functionality.\n\nThe part which should be added to SPF record is \"include:hosted-at.csc.fi\".\nYour domain SPF record should look then something like this:\n\n```\ndomain.of.the.sending.email.address.    IN    TXT    \"v=spf1 include:hosted-at.csc.fi ~all\"\n```\n\nYou can use the `dig` command to check if the entry already exists in your domain existing DNS record:\n```\ndig domain.of.the.sending.email.address TXT\n\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\ndomain.of.the.sending.email.address.    IN    TXT    \"v=spf1 include:hosted-at.csc.fi ~all\"\n```\n\nThere are other protocols to take into account, like Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) and DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail), but the details are out of scope for this document.\n\nHere is a simplified summary of the different DNS records for a domain sending emails:  \n  - SPF tells from where you can send emails using a \"SMTP Sender\" in that domain  \n  - DKIM signature records specify public keys that are used to sign the email messages with a \"From\" in that domain  \n  - DMARC specifies how messages that fail any of the above should be handled  \n\nIf you are using `smtp.pouta.csc.fi`, the SPF record specifies that emails with an \"SMTP sender\" in csc.fi can be sent. The messages with a \"From\" in csc.fi are signed with our key and the DMARC record for csc.fi specifies that the messages that fail any of the above should be quarantined.\n\nIf you want the services such as Google, Microsoft, etc to check and identify your emails, you can register a new domain for this purpose, host email services with appropriate forwarding, create SPF/DKIM/DMARC records for it and use this domain in the email headers.\n\n## DNS services in cPouta\n\ncPouta does not currently offer integrated name service management.\n\n### Predefined DNS names\n\nAll our floating IPs are by default mapped to a hostname, for example:\n\n```\nvm0120.kaj.pouta.csc.fi has address 86.50.168.120\n```\n\nThese default DNS records do also have the reverse DNS entry. To find the hostname of a floating IP, you can use `host` command:\n\n```sh\nhost -a <floating IP address>\n```\n\nAnd the result is `vmXXXX.kaj.pouta.csc.fi` listed in the output:\n\n```\n...\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nx.x.x.x.in-addr.arpa. xxx IN     PTR     vmXXXX.kaj.pouta.csc.fi.\n```\n\n### Custom DNS name\n\nIn some cases you would like to use your own DNS name, a different one to the predefined one explained above, for example `mywesite.myuniversity\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
