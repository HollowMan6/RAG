Just go get a coffee, or beverage of\n    your choice, and try again in a\n    few minutes! &nbsp;  ☕\n\nAfter logging in, you will see the Puhti web interface, which looks something\nlike this:\n\n![Puhti web interface front page](../../img/ood_main.png)\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Puhti's web interface (based on [Open\nOnDemand][OOD]), take some time to familiarize yourself with its functions.\n\nFor now, the main things to check are:\n\n- The *Files* menu, it should show several disk areas for your use: your\n  personal *Home directory* and `projappl` and `scratch` directories for each of\n  your projects.\n\n- The *Tools* → *Login node shell* to start a terminal session on Puhti. From\n  here you can run Linux commands.\n\n## Step 4: Copy your code to Puhti\n\n**It is recommended to keep your code in the `projappl` directory of the project\nto which your code belongs**, for example `/projappl/project_2001234/`. You can\nnavigate to this location in the Files browser in the Puhti web interface.\n\nIf you have code on your own computer, one option is to use the \"Upload\" button,\nin the upper right corner in the Files browser. \n\nIn our case we will clone the [code from a GitHub repository][GHExample], and\nfor that we need to open a terminal session. Click \"Open in Terminal\" in the\nFiles browser or start the *Login node shell* from the *Tools* menu. Then type\nthe following commands (and press ENTER at the end of each line):\n\n```bash\ncd /projappl/project_2001234  # needed only if your didn't navigate to correct directory\ngit clone https://github.com/mvsjober/pytorch-cifar10-example\n```\n\nThis should create a copy of the code from the given GitHub repository to the\nPuhti drive. You can now enter the newly created directory, either from the\nterminal, or via the Files browser.\n\n!!! note\n\n    Here we have provided some example code for training a simple neural network on\n    CIFAR10 data. You can of course replace that with your own code, for example\n    from your own computer.\n\nIn the Files browser you can view a file by simply clicking on it. In particular\ncheck the main source code in `cifar10_cnn.py`. Towards the end of the file you\ncan see the command line options. Notice that `--data_path` is a required\noption, it is the path to where the dataset is stored.\n\nIn the Files browser you can edit a file by clicking on the file-specific menu\n(three dots) and selecting *Edit*, as shown below.\n\n![How to edit a file in Puhti web](../../img/ood-edit-example.png)\n\n\n## Step 5: Copy your data to Puhti\n\n**It is recommended to keep your training data in the `scratch` directory of the\nproject**, for example `/scratch/project_2001234/`. **Remember that the scratch\nwill be regularly cleaned, so don't keep anything important there.** Datasets\nshould typically have another more permanent location, such as in\n[Allas](../../data/Allas/index.md) for storing during the project's life-time.\n\nYou can navigate to `/scratch/project_2001234/` in the *Files* browser in the\nPuhti web interface. Here we will fetch the dataset from a public Allas bucket\nwith `wget`. The `wget` command can be used to download any files which has a\nURL address.\n\nType the command to download the dataset (launching the terminal as in Step 4 if\nyou haven't already done that):\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2001234  # needed only if your didn't navigate to correct directory\nwget https://a3s.fi/mldata/cifar-10-python.tar.gz\n```\n\nThe downloaded file is a compressed archive of the CIFAR10 dataset in a\nPython-friendly format. \n\nNext you could extract the archive, but in this example we have opted not to do\nso. We will instead extract the files to the fast local drive at the start of\neach job. More on this in the next section.\n\n## Step 6: Check what Python libraries you need\n\nBefore running your code, you should check what Python frameworks or libraries\nyou need. If you are using code that you have downloaded from the Internet,\nthere will usually be some installation instructions or a `requirements.txt`\nfile which tells what Python libraries are needed. Keep in mind, that **often\nyou should not follow the installation instructions exactly as they often assume\nthat you are installing on a personal computer**.\n\n**CSC provides many pre-installed Python environments for popular frameworks and\nlibraries**. It's usually a good idea to use these as a starting point, even if\nthey don't contain all the packages you need. Check the list of\n[data analytics and machine learning modules provided on CSC's supercomputers](../../apps/by_discipline.md#data-analytics-and-machine-learning).\n\nFor example [PyTorch](../../apps/pytorch.md) and\n[TensorFlow](../../apps/tensorflow.md) have their own dedicated modules, while\n[Python Data](../../apps/python-data.md) is a general module containing many\ndata analytics libraries such as numpy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Dask, JupyterLab\nand many others. These software environments can be activated with the `module\nload` command. See the specific documentation pages listed above for more\ndetails.\n\nIf you find a module that has most of what you need, but a few packages are\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer providing a web interface for various computing tasks, including file management and terminal access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPEN ONDEMAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Open OnDemand (OOD) is the platform on which Puhti's web interface is based, offering tools for job management and file navigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code repositories, used here to clone code to Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIFAR10<|>EVENT<|>CIFAR10 is a dataset used for training a simple neural network in the provided example code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a data storage service mentioned as a more permanent location for datasets during a project's lifetime)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>OPEN ONDEMAND<|>Puhti's web interface is based on Open OnDemand, indicating a direct usage and integration relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>GITHUB<|>Code from a GitHub repository is cloned to Puhti, showing a relationship of data transfer and code management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CIFAR10<|>CIFAR10 dataset is used in an example on Puhti for neural network training, indicating a use case relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Datasets stored in Allas are mentioned in the context of being used with Puhti, showing a data management and storage relationship<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
