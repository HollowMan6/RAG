This is an excellent option for use cases where the\naim is to run a large amount of independent computations, such as when\ngenerating data for AI/ML pipelines. All subjobs are run in parallel within a\nsingle Slurm allocation, thus avoiding excess calls of `srun` or `sbatch` which\ndecreases the load on the batch queue system.\n\nRunning `FARMING` jobs requires an additional input file in which the details\nof the workflow, such as the input directories and number of parallel task\ngroups, are specified. Example input and batch script files are provided below.\nNote that `RUN_TYPE` is set to `NONE` in the `&GLOBAL` section.\n\n=== \"Input file\"\n\n    ```text title=\"farming.inp\"\n    &GLOBAL\n      PROJECT my-farming-job\n      PROGRAM FARMING\n      RUN_TYPE NONE\n    &END GLOBAL\n    &FARMING\n      NGROUPS 8\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run1\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run2\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run3\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run4\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run5\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run6\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run7\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n      &JOB\n        DIRECTORY run8\n        INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp\n      &END JOB\n    &END FARMING\n    ```\n\n=== \"Batch script file\"\n\n    ```bash title=\"farming.sh\"\n    #!/bin/bash -l\n    #SBATCH --time=00:30:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=medium\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n\n    module purge\n    module load gcc/9.4.0 openmpi/4.1.2\n    module load cp2k/2024.2\n\n    srun cp2k.psmp farming.inp >> farming.out\n    ```\n\nIn this particular example, one full Mahti node is requested for running 8\nsingle-point calculations of a NaCl crystal with different lattice constants.\nIn addition to the `farming.inp` input, each subjob requires its own ordinary\ninput file, which are here organized into separate subdirectories named `run*`.\nIssuing `sbatch farming.sh` in the parent directory launches all calculations\nin parallel, allocating 16 cores to each subjob.\n\nNote that dependencies can also be specified between subjobs using the\n`DEPENDENCIES` and `JOB_ID` keywords under the `&JOB` section. This enables the\ndefinition of complex workflows.
