Repeated abuse of these\n    partitions might result in account suspension.\n\n    #### Small partitions\n    LUMI is optimized for large jobs (dozens of nodes). However not all \n    applications can scale efficiently at large-scale or even at the node level. \n    Allocating an entire node for a serial pre/post-processing job or for an \n    application that can only use a single GPU is not an efficient use of the\n    resources.\n        \n    The kind of jobs described above should use the small partitions. On these\n    partitions you can only allocate a few nodes but you can run for a longer\n    period of time.\n\n    #### Large memory nodes\n    The [LUMI-C][lumi-c] large memory nodes (512GB and 1TB) are located in the\n    `small` partition. Therefore, to use these nodes, you need to\n    select the `small` partition (`--partition=small`). Then the LUMI-C large\n    memory nodes will be allocated if you request more memory than is available\n    in the LUMI-C standard compute nodes.\n \n    The nodes in the `largemem` partition are part of [LUMI-D][lumi-d] and have\n    4TB of memory per node. They are mostly meant for data-intensive pre- and \n    postprocessing and should not be the only compute resource used by your\n    project as there are only a limited number of those nodes.\n\n    #### Visualization nodes\n    [LUMI-D](lumi-d) nodes are the only nodes in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a high-performance computing (HPC) facility that offers various computing partitions for different types of jobs, including large-scale computations and debugging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used at LUMI to manage jobs and resources on the computing nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD-G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in LUMI for jobs that use all resources on a node, specifically designed for GPU-intensive tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in LUMI for jobs that require all resources on a node, mainly for CPU-intensive tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A special partition in LUMI reserved for large-scale benchmark runs, requiring full machine access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEV-G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in LUMI for debugging GPU jobs, allowing for sub-node allocations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEBUG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in LUMI for debugging and testing jobs, allowing for sub-node allocations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL-G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in LUMI for small GPU jobs, optimized for jobs that do not scale to use many nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in LUMI for small or memory-intensive jobs, allowing for longer run times on a few nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGEMEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in LUMI for memory-intensive jobs, featuring nodes with up to 4TB of memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-D<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hardware partition within LUMI, designated for visualization and data-intensive pre- and postprocessing tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-C<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hardware partition within LUMI, designated for standard compute and large memory nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hardware partition within LUMI, designated for GPU-intensive tasks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD-G<|>LUMI-G<|>The STANDARD-G partition uses the LUMI-G hardware partition for GPU-intensive tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD<|>LUMI-C<|>The STANDARD partition uses the LUMI-C hardware partition for CPU-intensive tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENCH<|>LUMI-C<|>The BENCH partition uses the LUMI-C hardware for large-scale benchmark runs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENCH<|>LUMI-G<|>The BENCH partition also uses the LUMI-G hardware for large-scale benchmark runs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEV-G<|>LUMI-G<|>The DEV-G partition is specifically for debugging GPU jobs on the LUMI-G hardware<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEBUG<|>LUMI-C<|>The DEBUG partition is for debugging and testing jobs on the LUMI-C hardware<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMALL-G<|>LUMI-G<|>The SMALL-G partition is for small GPU jobs on the LUMI-G hardware<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMALL<|>LUMI-C<|>The SMALL partition is for small or memory-intensive jobs on the LUMI-C hardware<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGEMEM<|>LUMI-D<|>The LARGEMEM partition, with nodes having up to 4TB of memory, is part of the LUMI-D hardware<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-D<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-D is a hardware partition within the LUMI HPC facility, designated for specific tasks like visualization<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-C<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-C is a hardware partition within the LUMI HPC facility, designated for standard compute and large memory nodes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-G<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-G is a hardware partition within the LUMI HPC facility, designated for GPU-intensive tasks<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
