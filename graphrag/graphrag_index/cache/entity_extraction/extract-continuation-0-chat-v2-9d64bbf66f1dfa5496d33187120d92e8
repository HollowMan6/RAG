The node count of [Mahti](systems-mahti.md) is similar, 1404 AMD CPU nodes (2x64 cores each). Although the systems are very alike based on CPU-hardware, core count and performance, there are important differences which are highlighted on this page.\n\n## GPUs and memory\n\nMahti has only a few (24) GPU-nodes available, while LUMI-C is flanked by [LUMI-G](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumig/) and [LUMI-D](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumid/) with a massive GPU capacity. Also, Mahti has 256 GB memory in all CPU nodes, while LUMI-C has also 512 GB and 1024 GB memory nodes (similar to Puhti).\n\n## Accessing and SSH keys\n\nTo access LUMI, you need to first [create a LUMI-specific project](../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md#how-to-create-finnish-lumi-projects). Note that LUMI-projects have a finite duration ([see below](lumi-vs-mahti.md#finite-time-projects)) and cannot be used for running on the national resources and vice versa.\n\nFurthermore, accessing LUMI is only possible using SSH keys, meaning that you cannot use passwords to connect through SSH like on Mahti. For instructions on how to generate an SSH key pair and uploading the public key to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/), see [Setting up SSH keys](connecting/ssh-keys.md) and the [Get started with LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/getstarted/) pages.\n\nSimilar to Puhti and Mahti, LUMI can, however, also be accessed through a [web interface](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/).\n\n## Finite time projects\n\nFinnish LUMI projects have a finite duration ranging from 3 months to max. 3 years depending on the access mode:\n\n|Access mode  |Length  |Can be extended?               |\n|-------------|--------|-------------------------------|\n|Regular      |1 year  |No                             |\n|Benchmark    |3 months|No                             |\n|Extreme scale|1 year  |No                             |\n|Development  |1 year  |Yes, twice = max. 3 years total|\n\nFor more details on the access modes, see the [LUMI access page on the Services for Research website](https://research.csc.fi/lumi-access). Note that LUMI users from Finland are also eligible to apply for EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (JU) resources. [See more details on European access modes here](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/get-started-2021/users-in-europe/).\n\n## Software installation policy\n\nSimilar to Mahti, CSC offers some frequently used applications as pre-installed modules on LUMI. A list of these can be found in [CSC Docs](../apps/by_system.md#lumi) as well as [LUMI Docs](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/local/csc/).\n\nTo facilitate installing own software on LUMI, the [EasyBuild tool](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/easybuild/) is provided along with [installation recipes](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/LUMI-EasyBuild-contrib) (EasyConfig files) using which you can install additional applications to your home or project directories. Additionally, a [container wrapper](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/container-wrapper/) identical to the [Tykky tool](containers/tykky.md) is provided as a means to wrap installations inside an Apptainer/Singularity container. This is recommended especially for Conda and pip environments to alleviate the load on the parallel filesystem.\n\nIf you have problems installing your software on LUMI, please [send a ticket to the LUMI user support team](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/)!\n\n## Programming environment and software stacks\n\nThe programming environment of LUMI is quite different compared to CSC supercomputers. LUMI comes with three alternative programming environments, namely Cray, GNU and AOCC. Each of the environments have their own compiler suites that become available upon loading the corresponding programming environment module. Moreover, two types of software stacks are offered, the CrayEnv and LUMI stacks. Please refer to the LUMI documentation for a detailed description of the [available collection of compiler suites](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/compiling/prgenv/) and [software stacks](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/lumi_env/softwarestacks/) and how to swap between these.\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Irrespective of the loaded compiler suite, one noticeable difference concerning the LUMI programming environment is that it comes with compiler wrappers that replace commands commonly found on HPC systems such as Mahti. For example, commands for compiling MPI code like `mpicc`, `mpic++` and `mpif90` are unavailable as such. Instead, you should use the wrappers `cc`, `CC` and `ftn`, respectively. See the LUMI documentation for [more details on the available MPI wrappers](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/compiling/prgenv/#compile-an-mpi-program).\n\n## Disk areas and storage\n\nSimilar to CSC super\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-C<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI-C is a supercomputer with 2048 AMD CPU nodes, each with 2x64 cores, and offers a variety of memory nodes including 512 GB and 1024 GB, alongside massive GPU capacity through LUMI-G and LUMI-D\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a supercomputer with 1404 AMD CPU nodes, each with 2x64 cores, and has 256 GB memory in all CPU nodes along with a few GPU-nodes\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Part of the LUMI supercomputer ecosystem, providing massive GPU capacity\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-D<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Part of the LUMI supercomputer ecosystem, providing massive GPU capacity\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer that, similar to Mahti, has been mentioned in the context of memory node comparisons with LUMI-C\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is the organization offering access to supercomputers like LUMI, Mahti, and Puhti, and provides various services including software installation and user support\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROHPC JOINT UNDERTAKING (JU)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An entity that LUMI users from Finland are eligible to apply for resources from\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASYBUILD TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool provided for LUMI users to facilitate the installation of their own software\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A container wrapper provided for LUMI, similar to the one used for software installations on other CSC supercomputers\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-C<|>LUMI-G<|>LUMI-C is flanked by LUMI-G, enhancing its GPU capacity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-C<|>LUMI-D<|>LUMI-C is flanked by LUMI-D, enhancing its GPU capacity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-C<|>CSC<|>LUMI-C is one of the supercomputers offered by CSC for computational research<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC<|>Mahti is one of the supercomputers offered by CSC for computational research<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is another supercomputer mentioned in the context of CSC's computational resources<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EASYBUILD TOOL<|>LUMI-C<|>The EasyBuild tool is provided for installing software on LUMI-C<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY TOOL<|>LUMI-C<|>The Tykky tool is provided as a container wrapper for software installations on LUMI-C<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
