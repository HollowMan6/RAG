See the [terms of use](https://rahti.csc.fi/terms_of_use.html) for details about the\nresponsibilities.\n\nThis guide should be treated as the baseline which must be taken\nin account rather than a checklist for perfect security.\n\nMeasures that tighten the security of the services running in Rahti 1 can be\nroughly divided in two categories.\n\n## Securing routes\n\nEnable the **TLS encryption** of routes. If the DNS name of your service is under\nthe subdomain `rahtiapp.fi` (e.g. `coolservice.rahtiapp.fi`), the default\nwildcard TLS certificate provided by Rahti 1 can be used directly. Otherwise,\nyou need to add your certificate data in the route object.\n\nAccess to the services should be limited to selected networks with\n**whitelists** whenever applicable (See the chapter\n[Routes](../tutorials/elemental_tutorial.md#route)). This is relevant whenever \naccess can be restricted in terms of IP addresses.\n\nSecure routes thwart eavesdropping attacks that target e.g. service passwords\nand usernames, and other critical data sent over the internet.\n\n## Image security\n\nOutdated container images are prone to exploits via security vulnerabilities,\nand unfamiliar images may contain malicious code. For these reasons, a given container\nimage should be used only if:\n\n1. It is from a known and trusted source so that the known security\n   vulnerabilities are patched and you can trust it not to contain malicious\n   code.\n2. You have reviewed its Dockerfile build configuration and the base layer\n   satisfies Rule #1 or #2.\n\nOther things to keep in mind:\n\n* Use curated images.\n* Prefer images that regularly receive security updates.\n* Use static container image analysis tools if available. For support, ask your\n  local IT support.\n* The smaller the image, the less \"surface area\" there is for attacks:\n  * Utilize the builder pattern in your images if you use compiled languages:\n    Build the binary in a different image from where the application is\n    deployed. In Docker, this can be achieved with [multi-stage\n    builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/),\n    and in OpenShift, directories of other images may be mounted during the build\n    process by [chaining\n    builds](https://docs.okd.io/3.11/dev_guide/builds/advanced_build_operations.html#dev-guide-chaining-builds).\n    This way, only essential pieces of the software are present in the\n    final image.\n  * If the application is written in an interpreted language, use language\n    based images. Instead of installing Node.js on top of the Debian image, use\n    e.g., `node:8-debian`.\n\n## IP addresses for firewall openings\n\nThe IP for all outgoing customer traffic is `193.167.189.25`. By opening a firewall to this IP, you will let in all traffic coming from any Rahti 1 project. It is advised to not solely rely in IP filtering for security, but use this a secondary measure, like for example an OAuth authentication system.\n\nThere is no plan to change this IP, but it is not possible to give a 100% assurance that an unforeseeable event will ever force us to change it. If this IP ever changes, it will be properly announced in advance.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
