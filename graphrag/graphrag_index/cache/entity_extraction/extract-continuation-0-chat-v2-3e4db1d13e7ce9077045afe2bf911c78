This could be useful to remove\nan external dependency or improve performance.\n\nThe process is simple:\n\n1. [Install](../../usage/cli/#how-to-install-the-oc-tool) and [login with OC](../../usage/cli/#how-to-login-with-oc).\n\n1. With a terminal, connect to the Rahti 2 registry:\n    ```sh\n    docker login -p $(oc whoami -t ) -u unused image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi\n    ```\n\n    !!! info\n        If you get any error, make sure you are logged in. If you run `oc whoami`, the command should return your username.\n\n2. Tag the image you want to push:\n   ```sh\n   docker tag centos:7 image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi/{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}/centos:<tag>\n   ```\n   _Replace {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME} by the name of your project._\n\n3. Push your image:\n   ```sh\n   docker push image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi/{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}/centos:<tag>\n   ```\n\nYou should be able to see your images in your project:\n![Image Streams](../../img/image_streams_rahti4.png)\n\n## Using Manually Cached Images \n\nGo to your project's deployment, and edit it.\n\n![Edit deployment](../../img/edit_deployment.png)\n\nGo to the Images section, make sure the option \"Deploy images from an image stream tag\" is clicked.\nFinally select the new image.\n\n![Use cached image](../../img/use_cached_image.png)\n\n## Access Control for the Rahti 2 Integrated Registry\n\nRahti 2 allows fine-grained control over access to the integrated image registry, enabling management of access based on [user authentication](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/authentication/understanding-authentication.html).\n\n### 1. **Anonymous Access** (`system:anonymous`)\n\nThis refers to users who access the registry without providing any authentication credentials. In this scenario, they have no identity attached to their requests.\n\n- **How to enable**: Use the following command to allow anonymous users to pull images from your project's registry:\n  ```bash\n  oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer system:anonymous -n <project>\n  ```\n- **Use case**: Suitable for cases where you want to make images publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view or pull images without logging in.\n\n### 2. **Unauthenticated Access** (`system:unauthenticated`)\n\nThis group includes all users who are accessing the system without valid authentication credentials, including anonymous users but potentially also used automated systems, scripts or external services  that do not need to be authenticate.\n\n- **How to enable**: Grant unauthenticated users access with the command:\n  ```bash\n  oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer system:unauthenticated -n <project>\n  ```\n- **Use case**: This is broader than `system:anonymous` and is useful for systems or services to access your registry without authentication.\n\n### 3. **Authenticated Access** (`system:authenticated`)\n\nAuthenticated users are those who have successfully logged in using valid credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens).\n\n- **How to enable**: To allow all authenticated users to access the registry:\n  ```bash\n  oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer system:authenticated -n <project>\n  ```\n- **Use case**: This allows any user with valid credentials to view or pull images, useful for restricting access.\n\n## Guide on Pulling Images from Rahti 1 Registry\n\nTo securely pull images from Rahti 1 registry to Rahti 2, follow this [guide](../../../support/faq/pull-from-rahtiv1-registry.md). It also explains how to convert images using `Skopeo` for compatibility with future releases.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 2 is an integrated registry that allows manual caching of images to improve performance or remove external dependencies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OC refers to the OpenShift command-line tool used for interacting with the Rahti 2 registry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free, enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>OC<|>OC is used to login and interact with the Rahti 2 registry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>DOCKER<|>Docker is used to tag and push images to the Rahti 2 registry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER<|>CENTOS<|>Docker can be used to tag and push CentOS images to the Rahti 2 registry<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
