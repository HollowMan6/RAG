Module system\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 2\npermalink: /hands-on/modules/module-exercise-with-aligners.html\n---\n\n# Biosoftware in Puhti\n\n> In this tutorial you will learn:\n- About the `biokit` module\n- How to search for applications\n- How to install Bioconda packages\n\nüí¨ Let's imagine that we have some sequencing data that we wish to align to a reference genome and check the quality of the alignment.\n\n## Looking for applications and related modules\n\n1. See the [list of applications in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/) and look for suitable aligners.\n   - Can you find for example TopHat, STAR, Bowtie and BWA aligners in the list?\n   - Which modules are needed to run these applications?  \n\nüí° The *biokit module* loads a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools.\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Let's check if the HISAT2 aligner is also available:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider hisat2\n```\n\n‚òùüèª All software installed on CSC's supercomputers don't necessarily have their own documentation page in the application list (yet). They might be new installations or installed by request of a single research group etc.\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Load the `biokit` module and see what is included:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\nmodule list\n```\n\n- Was HISAT2 also available in the `biokit` module?\n\n## RSeQC\n\nüí¨ Let's imagine you just did a successful aligning of the sequence data.\n\n- After aligning, you might want to check the quality of the alignment with the RSeQC tool.\n\nüí¨ As you can see from the `module list` command above, the RSeQC tool is not included in the `biokit` module.\n\n1. Try searching for the RSeQC tool by using the `module spider` command:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider rseqc\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Load the module and try to run one of the RSeQC commands (open the help for [`bam_stat.py`](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/#bam-stat-py)):\n\n```bash\nbam_stat.py -h\n```\n\n## Extra: Installing packages from Bioconda\n\nBioconda is a popular Conda channel for bioinformatics software. It provides an easy method to install thousands of software packages related to biomedical research. Conda environments are, however, problematic on supercomputers with parallel file systems since they create too many files. The solution is to use containerized environments.\n\n‚òùüèª Installing software and containers will be discussed more in sections [8](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/part-2/installing/) and [9](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/part-2/containers/). Feel free to return to this tutorial later.\n\n1. Look for the MetaBAT2 application like we did above with RSeQC:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider metabat2\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Check whether MetaBAT2 is available in [Bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io) (type metabat2 in the search field):\n3. All packages in Bioconda have a ready-made Docker container image available. While those images could be pulled and used directly, CSC's [Tykky container wrapper](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/) provides an easy method to install them so that they are usable without any special container commands.\n4. On the [Bioconda page](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/metabat2/README.html) find the command to use Docker (don't run it). In this case:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull quay.io/biocontainers/metabat2:<tag>\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. From the command we need the Docker address:\n\n```bash\nquay.io/biocontainers/metabat2\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 5\"}\n6. And from the [tags page](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/metabat2?tab=tags) the desired version. In this case we choose the latest (secure) version:\n\n```bash\n2.15--h986a166_1\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 6\"}\n7. Combine the address and tag to form the Docker URL:\n\n```bash\ndocker://quay.io/biocontainers/metabat2:2.15--h986a166_1\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 7\"}\n8. Clean your environment and load the Tykky container wrapper\n\n```bash\nmodule purge\nmodule load tykky\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 8\"}\n9. Create a directory for the installation under your project's `/projappl` directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /projappl/<project>/$USER/metabat-2.15    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 9\"}\n10. Wrap the container with:\n\n```bash\nwrap-container -w /usr/local/bin docker://quay.io/biocontainers/metabat2:2.15--h986a166_1 --prefix /projappl/<project>/$USER/metabat-2.15    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIOSOFTWARE IN PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tutorial on using bioinformatics software in Puhti supercomputing environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOKIT MODULE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in Puhti that loads a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISAT2 ALIGNER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software tool available in the biokit module for aligning sequencing data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSEQC TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for checking the quality of sequence data alignments, not included in the biokit module)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOCONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Conda channel for bioinformatics software, offering an easy method to install software packages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METABAT2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An application available in Bioconda for constructing metagenome assembled genomes from metagenomic data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool provided by CSC for installing containerized environments easily on supercomputers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOKIT MODULE<|>HISAT2 ALIGNER<|>The HISAT2 aligner is available as part of the biokit module<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOCONDA<|>METABAT2<|>MetaBAT2 is an application that can be installed from Bioconda<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>METABAT2<|>The Tykky container wrapper is used to install MetaBAT2 in a containerized environment on Puhti<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
