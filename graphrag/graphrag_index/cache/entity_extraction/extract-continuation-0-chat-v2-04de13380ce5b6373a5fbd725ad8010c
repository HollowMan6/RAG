(Note the `_` in tool names on Puhti!)\n\nFor `s2m_preprocess` and `s2m_mosaic` you can use the argument `--n_processes` to set the number of available CPU cores to the number of computing cores of your job.\n\n### Advanced usage\n\nFurther configuration of `s2m_preprocess` can be done via the `L2A_GIPP.xml` file (part of [Sen2cor](./sen2cor.md)). \nYou can find the default GIPP file in `/appl/soft/geo/sen2cor/2.9/Sen2Cor-02.09.00-Linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sen2cor/cfg/L2A_GIPP.xml`. \nCopy it to your `$HOME` directory, adjust it to your needs and add it to the call: `s2m_preprocess --gipp $HOME/L2A_GIPP.xml <other arguments>`\n\n## License\n\nSen2mosaic is published under the [GNU,GPL v3](https://github.com/smfm-project/sen2mosaic/blob/master/LICENSE.md) license.\n\n\n## Citation\n\nSen2mosaic does not provide any preferred citation information.\n\n```Samuel Bowers: Sen2mosaic v.0.2. https://github.com/smfm-project/sen2mosaic , last accessed on {date}.```\n\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nPlease acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072531) and the Open Geospatial Information Infrastructure for Research (Geoportti, urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072513) for computational resources and support\".\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAlmost all dependencies for Sen2mosaic are available from the [sen2cor](./sen2cor.md) and [geoconda](./geoconda.md) modules, so Sen2mosaic was installed on top of them using `pip install --user opencv-python git+https://github.com/smfm-project/sen2mosaic.git`, while both modules were loaded (remember to set the installation directory first with `export PYTHONUSERBASE=/path/to/sen2mosaic/install/directory`. For shorter command line calls, the commands `s2m_download` ,`s2m_preprocess` and `s2m_mosaic` were created to shorten the original `python3 /path/to/sen2mosaic/cli/download.py` commands.
