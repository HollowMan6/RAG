See [Jupyter application page](../webinterface/jupyter.md#tykky-installations) for details how to use your own Tykky installation with Puhti web interface Jupyter.\n\n### Pip with Conda\n\nTo install some additional pip packages, add the `-r <req_file>` argument, e.g.:\n\n```bash\nconda-containerize new -r req.txt --prefix <install_dir> env.yml\n```\n\n### Mamba\n\nThe tool also supports using [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) for installing\npackages. Mamba often finds suitable packages much faster than Conda, so it is a good\noption when the required package list is long. Enable this feature by adding the `--mamba`\nflag.\n\n```bash\nconda-containerize new --mamba --prefix <install_dir> env.yml\n```\n\n### End-to-end example\n\nCreate a new Conda-based installation using the previous `env.yml` file.\n\n```bash\nmkdir MyEnv\nconda-containerize new --prefix MyEnv env.yml\n```\n\nAfter the installation finishes, add the installation directory to your `PATH`\nand use it like normal.\n\n```bash\n$ export PATH=\"$PWD/MyEnv/bin:$PATH\"\n$ python --version\n3.8.8\n$ python3\nPython 3.8.8 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 20 2021, 16:22:27) \n[GCC 9.3.0] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import scipy\n>>> import nglview\n>>> \n```\n\n### Modifying a Conda installation\n\nTykky installations reside in a container, so they can not be directly modified.\nSmall Python packages can be added normally using `pip`, but then the Python packages\nwill be sitting on the parallel file system, which is not recommended for any larger\ninstallations.\n\nTo actually modify the installation, we can use the `update` keyword together with\nthe `--post-install <file>` option, which specifies a bash script with commands to\nrun to update the installation. The commands are executed with the Conda environment\nactivated.\n\n```bash\nconda-containerize update <existing installation> --post-install <file> \n```\n\nWhere `<file>` could e.g. contain:\n\n```bash\nconda install -y numpy\nconda remove -y nglview\npip install requests\n```\n\nIn this mode the whole host system is available including all software and modules.\n\n## Pip-based installations\n\nSometimes you don't need a full-blown Conda environment or you might prefer pip\nto manage Python installations. In this case we can use:\n\n```bash\npip-containerize new --prefix <install_dir> req.txt\n```\n\nwhere `req.txt` is a standard pip requirements file. The notes and options for\nmodifying a Conda installation apply here as well.\n\nNote that the Python version used by `pip-containerize` is the first Python executable\nfound in the path, so it's affected by loaded modules.\n\n**Important:** This Python can not be itself container-based as nesting is not possible!\n\nAn additional `--slim` flag exists, which will instead use a pre-built minimal Python\ncontainer with a much newer version of Python as a base. Without the `--slim` flag,\nthe whole host system is available, whereas with the flag the system installations (i.e.\n`/usr`, `/lib64`, ...) are no longer taken from the host, but instead coming from\nwithin the container.\n\n## Container-based installations\n\nTykky also provides an option to:\n\n- Generate wrappers for tools in existing Apptainer/Singularity containers so that\n  they can be used transparently (no need to prepend `apptainer exec ...` or modify\n  scripts if switching between containerized versions and \"normal\" installations).\n- Install tools available in Docker images, including generating wrappers.\n\n```bash\nwrap-container -w /path/inside/container <container> --prefix <install_dir> \n```\n\n- `<container>` can be a local filepath or any [URL accepted by\n  Apptainer/Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/cli/singularity_pull.html)\n  (e.g `docker://` `oras://`)\n- `-w` needs to be an absolute path (or comma-separated list) inside the container.\n  Wrappers will then be automatically created for the executables in the target\n  directories / for the target path. If you do not know the path of the executables\n  in the container, open a shell inside the container and use the [which\n  command](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-which-command/). To open a shell:\n  \t- In case of existing local Apptainer/Singularity file: `singularity shell image.sif`.\n  \t- In case of Docker or non-local Apptainer/Singularity file, create first the\n      installation with some path and then start with created `_debug_shell`.\n\n## Memory errors\n\nWith very large installations the resources available on the login node might\nnot be enough, resulting in Tykky failing with a `MemoryError`. In this case, the\ninstallation needs to be done on a compute node, for example using an [interactive\nsession](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md#sinteractive-in-puhti):\n\n```bash\n# Start interactive session, here with 12 GB memory and 15 GB local disk (increase if needed)\nsinteractive --account <project> --time 1:00:00\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A web interface used in Puhti and Mahti for computational tasks and data analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computational resource where Jupyter and other applications are used)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Another computational resource alongside Puhti for intensive computational tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package manager used to install additional pip packages and manage environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAMBA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A faster alternative to Conda for installing packages, especially useful for long package lists)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A system for containerized Python environments that cannot be directly modified but can be updated or added to)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package installer for Python, used for managing Python installations without a full Conda environment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER<|>PUHTI<|>Jupyter is used as a web interface for computational tasks in Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER<|>MAHTI<|>Jupyter is also utilized in Mahti for similar computational purposes as in Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDA<|>MAMBA<|>Mamba is an alternative to Conda for faster package installations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY<|>PIP<|>Tykky installations can be modified or added to using pip for small Python packages<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
