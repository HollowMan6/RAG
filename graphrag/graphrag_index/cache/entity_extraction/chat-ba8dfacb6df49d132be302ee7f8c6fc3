Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 4\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/installing_hands-on_mcl.html\n---\n\n# Installing a simple C code from source\n\nüí¨ In this tutorial we will install the MCL Markov cluster algorithm program to\nthe [`/projappl` directory](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/) of the user on\nPuhti.\n\nüí≠ This software is also available as an installation package (`.deb`, `.rpm`)\nfor various Linux distributions, but these can not be used on Puhti. Instead,\nwe install it from the source code.\n\n‚òùüèª To follow the instructions, first set an environment variable pointing to\nyour project's `/projappl` directory:\n\n```bash\nexport PROJAPPL=/projappl/<project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n## Obtaining the source code\n\n1. Create your own directory under `$PROJAPPL` (if not done already) and move\n   there. Then, create and move to a new directory for the installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p $PROJAPPL/$USER\n   cd $PROJAPPL/$USER\n   mkdir mcl\n   cd mcl\n   ```\n\n### Downloading a distribution package\n\n1. Download the distribution package:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://micans.org/mcl/src/mcl-latest.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   üí¨ In this case the installation package is a tar-archive file that has been\n   compressed with `gzip` program.\n\n2. Unpack the file with the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   tar -xvf mcl-latest.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   üí¨ After unpacking, the `ls` command shows that a new directory called\n   `mcl-14-137` has been created. This directory contains the actual\n   installation files and documentation of the software.\n\n### Alternative option: Get the software from GitHub\n\n1. Clone source code from Github:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/mcl.git\n   ```\n\n   üí¨ After cloning, the `ls` command shows that a new directory called `mcl`\n   has been created. This directory contains the actual installation files and\n   documentation of the software.\n\n## Preparing to install\n\n1. Create a new directory called `version-14-137` under the `mcl` directory for\n   the actual installation.\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir version-14-137\n   ```\n\n2. Move to the `mcl-14-137` (or `mcl` if cloning from git) directory and study\n   its contents:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd mcl-14-137\n   ls\n   ```\n\n   üí¨ Installation packages often contain short installation instructions.\n   Typically, this instructions file is called `INSTALL` or `README`.\n\n3. Read the `INSTALL` file to learn how the installation should be done.\n\n   ```bash\n   less INSTALL\n   ```\n\n   üí° Move in the file opened with `less` with up and down arrows, and exit\n   with `q`.\n\n## Installation\n\nüí¨ Many open-source software tools are installed using the so-called\n\"configure-make\" procedure following three steps:\n\n1. Configuring a so-called `Makefile` with a `./configure` script.\n2. Running the `make` command that compiles the source code according to the\n   instructions in `Makefile`.\n3. Installing the compiled executables with the command `make install`.\n\nüí≠ Normally, installation packages assume that the user has the required\npermissions to install the software to the locations where Linux binaries and\nlibraries normally get installed.\n\n- However, at CSC this is not the case. You can install software only to your\n  own (or your project's) disk areas.\n- Often you can use the option `--prefix=<path>` to tell to the `configure`\n  script where the program should be installed (replacing `<path>` with the\n  actual path).\n\nüí≠ The `./configure` script checks that all compilers and libraries that the\nsoftware needs are available.\n\n- It is not uncommon that `./configure` reports about missing libraries or\n  incorrect compilation options.\n- In such cases, you should check if the missing library or program could be\n  made available by loading a suitable module.\n\nüóØ The CSC computing environment has several compiler versions and HPC\nlibraries available.\n\n- In some cases you may, for example, need to use a specific C compiler or\n  Python version in order to install a software. Read the compilation\n  instructions carefully and try different versions if needed.\n- If the compilation still fails, don't hesitate to ask for help from the\n  [CSC Service Desk](https://docs.csc.fi/support/contact/).\n\n1. To compile `mcl`, load the GNU C compiler (`gcc`) version 9.4.0:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load gcc/9.4.0\n   ```\n\n2. In this case we wish to install the software under the `version-14-137`\n   directory in your `$PROJAPPL` area. Thus, you need to specify the custom\n   location for the installation using the `--prefix` option:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --prefix=$PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137  # double check that the path is correct\n   ```\n\n3. Compile and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
