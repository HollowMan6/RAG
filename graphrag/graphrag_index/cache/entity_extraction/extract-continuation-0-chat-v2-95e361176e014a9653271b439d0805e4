The available abstract names are\n\n- `threads` : hardware/logical thread\n- `cores`   : core (having one or more hardware threads)\n- `sockets` : socket (consisting of one or more cores)\n\nAlternatively, the `OMP_PLACES` environment variable can be defined using an\nexplicit ordered list of places with general syntax\n`<lowerbound>:<length>:<stride>`.\n\n### OpenMP binding\n\nWhile the places deal with the hardware resources, it doesn't define how the\nthreads are mapped to the places. To map of the threads to the places you use\nthe environment variable `OMP_PROC_BIND=<bind>`. The value of `<bind>` can be\none of the following values:\n\n- `spread` : distribute (spread) the threads as evenly as possible\n- `close`  : bind threads close to the master thread\n- `master` : assign the threads to the same place as the master thread\n- `false`  : allows threads to be moved between places and disables thread\n  affinity\n\nThe best options depend on the characteristics of your application. In general\nusing `spread` increase available memory bandwidth while using `close` improve\ncache locality.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used for scheduling jobs on supercomputers, clusters, and computing grids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenMP is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM<|>OPENMP<|>SLURM can manage jobs that utilize OpenMP for parallel processing, indicating a relationship in the context of high-performance computing environments<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
