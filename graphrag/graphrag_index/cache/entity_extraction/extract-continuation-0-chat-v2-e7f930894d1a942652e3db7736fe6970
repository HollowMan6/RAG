However, plain Linux tools have their limitations. If\nyou are going to do more complex data management, scripting languages\nlike Python and Perl may be more efficient tools to use. In the case of\nnumerical data, many application programs, for example R,\nprovides tools for both complex analysis tasks and automating the\nanalysis.\n\n## `grep` selects rows that match a given string\n\nThe `grep` command is used to select rows from a file. This\ncommand is very useful for picking data from large files. However, using\n`grep` requires that you are well aware of the contents of the file you\nare working with. The basic syntax of `grep` is:\n\n```bash\ngrep pattern target_file\n```\n\nThis command goes through the target file and prints out rows that\ncontain the given search pattern.  \nFor example, say we have a file called `authors.txt` that contains\nfollowing rows:\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n\nIn that case, the command:\n\n```bash\ngrep Pekka authors.txt\n```\n\nWould print two rows:\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\n```\n\nas also *Pekkanen* matches the search string *Pekka*. If we want to use\nfull names as search strings, including the space character between the\nnames, we need to embrace the search string within quotation marks. For\nexample,\n\n```bash\ngrep \"Pekka Niemi\" authors.txt\n```\n\nprints out just\n\n```text\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\n```\n\nAn inverse selection is done using option `-v`. For example, the\ncommand\n\n```bash\ngrep -v Pekka authors.txt\n```\n\nprints out\n\n```text\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n\nBy default, `grep` is case-sensitive, and thus the command\n\n```bash\ngrep pekka authors.txt\n```\n\nwould not result in any hits. With the option `-i`, `grep` ignores the\ndifference between upper and lower case letters. For example,\n\n```bash\ngrep -i pekka authors.txt\n```\n\nprints again\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 2\n```\n\n`grep` interprets the given search string as a *regular expression*, where\nsome characters have a special meaning and are interpreted as part\nof the regular expression string. The same regular expression syntax is\nused with `awk` and `sed` commands too. For example:\n\n- `.` is used to define any single character\n- `^` means the beginning of a line\n- `$` means the end of a line\n- `[ ]` matches any of the characters inside the brackets, so for\n  example `[abc]` would match a, b or c\n- `[^ ]` matches any character, except the characters inside the\n  brackets, so for example `[^abc]` would select all rows that contain\n  also other characters than just a, b and c\n- `*` matches zero or more of the preceding character or expression\n- `\\{n,m\\}` matches *n* to *m* occurrences of the preceding\n  character or expression\n\nFor example,\n\n```bash\ngrep \"i.\" authors.txt\n```\n\nprints the following two rows as the search criterion is in this case\n*i and any other character*.\n\n```text\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n\nIn these kinds of situations you can use the *backslash character* (`\\`)\nto define that the following character should not be interpreted as part\nof a regular expression. Thus, the command\n\n```bash\ngrep \"i\\.\" authors.txt\n```\n\nnow returns just one row:\n\n```text\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\n```\n\n`grep` is often used to filter the output of other commands. For\nexample, to see what files in the current directory are from the year\n2010, we can use command `ls -l` and pipe it to `grep`. With `grep` we\ncan select from the output only those rows that include the string 2010.\nHowever, some file names may contain the string \"2010\", even though they\nare not dating from 2010. To make the filtering more effective, we can\nuse quotation marks to include the space before and after the year\nnumber to the search string, `ls -l | grep \" 2010 \"`. In addition to the\nnormal `grep` command, there exist several other grep-like tools. For\nexample `zgrep` or `bzgrep` can be used to search rows from files\ncompressed with `gzip` or `bzip2`.\n\n## Using `sed` to select rows by row number\n\nThe stream editor `sed` can be used to select and modify rows\nin a text file. Many of the `grep` operations described above can be done\nwith `sed` too. The `sed` command is discussed in more detail in the chapter\n[\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux provides tools for data processing, including the modification and analysis of data files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python is a scripting language used for complex data management and analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Perl is a scripting language used for complex data management and analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R is an application program providing tools for complex numerical data analysis and automation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grep is a command-line utility in Linux used to select rows from a file that match a given string)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sed is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text in Linux)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EEVA PEKKANEN<|>PERSON<|>Eeva Pekkanen is mentioned in an example using grep, associated with Oulu and the number 50)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKUS AHO<|>PERSON<|>Markus Aho is mentioned in an example using grep, associated with Turku and the number 50)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEKKA NIEMI<|>PERSON<|>Pekka Niemi is mentioned in an example using grep, associated with Tampere and the number 26)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEENA VIRTANEN<|>PERSON<|>Leena Virtanen is mentioned in an example using grep, associated with Kuopio and the number 32)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREP<|>LINUX<|>Grep is a command-line utility provided by Linux for data processing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SED<|>LINUX<|>Sed is a stream editor provided by Linux for text transformation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>LINUX<|>Python is mentioned as a more efficient tool than plain Linux tools for complex data management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERL<|>LINUX<|>Perl is mentioned as a more efficient tool than plain Linux tools for complex data management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R<|>LINUX<|>R is mentioned as providing tools for numerical data analysis, suggesting its use on Linux systems for such tasks<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
