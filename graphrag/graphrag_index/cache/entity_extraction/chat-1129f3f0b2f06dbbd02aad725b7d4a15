This is especially useful if you want to automate your database management. This could be used in a CI/CD environment where you might want to create a new database for each commit. Application credentials could also be used if you are building a service that uses the DBaaS as a backend component for example for creating new database users on-demand for new users.\n\n## Configuration groups\n\nYou can modify your database parameter through `configuration groups`. Configuration groups are a\nconcept to store your database settings in way so that you can apply the same settings to multiple\ndatabases. Some of the parameters require a restart. The parameters depend on the database\nengine. The configuration groups can be modified from the web-GUI as well as the CLI-tool.\n\n### Example how to create a configuration group with the CLI\n\n1. Figure out which datastore, datastore-version and what values you want to create a configuration\ngroup for. In this example we will use datastore `postgresql` and datastore-version `14.4`.\n2. Figure out which parameters can be modified:\n    \n    ```bash\n    openstack database configuration parameter list --datastore postgresql 14.4\n    ```\n    \n    Note that some parameters require restarting the database instance.\n\n3. Create a configuration group. We want to call this group `group-name` and we want to modify\n`max_connections` to `234`.\n\n    ```\n    openstack database configuration create group-name --datastore postgresql \\\n        --datastore-version 14.4 '{\"max_connections\": 234 }'\n    ```\n\n4. You can see the configuration group with:\n\n    ```\n    openstack database configuration show group-name\n    ```\n\n5. You can also update the configuration group. Note that you need to use the group's `ID` and\nyou also need to define all parameters. Otherwise the old parameters will be removed. This might be\neasier to modify from the web-GUI.\n\n    ```\n    openstack database configuration set $GROUP_ID '{\"min_wal_size\": 160, \"max_connections\": 234 }'\n    ```\n\n1. Once you are happy with your configuration group you can attach it to an instance:\n\n    ```\n    openstack database configuration attach $INSTANCE_ID $CONFIGURATION_GROUP_ID\n    ```\n\n2. If your configuration group contained changes that require a restart, you will need to restart\nyour database instance.\n\n    ```\n    openstack database instance restart $INSTANCE_ID\n    ```\n\n    !!! info \"Note\"\n        You will not be able to attach a new configuration group before restarting the instance if you detached a configuration that requires a restart. Also, only one configuration group can be attached at the same time.\n\n    !!! info \"Note\"\n        No new backups will be taken of the instance before the restart has been done.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
