Please note also\nthe [Technical description about Lustre filesystem](../../computing/lustre.md)\nused in CSC supercomputers.\n\n## MPI I/O\n\nWhen performing parallel I/O with MPI (or with libraries using MPI-IO\nunderneath), disk access can be done independently or collectively. In\nindependent I/O each MPI process access the filesystem directly, while\nwith collective I/O the MPI runtime gathers/scatters data via set of\naggregator I/O tasks. Collective I/O provides typically much higher\nbandwidth than independent I/O.\n\n* Example 8 MPI processes, 4 MPI processes per computing node, collective I/O,\n  all the processes write on the same file.\n\n![\"Schematic example of 8 MPI processes, 4 MPI processes per computing node, collective I/O, all the processes write on the same file\"](../../img/aggregators.png \"MPI-IO aggregators\")\n\n*MPI-IO Aggregators example*\n\n## Improving I/O with ROMIO hints\n\nBy default, for collective I/O, the OpenMPI on Mahti uses 1 MPI I/O\naggregator per compute node. This means that in our example above,\nonly 2 MPI processes do the actual I/O. They gather the data from the\nrest of the processes (phase 1), and in the second phase they send the\ndata to the storage. The usage of the default MPI aggregators could be\nenough, but in many cases, it is not. The number of aggregators per\nnode, as well as some other parameters affecting I/O, can be adjusted\nwith ROMIO hints.\n\nAvailable hints for collective buffering (two-phase I/O) with the focus on\nLustre:\n\n| Hint                | Description                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|cb_buffer_size       | The buffer size, in bytes, of the intermediate buffer used in two-phase collective I/O                             |\n|romio_cb_read        | Collective read operations during collective buffering, values: enable, disable, automatic                         |\n|romio_cb_write       | Collective write operations during collective buffering, values: enable, disable, automatic                        |\n|romio_no_indep_rw    | Controls if no independent read/write is enabled or not, values: enable, disable, automatic                        |\n|cb_config_list       | Defines how many MPI I/O aggregators can be used per node, values: `*:X` where X aggregators per each compute node |\n|cb_nodes             | The maximum number of aggregators to be used                                                                       |\n\n\n### How can I change the MPI I/O hints?\n\nHints can be declared in a text file, as an example set the number of\nMPI I/O aggregators per node to two:\n\n```\ncb_config_list *:2\n```\n\nIn addition, environment variable `ROMIO_HINTS` needs to be set in your\nbatch job script:\n\n```\nexport ROMIO_HINTS=/path/to/file_with_hints\n```\n\nHints can be set also in the application code:\n\n```\n...\ncall MPI_Info_create(info,ierror)\ncall MPI_Info_set(info,'romio_cb_write','enable',ierror)\n...\ncall MPI_File_open(comm,filename,amode,info,fh,ierror)\n...\n```\n\nIn order to check that your declarations were really applied, the used hints\nand their values can be seen by setting in your batch job script:\n\n```\nexport ROMIO_PRINT_HINTS=1\n```\n\nIf, and only if there is collective I/O, the hints will be\nprinted in the standard output of the job, for example:\n\n```\nkey = cb_buffer_size            value = 33554432\nkey = romio_cb_read             value = enable\nkey = romio_cb_write            value = enable\nkey = cb_nodes                  value = 64\nkey = romio_no_indep_rw         value = false\nkey = romio_cb_pfr              value = disable\n...\n```\n\n\n## File per process\n\nSome applications create one file per MPI process. Although this is\neasy to implement, it is not necessarily efficient. If you use a lot\nof processes per compute node there can be contention both for the\nnetwork on the node (as all processes need to access filesystem)\nas well as for the actual I/O operations. There can be cases where\nfile per process is an efficient approach, but always be careful and\nthink about scalability, as this approach is not scalable.\n\n![\"Schematic with one file per process\"](../../img/file_per_process.png \"File Per Process\")\n\n*File Per Process*\n\n## Benchmark - NAS BTIO\n\n### Blocking I/O\n\nFor testing purposes we use the [NAS BTIO](https://github.com/wkliao/BTIO)\nbenchmark with support to PnetCDF in order to test the I/O performance on 16\ncompute nodes of Mahti.\n\nWe create an input file with:\n\n```\nw                  # IO mode:    w for write, r for read\n2                  # IO method:  0 for MPI collective I/O, 1 for MPI_independent I/O,\n                   # 2 for PnetCDF blocking I/O, 3 for PnetCDF nonblocking I/O\n5                  # number of time steps\n2048 1024 256      # grid_points(1), grid_points(2), grid_points(3)\n/scratch/project_xxxxx/BTIO/output # output filew\n```\n\nThis means that we do write operations with blocking PnetCDF, 5 time steps,\nand with a total of almost half-billion grid points. The output file will be\nalmost 105 GB.
