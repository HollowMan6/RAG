If you decide to use an\ninstallation-based method of image creation, you should look into the\nexcellent [virt-sysprep] tool that takes care of most\nmodifications necessary for cloud use with a single command line\ncommand. This chapter lists some of the caveats that need to be\nhandled before an image is ready for clouds.\n\n#### cloud-init\n\nThere is a tool called [cloud-init] that must be installed on any\nimages that are to be used in Pouta clouds. It is used for certain\ntasks that need to be run when a virtual machine first boots up\nsuch as **generating SSH host keys and adding\nuser SSH public keys.**\n\n#### User accounts (can be done with [virt-sysprep])\n\nCloud images should only have a minimal set of user accounts. Most\nlikely, they should only have one regular generic user account (e.g.\n\"cloud-user\" on the default images provided by CSC) and the root user\naccount.\n\n#### SSH host keys (can be done with [virt-sysprep])\n\nImages used in the cloud must not contain any SSH host keys, as having\nthem in the image would mean that every server launched using the\nimage would have the same identity from the point of view of SSH. It\nis also a security risk, as anyone with access to the image file would\nbe able to personate any server launched using that image file. Fresh\nSSH host keys need to be generated by _cloud-init_ (see above) when a\nvirtual machine first boots up.\n\n#### Network interface ordering (can be done with [virt-sysprep])\n\nThe _udev_ device manager in the Linux kernel has a function that \npins a specific network interface name to a specific MAC address. This\nis not good if several virtual machines are to be created from an\nimage, as all virtual machines will have different MAC\naddresses. It is also not good if you create a snapshot out of a\nvirtual machine and try to use that snapshot to launch a virtual\nmachine, as it will remember the MAC address of the old virtual\nmachine that was used to create the snapshot. The best way to do this\nis to use _virt-sysprep_.\n\n#### Partitioning\n\nWhen partitioning a Linux image, you should make sure the root\npartition is the first and only partition. During the virtual machine\nbootup process, OpenStack inserts SSH keys on the first partition\nunder the /root/.ssh directory, which means this partition must be the\nroot partition and not e.g. /boot. Logging in is not be possible\nwithout the root password unless the keys are correctly inserted.\n\n#### ACPI daemon\n\nThe ACPI daemon is used to receive commands to manage the power state\nof a virtual machine. You should install an ACPI daemon on the machine\nimages to allow proper power down/reboot in the cloud interface.\n\n#### Hotplug\n\nTo be able to use volumes, you need to have *ACPI hotplug*\nenabled. This is on by default in CentOS 6 and newer, but for Ubuntu,\nyou need to add the line \"*acpiphp*\" to */etc/modules*. For other\ndistros, please check how to load *acpiphp* on boot from the distro\ndocumentation.\n\n## Converting images\n\nWhen performing a snapshot of a virtual machine, OpenStack creates an \nimage in _raw_ format. These images typically take as many GB as the \ncapacity of the root disk of the virtual machine, regardless of the \namount of GB actually used by the customer. As a result, taking \nsnapshots can quickly deplete the space available for images.\n\nA solution to this problem is to convert the image obtained from the \nsnapshot to more compact formats, such as _qcow2_, which stores the \ncustomer data only. To do so, we download the raw image, we convert it \nto qcow2, and we upload the newly obtained image to OpenStack. Given \nthat raw images can take many GB, we do not recommend performing this \noperation on a personal computer, but to use an auxiliary virtual \nmachine within Pouta instead. In the following, we illustrate the \nprocedure using a temporary virtual machine.\n\n1. We assume we have just performed a snapshot of a virtual machine, \n   and we have thus obtained an image _myVmSnapshot_. The first step is to \n   create a temporary virtual machine that we will use to convert \n   myVmSnapshot. The virtual machine should have enough space to host \n   myVmSnapshot and its compact version at the same time. Since the \n   compact version will be smaller or of equal size of myVmSnapshot, \n   a safe choice is to select a flavor that is capable of hosting two times \n   the size of myVmSnapshot. For example, if myVmSnapshot has a size of \n   80GB, a suitable flavor for the auxiliary virtual machine is io.160GB \n   because it has 160 GB of ephemeral storage. The operating system can be \n   CentOS-7, for example.\n   ```bash\n   openstack server create --flavor <flavor> \\\n   --image <image uuid> \\\n   --key-name <key name> \\\n   --nic net-id=<name of network> \\\n   --security-group default \\\n   --security-group <additional security group> snapshotConverter\n   ```\n   The only additional requirements for the setting up of the virtual \n   machine are i) attaching a public floating IP, and ii) enabling SSH, so that \n   we can actually log into the virtual machine.\n\n2. Once the virtual machine is up and running, we copy the OpenStack \n   RC File v3 for accessing to cPouta/ePouta in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD-INIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool installed on images for Pouta clouds to handle tasks like generating SSH host keys and adding user SSH public keys upon a virtual machine's first boot)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRT-SYSPREP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for preparing virtual machine images for cloud use by handling modifications necessary for cloud deployment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides default images with a minimal set of user accounts for cloud usage, likely including a \"cloud-user\" and the root user account)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH HOST KEYS<|>EVENT<|>The process of generating fresh SSH host keys by cloud-init to ensure security and unique identity for servers in the cloud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK INTERFACE ORDERING<|>EVENT<|>The adjustment of network interface names to MAC addresses to accommodate multiple virtual machines created from the same image)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACPI DAEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A daemon installed on machine images to manage the power state of a virtual machine in the cloud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOTPLUG<|>EVENT<|>Enabling ACPI hotplug to use volumes in virtual machines, requiring specific configurations depending on the operating system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform that uses images in raw format for snapshots, which can be converted to more compact formats like qcow2 for efficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS-7<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An operating system choice for creating a temporary virtual machine to convert snapshot images to a more compact format)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD-INIT<|>Pouta CLOUDS<|>Cloud-init is specifically used for initial configurations in Pouta clouds<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRT-SYSPREP<|>SSH HOST KEYS<|>Virt-sysprep can handle the removal or regeneration of SSH host keys for cloud images<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRT-SYSPREP<|>NETWORK INTERFACE ORDERING<|>Virt-sysprep can adjust network interface ordering for cloud image deployment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACPI DAEMON<|>OPENSTACK<|>The ACPI daemon is used within OpenStack to manage virtual machine power states<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOTPLUG<|>CENTOS-7<|>Hotplug, specifically ACPI hotplug, is enabled by default in CentOS 6 and newer for volume usage in virtual machines<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>CENTOS-7<|>OpenStack supports CentOS-7 as an operating system for virtual machines, including those used for image conversion<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
