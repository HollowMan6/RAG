You've learned that moving to GPUs and CSC's supercomputers might\nbe the answer but the documentation seems a bit daunting.*\n\nCSC's computing environment is well-documented at [docs.csc.fi](../../index.md),\nbut for a newcomer it might be a bit difficult to know how to get started.\n**This guide will show you, step by step, how to get your codes and data to the\nPuhti supercomputer and running on GPUs**. It is part of our [Machine learning\nguide](ml-guide.md).\n\nCSC has several supercomputers: [Puhti](../../computing/systems-puhti.md),\n[Mahti](../../computing/systems-mahti.md) and\n[LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/). In this guide we\nwill focus on using Puhti as it has the widest selection of software, and has a\nweb user interface, making it very easy to access.\n\nWhen you are moving your code from your laptop to the Puhti supercomputer, it's\nimportant to acknowledge that Puhti isn't just a \"faster laptop\". Because of the\nfundamental difference in scale, some things work quite differently in a\nsupercomputer. So **be prepared to take a step back and relearn some things\nabout how computing is done**. We consider this a reasonable price to pay for\ngetting access to Finland's most powerful GPU resource for researchers!\n\n!!! note\n\n    While this guide tries to explain every step carefully, it is still recommended\n    to have at least a basic familiarity with the Linux command line, as you will\n    need to use that for a few of the steps. You can, for example, take a look at\n    the first section of our [Linux basics tutorial](env-guide/index.md).\n\n\n## Step 1: Get a CSC user account\n\nFirst of all, you need to get a CSC user account, if you don't have one already.\nIf you work or study at a Finnish university just **go to the My CSC portal at\n[my.csc.fi](https://my.csc.fi) and click \"Get Started\"**. Select Haka-Login and\nyour university from the pull-down menu. After that you should be able to log in\nwith your normal university credentials. Fill in your information on the *Sign\nup*-page. Once you're done, you should get a confirmation email.\n\nFor more information, and special cases, check our separate [\"How to create new\nuser account\" documentation](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md).\n\n## Step 2: Join an existing project, or create a new one\n\nSecond, you need to belong to a computing project. This is because CSC needs to\nkeep track of how our resources are used, and computing projects are the\nmechanism for that. \n\nIf you are part of a research group, **ask your professor or group leader if you\nalready have a CSC project that you can join**. If that is the case the manager\nof the project (most likely the professor) can add you to the project via the\n[My CSC portal](https://my.csc.fi). Check our more [detailed documentation on\nhow to add a new user to a\nproject](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md)\n\nOtherwise, for example if you are working on your own doctoral thesis project,\nyou can create your own project. **To create a new project, go to [My\nCSC](https://my.csc.fi)** and log in as in Step 1 above. Choose *My Projects*\nand click the *New project* button. Give your project a name, and describe\nbriefly the research you are doing. \"Academic\" is probably the appropriate\ncategory in most cases. For more information, check our \"[Creating a new\nproject\" documentation](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md).\n\nOnce your project is created you also need to **add Puhti access to your\nproject**. See [Adding service access for a\nproject](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) for more\ninformation on that.\n\n**Make a note of the unix group of the project**, which is typically something\nlike `project_2001234`. In the remainder of this document we will use\n`project_2001234` as a placeholder whenever we are referring to the unix group\nof the project, but **remember to always replace that with your actual project\nnumber**.\n\n## Step 3: Log in to Puhti\n\nThere are many ways to access Puhti. The traditional way is via an SSH client\ngiving you a purely text based command line access to the Linux system running\non Puhti. However, here **we recommend the Puhti web interface accessible via a\nweb browser at [puhti.csc.fi](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)**. Log in with the\nusername and password created in Step 1 of this guide.\n\n!!! note\n\n    If you have just created your account minutes ago, it might be that it\n    hasn't yet been activated on Puhti. Just go get a coffee, or beverage of\n    your choice, and try again in a\n    few minutes! &nbsp;  ☕\n\nAfter logging in, you will see the Puhti web interface, which looks something\nlike this:\n\n![Puhti web interface front page](../../img/ood_main.png)\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Puhti's web interface (based on [Open\nOnDemand][OOD]), take some time to familiarize yourself\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides supercomputing resources and support for researchers, including access to Puhti, Mahti, and LUMI supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of CSC's supercomputers, offering a wide selection of software and a web user interface for easy access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another supercomputer provided by CSC, mentioned as part of CSC's computing resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is one of the supercomputers provided by CSC, known for its hardware capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY CSC PORTAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The portal for accessing CSC services, including user account management and project creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINLAND<|>GEO<|>Country where CSC's supercomputing resources are located and available to researchers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a supercomputer provided by CSC for researchers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC<|>Mahti is a supercomputer provided by CSC, as part of its computing resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>CSC<|>LUMI is one of the supercomputers provided by CSC, highlighting its computing capabilities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY CSC PORTAL<|>CSC<|>My CSC Portal is the platform through which users can access CSC services, including account and project management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>FINLAND<|>CSC provides supercomputing resources within Finland, available to Finnish researchers<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
