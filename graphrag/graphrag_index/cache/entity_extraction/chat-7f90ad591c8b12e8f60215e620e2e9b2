Warning\n    If your `PersistentVolumeClaim` is `ReadWriteOnce`, you have to scale down the `nginx` deployment to let the pod running rclone mount the volume.\n    Use this command to proceed: `oc scale --replicas=0 deploy/nginx`\n    If your `PersistentVolumeClaim` is `ReadWriteMany`, there is no need to scale down your deployment.\n    You can verify with this command: `oc get pvc`. You should see either `RWO` or `RWX`.\n\nThe pod will run and backup the content of your PVC to Allas. Don't forget to scale up your origin deployment (`oc scale --replicas=1 deploy/nginx`) after the copy finished.\n\nThere are PROS and CONS with this solution:  \nPros: \n\n  - You run the pod in your Rahti 2 project\n\nCons: \n\n  - The PVC is `ReadWriteOnce` hence a downtime is necessary.\n\n### Second example: using bash script\n\nFor the following script to work, we assume that you have the `rclone` command-line program installed and Allas bucket name is created. The `rclone.conf` should be set on your local system like described above example. For example, `rclone.conf` path could be located in `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`. More information on creating [Allas bucket](../../../data/Allas/using_allas/rclone.md). This script will backup an application deployed in Rahti 2. The application has, for example the name `/backup`, as the `volumeMounts` `mountPath`.\n\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/env bash\n\n# Set your pod name, source directory, and destination directory\nif [[ -z $1 ]];\nthen\n    echo \"No Podname parameter passed.\"\n    exit 22\nelse\n     echo \"The POD_NAME = $1 is set.\"\nfi\n\nPOD_NAME=$1\nSOURCE_DIR=\"/backup\"\nTIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S') # Generate a timestamp\nDEST_DIR=\"/tmp/pvc_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz\" # Include the timestamp in the filename\nRCLONE_CONFIG_PATH=\"your/path/to/rclone.conf\"\nS3_BUCKET=\"pvc-test-allas\" # Your bucket name\n\n# Echo function to display task messages\necho_task() {\n  echo \"$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1\"\n}\n\n# Function to handle errors\nhandle_error() {\n  echo_task \"Error: $1\"\n  exit 1\n}\n\n# Check if the pod exists\noc get pod \"$POD_NAME\" &>/dev/null\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n  echo_task \"Pod $POD_NAME not found. Aborting backup.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Create a tar archive within the pod\necho_task \"Creating a tar archive within the pod...\"\noc exec \"$POD_NAME\" -- /bin/sh -c \"tar -czf /tmp/pvc_backup.tar.gz -C $SOURCE_DIR .\"\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n  handle_error \"Failed to create a tar archive in the pod. Aborting backup.\"\nfi\n\n# Copy the tar archive to the local machine\necho_task \"Copying the tar archive to the local machine...\"\noc cp \"$POD_NAME:/tmp/pvc_backup.tar.gz\" \"$DEST_DIR\"\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n  handle_error \"Failed to copy the tar archive to the local machine. Aborting backup.\"\nfi\necho_task \"Backup completed successfully. The archive is stored in $DEST_DIR.\"\n\n# Use Rclone to sync the tarball to S3\necho_task \"Syncing the tarball to S3...\"\nrclone --config \"$RCLONE_CONFIG_PATH\" sync \"$DEST_DIR\" default:\"$S3_BUCKET\"\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n  handle_error \"Failed to upload tarball to S3\"\nfi\necho_task \"Backup completed successfully. The archive is stored in $S3_BUCKET$DEST_DIR\"\n\nexit 0\n\n```\n\nIf you need to clean up the tar archive files, you can add the following script after storing to Allas.\n\n```bash\n# Clean up the tar archive in the pod\noc exec \"$POD_NAME\" -- /bin/sh -c \"rm /tmp/pvc_backup.tar.gz\"\n\n# Clean up temporary files\nrm -rf /tmp/pvc_backup*\nor\nrm \"$DEST_DIR\"\n\n```\nThe script can be run as follows, assuming the script name is `push_to_allas.sh` and it is executable:\n\n```bash\n./push_to_allas.sh \"mypod-vol\"\n```\n\nThere are PROS and CONS with this solution:\n\nPros:\n\n  - Simplicity: You're essentially treating the volume just like any other directory. It's straightforward to copy data from a directory to Allas.\n  - Flexibility: You can select specific files or directories within the mount to copy to Allas and ideal for small size files.\n\nCons:\n\n  -\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
