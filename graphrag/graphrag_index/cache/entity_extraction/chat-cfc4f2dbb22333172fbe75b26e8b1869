Open the Crypt4GH application and press _Select File_. This will allow you to access a small browser that you can use to select the File that needs to be encrypted.  \n\n4. Click on _Open_. The file name will be displayed under _File to encrypt_. Next, press on _Encrypt_.\n\n5. The Cryot4GH application will create an encrypted file in the same folder as the original file, with the extension being `.c4gh`. For example, encrypting the file `my_data1.csv` will produce a new, encrypted file named `my_data.csv.c4gh`. Unfortunately, the Cryp4GH application does not provide a progress bar, and the encryption process can last up to several minutes.\n[![SDConnect-cryp4ghapplication](images/connect/connect_encryption_large.png)](images/connect/connect_encryption_large.png)\n\n6. Now, you can upload the encrypted file (or a folder containing encrypted data) to SD Connect using the drag-and-drop function.\n\n7. Next, you will be redirected to a new page. Here deselect the option: _Encrypt file before Upload._\n\n8. Next, you can specify the bucket name to which the data should be uploaded. If you don't fill in a specific name, the user interface will automatically create a bucket named: `upload-nnn` (where `nnn` is replaced with a 13-digit number based on creation time). Note that it is not possible to rename buckets.\nIf you create a new bucket, use the following suggestions to name it. Bucket names must be unique across all existing buckets in all projects in SD-Connect and Allas. If you can't create a new bucket, some other projects may already use the name you want to use. To avoid this situation, it is good practice to include project-specific identifiers (e.g. project ID number or acronym) in the bucket names. Avoid using spaces and special characters in bucket names. Preferred characters are Latin alphabets (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), dash (`-`), underscore (`_`), and dot (`.`). SD Connect can also support other characters, but they may cause problems in other interfaces. All bucket names are public, so please do not include any confidential information in the bucket names.\n\n9. Next, click on _Upload_. A progress bar will visualize the upload's status. Once the process is completed, you can return to the SD Connect browser window, open the bucket and visualize the encrypted file, here named `.c4hg`.\n\n[![SDConnect-upload-encrypted](images/connect/connect_encryption_large_upload.png)](images/connect/connect_encryption_large_upload.png)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
