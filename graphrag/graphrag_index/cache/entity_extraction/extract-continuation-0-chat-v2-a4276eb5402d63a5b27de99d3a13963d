The main emphasis is on assembling, taxonomic binning and taxonomic profiling of bacterial/viral sequences.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OverZealous/lazypipe/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Available\n\nLazypipe 3.0 is available in Puhti.\n\n## Usage\n\nAll components of Lazypipe pipeline are available in Puhti. The [Lazypipe home page](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/lazypipe) provides detailed instruction how to set up your own Lazypipe environment to Puhti, but this is not needed if you use the Lazypipe module that is activated with commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load r-env\nmodule load biokit\nmodule load lazypipe\n```\n\nNow Lazypipe starts with commands:\n\n```bash\ncp /appl/soft/bio/lazypipe/3.0/lazypipe/config.yaml config.yaml\necho tmpdir: \\\"$(pwd)/tmpdir\\\" >> config.yaml\necho res: \\\"$(pwd)/tmpdir\\\" >> config.yaml\nlazypipe.pl -h\n```\n\nNormally you need to use the `lazypipe.pl` command only for testing. For real analysis tasks lazypipe module includes `sbatch-lazypipe` command that you can use instead. \n\n`sbatch-lazypipe` is a help tool that automatically generates a configuration file and a batch job file for a Lazypipe run \nand submits the job to batch job system of Puhti. The command uses the same command line options \nas the `lazypipe.pl` command. In addition `sbatch-lazypipe` asks user to define batch job resources\n(account, run time, memory, number of cores).\n\nFor example, to execute the [Example 1](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/lazypipe/examples) from the\nLazypipe User manual, you would first need to download the reads and reference genome to your scratch directory in Puhti\n(in real cases you will get these input files from your own sources):\n\n```bash\nmkdir /scratch/my_project/data\nmkdir /scratch/my_project/hostgen\ncp /appl/soft/bio/lazypipe/3.0/lazypipe/data/samples/M15small_R*.fastq /scratch/my_project/data\nwget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/900/108/605/GCA_900108605.1_NNQGG.v01/GCA_900108605.1_NNQGG.v01_genomic.fna.gz -P /scratch/my_project/hostgen/\n```\n\nWhen you have the data available you can submit the task with commands:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/my_project\nmodule load r-env\nmodule load biokit\nmodule load lazypipe\nsbatch-lazypipe -1 data/M15/M15small_R1.fastq -S M15 -p main --anns norm\\\n--hostgen genomes_host/GCA_900108605.1_NNQGG.v01_genomic.fna.gz -v\n```\n\nWhen the `sbatch-lazypipe` is executed, it interactively asks information that is\nneeded to construct a batch job. This includes following items (default values in brackets will be\nused if no new value is defined):\n\n*   accounting project\n*   maximum duration of the job (default 24 hours)\n*   memory reservation (default 32G)\n*   number of computing cores to use (default 8)\n*   email notifications\n   \nAfter that your Lazypipe task is submitted to the batch job system for execution.\n\n## More information\n\n*   [Lazypipe home page](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/lazypipe)\n*   [Lazypipe UserGuide](https://bitbucket.org/plyusnin/lazypipe/wiki/UserGuide.v3.0)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAZYPIPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lazypipe is a stand-alone pipeline for identifying viruses in host-associated or environmental samples, emphasizing assembling, taxonomic binning, and profiling of bacterial/viral sequences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computational resource where Lazypipe 3.0 is available and all components of Lazypipe pipeline can be accessed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIT LICENSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MIT License is a free and open source license under which Lazypipe is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Helsinki provides detailed instructions on setting up Lazypipe environment in Puhti and hosts the Lazypipe home page)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAZYPIPE<|>PUHTI<|>Lazypipe 3.0 is available and fully supported on Puhti, indicating a deployment and usage relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAZYPIPE<|>MIT LICENSE<|>Lazypipe is available under the MIT License, indicating a licensing relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAZYPIPE<|>UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI<|>The University of Helsinki hosts the Lazypipe home page and provides detailed instructions for its setup and use, indicating a support and development relationship<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
