Option `-m` is used to add a description line to the metadata object that a-put creates.\n\n## 5. Using Apptainer containers in SD Desktop\n\nIn order to use the apptainer container you have created you need first download a copy of the container to the SD Desktop with _Data Gateway_ tool. First login to [SD Desktop](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi) and connect to the Virtual Desktop that you want to use. Open Data Gateway, navigate then to the right project (`project_2000123`) and bucket (`2000123_apptainer_sd`), and download the Apptainer image file (`sd_tools_1.sif`) to the SD Desktop.\n\nAfter that, open a Linux terminal in the SD Desktop. In the terminal, move the Apptainer file to the location you want to use it. In this example that could be done with command:\n\n```text\ncp /home/kkayttaj/Projects/SD-connect/project_2000123/2000123_apptainer_sd/sd_tools_1.sif ./\n```\n\nNow we could execute for example the samtools command that is installed in the container.\n\n```text\napptainer exec sd_tools_1.sif samtools\n```\n\nThe command above prints out the help for samtools version 1.10 that is installed in the container. Note that another version of samtools, version 1.9, is installed in the SD Desktop, so the command below would work too, but it would print help of the older samtools version:\n\n```text\nsamtools --help\n```\n\nWhen using the Apptainer container, you should note that it has its own file system that is read-only. In addition to this static file system Apptainer mounts selected directories from the host system into the container environment. These bind mounts can be used to import data to the container, and they are also the only places into which new data can be written.\n\nBy default, Apptainer bind mounts **home directory** (`/home/$USER`), `/tmp`, and **current working directory** (`$PWD`) into your container at runtime. If you need to mount additional directories youÂ will need to define them with singularity option `-B source-directory:target-directory`.\n\nFor example if we have input file `input_bam.bam` current working directory, it is automatically accessible for a command that is executed inside the container. But if we need also another input file `reference.bed` which locates in directory called `/data`, then we should add that directory to the list of bind-mounted directories. For example:\n\n```text\napptainer -B /data:/data exec sd_tools_1.sif samtools depth -a -b /data/refrence.bed input_bam.bam > result.depth\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer is a container platform used for executing applications in a reproducible and secure environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Desktop is a virtual desktop environment provided by CSC.fi for scientific computing and data analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA GATEWAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Data Gateway is a tool used within SD Desktop for downloading container images and other data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMTOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Samtools is a software package used for processing sequences in bioinformatics, installed inside the Apptainer container)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>SD DESKTOP<|>Apptainer containers can be used within the SD Desktop environment for executing applications<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>DATA GATEWAY<|>Apptainer images can be downloaded to SD Desktop using the Data Gateway tool<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>SAMTOOLS<|>Samtools is installed in the Apptainer container and can be executed within it<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
