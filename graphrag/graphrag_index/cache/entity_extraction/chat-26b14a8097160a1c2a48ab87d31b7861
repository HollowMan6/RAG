While the user's local\ncomputer is normally used mainly through a graphical user interface,\nthe remote usage of the servers of CSC is in most cases based on\nworking on command-line: instead of using mouse and command menus,\nthe user types commands to a screen called terminal or console.\nEven though more and more tools provided by CSC can be used through\n[graphical interfaces](../../../computing/webinterface/index.md), using\nthe basic Linux commands is in many cases still the most efficient way.\n\nThis tutorial provides an introduction to the usage of the Linux\nenvironment of CSC. Puhti is used in the examples, but the same\ncommands can be used in the other servers of CSC, too. If you\nare using Linux or macOS machine, you can also use most of\nthe commands in a terminal on your local machine. Once you are\nfamiliar with the basic Linux commands, you can continue to\ntopics that go deeper to the file and data management commands of\nLinux systems.\n\nThis guide is accurate for bash shell only. Bash is the default\ncommand shell in the CSC computing environment. We recommend to\nstick with this choice if no special reason for another shell\nflavor is given.\n\n* [**Using Linux in command-line**](using-linux-in-command-line.md)\n    * [Files and directories in Linux](using-linux-in-command-line.md#files-and-directories-in-linux)\n    * [Structure of Linux commands](using-linux-in-command-line.md#structure-of-linux-commands)\n    * [Basic commands for using directories](using-linux-in-command-line.md#basic-commands-for-using-directories)\n    * [Basic commands for files](using-linux-in-command-line.md#basic-commands-for-files)\n    * [Special characters](using-linux-in-command-line.md#special-characters)\n* [**Editing text and viewing images**](text-and-image-processing.md)\n    * [nano](text-and-image-processing.md#nano)\n    * [Emacs](text-and-image-processing.md#emacs)\n    * [vi and Vim](text-and-image-processing.md#vim)\n    * [Image and PostScript viewers](text-and-image-processing.md#image-and-postscript-viewers)\n* [**Working with bash shell**](working-with-bash-shell.md)\n    * [Automatic tab completion](working-with-bash-shell.md#automatic-tab-completion)\n    * [Stopping programs and running programs in background](working-with-bash-shell.md#stopping-programs-and-running-programs-in-background)\n* [**More commands for managing files**](more-commands-for-managing-files.md)\n    * [Using `find` to locate files](more-commands-for-managing-files.md#using-find-to-locate-files)\n    * [`file` command tells the file type](more-commands-for-managing-files.md#file-command-tells-the-file-type)\n    * [Count rows and characters with `wc`](more-commands-for-managing-files.md#count-rows-and-characters-with-wc)\n    * [Comparing two files with `diff`](more-commands-for-managing-files.md#comparing-two-files-with-diff)\n    * [Using checksums to verify successful data storage or transfer](more-commands-for-managing-files.md#using-checksums-to-verify-successful-data-storage-or-transfer)\n    * [Encrypting files with GPG](more-commands-for-managing-files.md#encrypting-files-with-gpg)\n    * [Managing access permissions of files and directories](more-commands-for-managing-files.md#managing-access-permissions-of-files-and-directories)\n* [**Commands for data processing**](commands-for-data-processing.md)\n    * [`grep` selects rows that match a given string](commands-for-data-processing.md#grep-selects-rows-that-match-a-given-string)\n    * [Using `sed` to select rows by row number](commands-for-data-processing.md#using-sed-to-select-rows-by-row-number)\n    * [Simple column selection with `cut`](commands-for-data-processing.md#simple-column-selection-with-cut)\n    * [Using `awk` to work with columns](commands-for-data-processing.md#using-awk-to-work-with-columns)\n    * [Using `sort` to order rows](commands-for-data-processing.md#using-sort-to-order-rows)\n    * [Removing duplicate rows with `uniq`](commands-for-data-processing.md#removing-duplicate-rows-with-uniq)\n    * [Replacing characters with `tr`](commands-for-data-processing.md#replacing-characters-with-tr)\n    * [Replacing words and strings with `sed`](commands-for-data-processing.md#replacing-words-and-strings-with-sed)\n* [**Packing and compression tools**](packing-and-compression-tools.md)\n    * [tar: packing several files into one file](packing-and-compression-tools.md#tar-packing-several-files-into-one-file)\n    * [Compressing files](packing-and-compression-tools.md#compressing-files)\n        * [gzip and gunzip](packing-and-compression-tools.md#gzip-and-gunzip)\n        * [bzip2 and bunzip2](packing-and-compression-tools.md#bzip2-and-bunzip2)\n        * [zip and unzip: the combined compression and file archiving tool](packing-and-compression-tools.md#zip-and-unzip-the-combined-compression-and-file-archiving-tool)\n        * [7zip packing and compression tool](packing-and-compression-tools.md#7zip-packing-and-compression-tool)\n        * [Zstandard compression tool](packing-and-compression-tools.md#zstandard-compression-tool)\n* [**Linux bash scripts**](linux-bash-scripts.md)\n    * [Constructing a script file\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
