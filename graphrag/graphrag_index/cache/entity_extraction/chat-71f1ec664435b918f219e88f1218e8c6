Note that in these cases each item (file or directory) will be stored as a separate object. For example, say that we have a directory called _job123_ that contains files _input1.txt_, _input2.txt_ and _program.py_. In addition there are directories _output_dir_1_ and _output_dir_2_ .\n\nCommand:\n```text\na-put job123/output_dir_1 jobs123/input1.txt\n```\nuploads content of _output_dir_1_ to object _job123/output_dir_1.tar_ and _input1.txt_ to _job123/input1.txt_.\n\nSimilarly command\n```text\na-put job123/output_dir*\n```\nuploads content of _output_dir_1_ to object _job123/output_dir_1.tar_ and content of _output_dir_2_ to object _job123/output_dir_2.tar_. \n\nDuring upload datasets that are larger than 5 GB will be split and stored as several objects. This is done automatically to a bucket that is named by adding extension `_segments` to the original bucket name. For example, if you would upload a large file to  bucket  _kkayttaj-12345-MISC_ the actual data would be stored as several pieces into bucket _kkayttaj-12345-MISC_segments_. The target bucket (_kkayttaj-12345-MISC_) would contain just a front object that contains information what segments make the stored dataset. Operations performed to the front object are automatically reflected to the segments. Normally users don't need to operate with the segments buckets at all and objects inside these buckets should not be deleted or modified.\n\n\n## a-check<a name=\"a-check\"></a>\n\nThis command goes through the Allas object names, that a corresponding `a-put` command would create, and then checks if object with the same name already exists in Allas. The main purpose of this command is to provide a tool to check if a large `a-put` command was successfully executed. `a-check` accepts the same command line options as `a-put`.\n\nFor example, if a dataset is uploaded with command:\n```text\na-put job123/*\n```\nThe upload can be checked with command: \n```text\na-check job123/*\n```\nThe _a-check_ command compares the item names to be uploaded to the matching objects in Allas.\nThe files or directories that don't have a target object Allas, are reported and stored to a file:\nmissing_bucket-name_number. If some of the objects in the sample commands above would be missing, then\na-check would list the missing files and directories in file `missing_job123_67889` (the number in the end is\njust a random number).\n\nThis file of missing items can be used with a-put option --input-list, to continue the failed upload process:\n```text\na-put --input-list missing_job123_67889\n```\n\nYou should note, that _a-check_ does does not check if the actual contents of the object is correct. It checks only the object names, which may originate from some other sources.\n\nIn addition to checking, if upload was successful, _a-check_ can be used to do a \"dry-run\" test for _a-put_ to see, what objects will be created or replaced before running the actual _a-put_ command. \n\n\n## a-list<a name=\"a-list\"></a>\n\na-list is used to show the names of buckets and objects stored to Allas. a-list is designed to be used for objects uploaded with _a-put_ but it shows objects that have been uploaded with other tools too. However, it doesn't show the _ameta_ metadata file files created by a-put, to keep the object listings shorter.\n\n### a-list examples\n\nList all buckets belonging to a project:\n```text\na-list\n```\nDisplay the objects included in a bucket:\n```text\na-list bucket_name\n```\nTyping a part of an object's name lists a subset of objects:\n```text\na-list bucket_name/beginning_of_the_object\n```\nA more detailed listing, containing object size and date can be obtained with option `-l`\n```text\na-list -l \n```\nOption `-d` make a-list to interpret /-characters in object names as pseudofolder separators.\n```text\na-list -d \n```\n\n## a-publish<a name=\"a-publish\"></a>\n\n`a-publish` copies a file to Allas in a bucket that can be publicly accessed. Thus, anyone with the address (URL) of the \nuploaded data object can read and download the data with a web browser or tools like _wget_ and _curl_. \na-publish works similarly to a-put with some differences: \n\n1) a-publish can upload only files, not directories. \n2) The access control of the target bucket is set so that it is available for any user in read-only mode.\n\nThe basic syntax:\n```text\na-publish file_name\n```\nBy default, the file is uploaded to the bucket _username-projectNumber_-pub. You can define other bucket names using the option _-b_. You should note that this command makes all data in the target bucket publicly accessible, including data that has been previously uploaded to the bucket.\n\nThe public URL of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
