Moreover, it is possible to use only a fraction of a\nnode and its various resources. The billing scheme charges billing units (BU)\nin a fair way based on the reserved amount of node resources.\n\nIn the billing scheme, the BU consumption rate of a compute job depends\nlinearly on the number of requested cores, the number of requested GPUs and the\namount of requested memory. More precisely:\n\n* Each reserved core consumes **1** BU per hour.\n* Each GiB of reserved memory consumes **0.1** BU per hour.\n* Each reserved GiB of NVMe disk (if available) consumes **0.006** BU per hour.\n* Each reserved GPU consumes **60** BU per hour.\n\nThe total BU consumption per hour is the sum of the above terms:\n\n```\nTotal BU = ( NCores * 1 + MemGiBs * 0.1 + NVMeGiBs * 0.006 + NGPUs * 60 ) * Walltime hours\n```\n\n## Mahti compute billing\n\nIn contrast to Puhti, in Mahti resources are used and billed per node in all\nnormal partitions. In the interactive partition, which can be used for\ninteractive work, as well as for small scale pre- and postprocessing, the usage\nis billed per CPU core. The GPU nodes in Mahti are billed according to the number\nof reserved GPUs. Memory is not billed separately.\n\n* Each reserved CPU node consumes **100** BU per hour.\n* In interactive partition each core consumes **1** BU per hour.\n* Each reserved A100 GPU consumes **100** BU per hour, or in total **400** BU per\n  hour for a full GPU node.\n* A slice of an A100 GPU with one seventh of an A100 (a100_1g.5gb) consumes **15** BU per hour \n\n## Scratch disk billing\n\nPuhti and Mahti have the same billing for scratch storage. Usage up to 1 TiB is free of charge. \n\n* Excess usage beyond 1 TiB is billed: 1 TiB consumes **5** BU per hour.\n\n## ProjAppl disk billing\n\nPuhti and Mahti have the same billing for scratch storage.
