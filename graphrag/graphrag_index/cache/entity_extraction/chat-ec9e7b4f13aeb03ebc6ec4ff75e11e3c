If you do not want to grant access to all members in the application, you can remove additional members. Adding members is also possible.\n\n- **Change the applicant**. You can change the applicant to another member of the application. This can be useful if, for example, the original applicant has left the applying organisation.\n\n- **Change the resources of the application**. If the applicant is applying for access rights to multiple datasets, and you do not want to grant access to all of them, you can remove some of the datasets. It is also possible to add new resources if they can be applied for using the same application form. These will show as available in the drop-down list.\n\n!!! note\n    You can comment on the application throughout the application process by selecting *Remark* and choosing if you want to show the comment to the applicant or not. Applicants will receive a notification about new public comments. Sometimes it is useful for the applicant to see the comments so that they know how the approval process is proceeding. Note that the applicant cannot respond to the comments.\n\n## Step 4: After processing the application\n\nYou are able to manage the access rights of the applicant even after you have processed the application. You can find the processed applications from the \"Actions\" tab under \"Processed applications\". \"Processed applications\" view shows all the applications that have been approved, rejected, closed, or returned to the applicant. Select *View* to open a specific application.\n\n### Close the application\n\nClosing the application cancels the access rights of the applicant and other application members. When the applicant and the application members do not need the access rights anymore, for example because their research period has ended, you can cancel their access rights by selecting *Close application*.\n\n### Revoke access rights\n\nIf the applicant has been granted access rights, but they misuse them, you can revoke the rights by selecting *Revoke entitlement*. Revoking will add the applicant and all the application members to a blacklist. This means that if any of them tries to apply for access rights to the same dataset again, SD Apply will warn the application handlers. The owner of the dataset can edit the blacklist. You can find the blacklist from the \"Administration\" tab.\n\n## Email notifications\n\nYou will receive email notifications about the actions of other SD Apply users. A Data Access Committee has often more than one member. Therefore, all the DAC members who have been assigned to a certain dataset, receive an email notification when one of the DAC members has processed an application.\n\nYou can see and edit your email address from the \"Settings\" tab in the top right corner of the page.\n\nYou will be notified when another handler has:\n\n- commented an application.\n\n- returned the application to the applicant.\n\n- approved an application.\n\n- rejected an application.\n\n- closed an application.\n\n- revoked the access rights of the applicant.\n\nYou will also receive notifications when an applicant has submitted or resubmitted an application.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
