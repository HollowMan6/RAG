We are using noVNC because\nit allows us to use our browser to access the desktop, i.e. no \nlocal installations needed. If you would like to have\ninstructions on how to use a GPU instance for rendering look\nhere: [How to use cPouta GPU for rendering](how-to-use-cpouta-gpu-for-rendering.md)\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Preparations\nWe will utilize the following technologies to install the remote desktop:\n\n  - A standard-flavor, for example, _standard.medium_ \n  - CentOS-7 image (In Pouta they have already the epel-repository installed)\n  - snapd to install the noVNC\n  - noVNC, since it allows us to use our browser instead of a traditional VNC-client to view the desktop\n  - tigervnc-server as our VNC server\n  - Xfce as our Desktop environment\n  - ssh-tunnel so that the VNC server is not open to the internet. This is very\nimportant.\n\n## Create and access your instance for remote desktop\n\n1. Launch a standard-flavor instance with the CentOS-7 image.\n2. Attach a floating IP to the instance.\n3. In the security rules allow ingress ssh (port 22).\n4. We will ssh into the instance with this command and create a ssh-tunnel. \n```\nssh -L2001:localhost:6081 cloud-user@YOUR-FLOATING-IP\n```\nThis also works at least in the Windows Powershell. If you don't have\nan ssh-agent running, you will need to specify also your ssh-key:\n```\nssh -i C:\\users\\localusername\\.ssh\\yourkey.pem -L2001:localhost:6081 cloud-user@YOUR-FLOATING-IP\n```\nNote, that the port 2001 is the one that you will use with the browser later.\n    \n`-L2001:localhost:6081` means that we will be able to access port 6081 on the server\nfrom our computer's local port 2001. Keep the terminal alive. The ssh-command is the only step\nneeded on the local computer.\n\n## Install the required software on the VM\n\nIn this example we are using Xfce for our Desktop Environment. If you want to use\nsome other Desktop environment you will probably need to modify the\nxstartup script.\n\n```\nsudo yum group install Xfce\n```\n\nInstall snapd for noVNC and tigervnc for the vncserver (epel-release should already be installed)\n\n```\nsudo yum install -y epel-release snapd tigervnc-server\n```\n\nStart the snapd service so that we can install the noVNC\n\n```\nsudo systemctl start snapd\n```\n\nInstall noVNC\n\n```\nsudo snap install novnc\n```\n\n## Configure our software\n\nCreate a base configure for the user you want to be able to use the remote desktop.\n\n```\nmkdir ~/.vnc\ntouch /home/cloud-user/.Xauthority\n```\n\nConfigure a resolution you would like to use. 1920x1080 is a common resolution\nbut this have been tested to work with an resolution as big as 3840x2160 .\n\n```\necho \"geometry=1920x1080\" > ~/.vnc/config\n```\n\nConfigure the startup script.\n\n```\necho '#!/bin/sh\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\nxrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nstartxfce4 --display=:1 &' > ~/.vnc/xstartup\n```\n\nAdd execution permission if you do not do this you will get a blank screen.\n\n```\nchmod +x /home/cloud-user/.vnc/xstartup\n```\n\n## Starting your remote desktop\n\nNote, that with this documentation the NoVNC session will only work with ':1'.\nStart vncserver\n\n```\nvncserver :1\n```\n\nThe first time you start the server it will ask you to create a password. Please\ndo not reuse one of your other password for this, since the password is not\nencrypted securely and can only be between 6 and 8 characters long. If you\nforget your password you should be able change the password with the `vncpasswd`\ncommand.\n\nYou can start the noVNC client by running\n\n```\n/var/lib/snapd/snap/bin/novnc --listen 6081 --vnc localhost:5901\n```\n\nThe application location might differ based on the Linux distribution you are using.\nThe `--listen 6081` means on which port the service will be accessed from. The\n`--vnc localhost:5901` means on what port it is expecting the vncserver to be \naccessed from. You can exit out of the noVNC session by `ctrl+c`.\n\nYou should now be able to access the noVNC session by going to this link in\nyour browser `http://127.0.0.1:2001/vnc.html` . Note, that the port number is the\nsame as the one you used with the ssh-command.\n\nYou can see your vncserver sessions by running the following command.\n\n```\nvncserver -list\n```\n\nTo kill a VNC session you can run the command (change ':1' to the session number)\n\n```\nvncserver -kill :1\n```\n\n## Important information if you don't want to use the ssh-tunnel\n\nIt is of course also possible to use noVNC or VNC directly\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
