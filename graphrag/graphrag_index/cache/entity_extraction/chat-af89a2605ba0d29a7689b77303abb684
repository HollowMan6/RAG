For example:\n```\nmodule load samtools/0.1.19\n```\n\nLoading SAMtools 1.x also loads BCFtools and HTSlib.\n\nHeavier SAMtool jobs should be executed as batch jobs. Below is a sample batch job file, \nfor running a SAMtools job in Puhti:\n\n```text\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=samtools\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=04:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem=4000\n#SBATCH --account=project_1234567\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n\n#Convert SAM file to BAM\nsamtools view -bS aln.sam > aln.bam\n\n#Sort the bam file\nsamtools sort aln.bam aln-sorted\n\n#Index the bam file\nsamtools index aln-sorted.bam\n```\nIn the batch job example above one task (-n 1) is executed. The maximum duration of the job is four hours \n(-t 04:00:00 ) and the reserved memory size is about 4 GB (--mem=4000). You must cange the --account \nsetting, so that it defines the project from which the computing will be billed.\n\nYou can submit the batch job file to the batch job system with command:\n```text\nsbatch batch_job_file.bash\n```\nCheck the [Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md) for more information about running batch jobs.\n\n\n## More information\n\n-    [SAMtools home page](http://www.htslib.org/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
