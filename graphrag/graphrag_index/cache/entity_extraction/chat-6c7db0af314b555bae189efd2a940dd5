Printing out the keys\n\n```bash\ngrep key $HOME/.s3cfg\n```\n\nNow return to the Nextcloud WWW-interface and log in as the admin. \nClick the round symbol on the right end of the blue menu bar and select _+Apps_ from the pop-up menu.\n\nFrom the appearing application list enable _External storage support_. \n\nThen click the round symbol again and open _settings_ .\n\nIn the settings panel on the left side, scroll to the Administration section add select: _External storages_ .\n\nOpen the _Add storage_ menu and select : _Amazon S3_\n\nThis opens a definition menu here you need to file following parameters: \n\n*   Folder name: display name for the allas bucket (2001234-nextcloud)\n*   Bucket: The bucket you just created  or some older bucket.\n*   Host:a3s.fi\n*   Port: 443\n*   Region: US\n*   Enable SSL\n*   Access key: from the output of the grep command above\n*   Secret key: from the output of the grep command above\n\nThen go to the _External storages_ in your _Personal_ settings and click the line containing \nthe external folder name just created to ensure that the storage works.\n\nIf you now move to the _Files_ tool in the main menu (blue bar on the top), \nyou should see an new external storage folder named as defined above.\n\nNow you can click this folder and start uploading and downloading data \nfrom and to this Allas bucket using the Nextcloud interface.\n\n## 4. Create new Nextcloud user account for an external user\n\nThe Nextcloud admin account can create new users and user groups to the Nextcloud server. \nClick the round symbol on the right end of the blue menu bar and select _Users_ from the pop-up menu.\n\nFirst we create a new user group by clicking _Add group_. Here we name the group as “users” \nand confirm the creation request by typing the password of Nextcloud admin.\n\nThen a new user is created by  clicking _add user_ \nUser name and password needs to be defined for the user and the \nnew account is added to group _Users_.\n\nFinally, we need to allow this new user to access the  _External storage_ (the bucket from Allas). \nTo do that, go back to the Settings view and reopen the _External storages_ settings from the Administration tools. \n\nNow in the “Available for” column, click the definition field. This lists the users and user groups. \nChoose either the user or user group to allow the new user to access the Allas bucket. You can define both \nread and write permissions or you can also give just read-only access to a user or user group. \nThese options are set with the menu that opens from the three dots next to the definition field.\n\n\n## 5. Using Nextcloud\n\nOnce a new next cloud account is created, you can send the account information to the new user and he/she will be able to use Nextcloud \nto upload and download data to the data bucket that was linked to the Nextcloud server. Note, that this \nuser doesn't need to have CSC account, a Nextcloud account is enough. I addition to the web interfaces, Nextcloud can be used by [desktop tools](https://nextcloud.com/install/) and [phone apps](https://apps.nextcloud.com/). \n\nComman line usage is possible too. This can be utilized for example in cases there data download or upload needs to be automatized. Below is a sample where data is uploaded and download using `curl` command and _application password_. In this case the NextCould admin has created a user named as _ncuser1_ for this purpose. First the _ncuser1_ logs is to the next cloud server. The user opens *Settings* menu and there moves to *Security* settings.\n\nIn security section section *Devices & Sessions*, an application password is created by clicking button: *Create a new app password*. Note that you have to copy and save the application password, that was just generated, as you can't check it later on. \n\nIn addition to user name and application password the user needs to know the IP address or server name to access the service. \nWith this information available, data can be downloaded from Nextcould using curl command syntax:\n```bash\ncurl -k -u username:app-password \"https://server-ip/remote.php/webdav/nextcloudirectiory/file-name\"\n```\n\nAnd upload can be done using syntax:\n```bash\ncurl -k -u username:app-password -T file-to-upload \"https://server-ip/remote.php/webdav/nextcloudirectiory/file-name\"\n```\n\nIn the commands above option `-k` is needed when the Nextcould server uses self signed certificates.\n\nIn this example the app password that user _ncuser1_  generated is: _Q34EN-Ni7pH-9oSes-ZQsF7-NdkYi_\nand the IP address of the NectCloud server is 123.456.768.910. Earlier the the Nextcloud admin had linked Allas bucket _2001234-nextcloud_\nto the next cloud service.\n\nNow the _ncuser1_ is able to upload a file _image1.jpg_ to Allas bucket _2001234-nextcloud_ with command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u ncuser1:Q34EN-Ni7pH-9oSes-ZQsF7-NdkYi -T ./image1.jpg \"https://123.456\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
