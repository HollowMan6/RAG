To do\nthis, you must enable either the *User packages* or the *Virtual environment* option under\n*Additional packages*, and provide the desired installation path before launching the session. These\noptions are shown after enabling the *Enable advanced settings* option at the end of the form.\n\nIf you do not define an installation path, the packages will be installed under\n`$HOME/.local/lib`. However, **this is not recommended** as the home directory\nstorage quota is limited.\n\n![Jupyter additional packages settings](../../img/ood_jupyter_additional_packages.png)\n\nTo install packages to the defined user packages directory, use the following command in the notebook:  \n\n```python\nimport sys \n!{sys.executable} -m pip install --user <package>\n```\n\nTo install packages to a virtual environment you can use the command:  \n`!{sys.executable} -m pip install <package>`\n\nIt is recommended to either use a virtual environment or set the Python user packages path to a directory under `/scratch` or `/projappl` when launching the app if you need to install packages.\n\n\n## Customizing the environment\nCustom Python environments can be created based on the Python modules or the system installed python.\nThe settings for customizing the Python environment are in the advanced settings in the app form.\n\nTo use a Python installation from a module that is not provided in the app form you can select\n*Custom module* and enter your own modules in the *Custom Python module* field in the form.\nIf the *Custom Python module* field is left blank, the system Python will be used. Note that this\nrequires using virtual environments.\n\n\n### Tykky installations\n\n\nTo use a Tykky installation with Jupyter, first [include Jupyter packages in your Tykky\ninstallation](../containers/tykky.md#using-jupyter-with-a-tykky-installation). Then, open the Puhti\nor Mahti web interface and navigate to the Jupyter app page. In the form, select the `Custom path`\noption from the Python dropdown. Then, enter the full path to the Python interpreter of your Tykky\ninstallation. So, if you created an installation with the command `conda-containerize new\n--prefix=/scratch/proj/myInst env.yml` then the path to enter would be\n`/scratch/proj/myInst/bin/python`.\n\n![Custom path selected in the menu](../../img/tykky_selection_jupyter.png)\n\n### Virtual environment\n\nYou can create a virtual environment by enabling the *Virtual environment* option in the app form,\nas seen in the [Installing packages section](#installing-packages), and providing desired path of\nyour virtual environment in the *Virtual environment path* field. The path should be under either\n`/scratch` or `/projappl`. For example, `/scratch/<project>/<username>/<venv>`.\n\nYou can also create the virtual environment with your terminal by navigating to either `/scratch` or `/projappl` folder and then creating the environment with a command:   \n`python -m venv --system-site-packages <venv>`      \nMake sure to load the module you are planning to use before creating the virtual environment.\n\nTo launch a created virtual environment later you need to select the same Python module and provide the same virtual environment path as when creating the environment. In Jupyter you can check the virtual environment you are currently using by running a command `!echo $VIRTUAL_ENV` in your notebook.\n\nTo install packages in your virtual environment you can run the command `!{sys.executable} -m pip install <package>` in your Jupyter notebook.\nThe virtual environments are currently not completely isolated as they use packages from the loaded modules.\n\n\n\n### Useful Jupyter commands\nRemember to run `import sys` first.\n\n| Functionality    | Command |\n| -------- | ------- |\n| Install package to user directory  | `!{sys.executable} -m pip install --user <package>`    |\n| Install package to virtual environment | `!{sys.executable} -m pip install <package>`     |\n| Check current venv    | `!echo $VIRTUAL_ENV`    |\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
