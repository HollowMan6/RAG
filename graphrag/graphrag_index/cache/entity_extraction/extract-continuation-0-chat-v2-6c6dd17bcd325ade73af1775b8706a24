Select\n'Boot from volume snapshot (creates a new volume)' (**2**) as the boot\nsource for the instance and to 'Volume Snapshot' select\nfrom the list of snapshots (**3**) the one you wish to launch.\n\n![Launch a volume snapshot based instance.](../img/cloud_pouta_vm_snapshot_7.svg)\n\nLaunching a server image from a volume snapshot using the CLI \nis a slightly longer process and is not covered in \nthis article. However, if you are interested, you can find more\ninformation in the official OpenStack [documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/user-guide/cli-nova-launch-instance-from-volume.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n#### Downloading a volume snapshot\n\nIt is not possible to download a volume snapshot directly from OpenStack, not from the web interface neither from the CLI. But it is possible to indirectly download the contents of a snapshot. The basic idea is to create a volume from the volume snapshot, and then mount said new volume into a VM. Once that is done, it will be possible to download individual files or the whole volume in a single file.\n\n1. Create the volume from the snapshot:\n\n    ![Create volume](../img/cloud_pouta_vm_snapshot_8.svg)\n\n    ![Create volume](../img/cloud_pouta_vm_snapshot_9.svg)\n\n    Set the `Volume Name` to something that clearly identifies the volume as a snapshot, as when the process is over, you will need to delete this volume.\n    !!! Info \"Using the CLI\"\n        `openstack volume create --snapshot b4f95381-e56d-4080-95e4-935c66528005 test-snapshot`\n\n        The id `b4f95381-e56d-4080-95e4-935c66528005` corresponds to the snapshot we want to restore, and `test-snapshot` is the name of the new createc volume.\n\n1. Now you need to attach the volume to a VM. You can use an existing VM or [create a new VM](../launch-vm-from-web-gui/). Once you have a VM ready, you need to attach the volume to it:\n\n    ![Manage Attachments](../img/cloud_pouta_vm_snapshot_10.svg)\n\n    ![Manage Volume Attachments](../img/cloud_pouta_vm_snapshot_11.svg)\n\n    !!! Info \"Using the CLI\"\n        `openstack server add volume salto 1a0c583d-1981-4246-9b7f-23865c1884c1`\n\n         `salto` is the name of the VM, the id corresponds to the volume newly created.\n\n1. Once attached, you need to mount the volume into a folder of the VM. First, you need to know the device name. The information is under the `Attached To` field in the Volumes table.\n\n     ![Attached To](../img/attached_to.png)\n\n1. [Log in the VM via SSH](../connecting-to-vm/) and mount the folder:\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo mount /dev/vdb /mnt\n    ```\n\n    In the case above, the device is `/dev/vdb`, and the folder `/mnt`.\n\n1. Once mounted, you can use `scp` or `rsync` to get individual files in a folder:\n\n    ```sh\n    scp salto:/mnt/important-file .\n    ```\n\n    In this case we are using `scp`, with the host name `salto` and the file we are retrieving `important-file`. On the other hand, if you want to get all the files in a compressed `tar` file, you can run something like:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ ssh salto \"sudo tar czf - /mnt/\" > file.tar.gz\n    ```\n\n1. After you get the files you needed to get, you need to clean up:\n\n    * Unmount the volume `umount /mnt`.\n    * Detach the volume from the VM.\n    * Remove the volume you created in step 1.\n\n## General considerations\n\nWe recommend powering off the instance and detaching volumes\nbefore taking snapshots. This is the best way to make sure\nthe file system is captured in a consistent state.\n\nPlease note that snapshots may not always be the optimal method of\ngetting an instance into a predefined state.
