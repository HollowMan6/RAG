ArcGIS Online is available for consortium members - each university may have up to 5000 users and use 50 000 [ArcGIS\nOnline -credits](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline/credits) per year. For joining ArcGIS Online ask your University's ArcGIS contact person.\n\nGuidelines for the ArcGIS Online administrators:\n\n- [Invite and add members](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/invite-users.htm)\n- [Granting ArcGIS licenses in ArcGIS Online](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/manage-licenses.htm)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Virtual Campus \n\nVirtual Campus includes a wide selection of Internet courses about GIS,\nthe focus is on ESRI tools and technology. A lot of Virtual Campus\ncourses are free, in addition consortium members have access to all\ncourses of types Web Course or Training seminar.\n\n-   [The full list of Virtual campus courses](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/search/)\n\nFor participating in a Virtual Campus course you need an ESRI Global\nAccount. For courses with a fee, you also need to be added to consortium's ArcGIS accont, ask\nfor it from CSC.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Performance tips for ArcGIS desktop software \n\n* ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro both have several functions that can run in parallel and especially in ArcGIS Pro the situation is improving constantly, so check the online documentation for up-to-date situation with specific tools. For activating the parallel processing set [Parallel processing factor](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/environment-settings/parallel-processing-factor.htm) in your environment settings or used tool's setting correctly.\n* For best performance with ArcMap enable [64-bit-background Geoprocessing](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/analyze/executing-tools/64bit-background.htm). \n* Using the `memory / in_memory` workspace instead of using geometry objects is faster, but if you need memory also for calculation and have a big dataset loaded, there might not be enough memory available. Help: [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/basics/the-in-memory-workspace.htm) / [ArcGIS desktop](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/analyze/modelbuilder/the-in-memory-workspace.htm).\n* Use ArcPy scripts where the parallelization is added with Python, for example Multiprocessing or Parallel packages.\n   - [Arcpy multiprocessing examples](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog489/node/2261)\n   - [Parallel Python: Multiprocessing With ArcPy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAzCG6C8-7g), [examples](https://github.com/nRajasekar92/DevSummit-2017)\n   - [Blog: Using Arcpy with multiprocessing](https://pythongisandstuff.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/using-arcpy-with-multiprocessing-part-3/)\n   - [Example: Producing Building Shadows](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/19935/port-producing-building-shadows-avenue-code-to-arcgis-10/20352#20352)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n## ArcGIS in CSC's computing environment\n\n*   ArcGIS desktop tools ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap are available only for Windows operating system, which makes installing them impossible in CSC's supercomputers and very difficult in cPouta cloud, which has limited support for Windows.\n*   ESRI provides [a wide range of server products](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/get-started/windows/about-arcgis-server-licensing-roles.htm) for large scale spatial data analysis. These ArcGIS server products usually support Linux operating system and can be installed to cPouta.\n*   For running [ArcPy scripts](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) in CSC computing environment, the best option is to install ArcGIS Server with ArcPy to cPouta. ArcGIS Server ArcPy might be slightly different than ArcGIS desktop ArcPy. The installation instructions can be found from [GitHub](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/pouta/arcpy).\n*   [ArcGIS Python API](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) is available in Puhti as module `arcgis-python-api`. The module is based on [ESRI's arcgis_learn metapackage](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/deep-learning) and includes also packages for deep learning. See [ESRI's ArcGIS Python API samples](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/samples/) for ideas and code examples. Some parts of ArcGIS Python API require logging in to your home organization's ArcGIS Online. ArcGIS Python API was installed on Puhti using [Tykky's conda-containerize functionality](../computing/containers/tykky.md), using this [ArcGIS Python API conda environment file](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/supercomputer_installations/arcgis-python-api-2.1.0.yml).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Contact \n\n-   Each university\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
