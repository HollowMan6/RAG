Orterun does not know of the Slurm\nflags, so it needs to be told how many tasks/threads to use. The following\nexample will run a [GROMACS](../../apps/gromacs.md) mean square displacement\nanalysis for an existing trajectory:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project>\nmodule load gromacs-env\norterun -n 1 gmx_mpi msd -n index.ndx -f traj.xtc -s topol.tpr\n```\n\nTo use all requested cores in parallel, you need to add `--oversubscribe`.\nE.g. for 4 cores, a parallel interactive job\n(launched *from* the interactive session) can be run with:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project> --cores 4\nmodule load gromacs-env\norterun -n 4 --oversubscribe gmx_mpi mdrun -s topol.tpr\n```\n\n## Explicit interactive shell without X11 graphics\n\nIf you do not want to use the `sinteractive` wrapper, it is also possible to\nuse Slurm commands explicitly to launch an interactive session. Since you may\nneed to queue, it is recommended to ask for an email notification once the\nresources have been granted.\n\n```bash\nsrun --ntasks=1 --time=00:10:00 --mem=1G --pty \\\n     --account=<project> --partition=small --mail-type=BEGIN \\\n     bash\n```\n\nOnce the resources are available, you can work normally in the shell. The\nBash prompt shows the name of the compute node:\n\n```bash\n[username@r07c02 ~]$\n```\n\nOnce the requested time has passed, the shell exits automatically.\n\n## Starting an interactive application with X11 graphics\n\nTo enable X11 graphics, add `--x11=first` to the command.\nThe following will start the application `myprog`:\n\n```bash\nsrun --ntasks=1 --time=00:10:00 --mem=1G --x11=first --pty \\\n     --account=<project> --partition=small --mail-type=BEGIN \\\n     myprog\n```\n\nNote that you can replace `myprog` with `bash`, which will launch a shell\non the compute node, which you can, in turn, use to launch graphical\napplications. Once the requested time has passed, the application is\nterminated automatically.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
