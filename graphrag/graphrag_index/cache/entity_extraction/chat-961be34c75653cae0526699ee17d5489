Warning \"DeploymentConfig is deprecated\"\n    DeploymentConfig is deprecated in newer versions of OpenShift OKD and will be completely removed in the future. See Redhat's [deprecation announcement of DeploymentConfig](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7041372) and their [replacement guide for DeploymentConfig](https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:replace-deprecated-deploymentconfigs-deployments/resource/resources:convert-deploymentconfig-deployment).\n\nDeploymentConfigs are objects that create\n[ReplicationControllers](../tutorials/elemental_tutorial.md#replicationcontroller) according to\n`spec.template`. They differ from ReplicationControllers in the sense that\nDeploymentConfig objects may start new ReplicationControllers based on the state of\n`spec.triggers`. In the example below, the DeploymentConfig performs\nan automatic rolling update when it gets triggered by an ImageStream named\n`serveimagestream:latest`. For other update strategies, see \"[Deployment\nStrategies](https://docs.okd.io/3.11/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html)\"\nin the OpenShift documentation.\n\nDeploymentConfig objects function similarly to deployments described in the\nchapter [concepts](concepts.md) except that deployments\ntrigger updates only when `spec.template` is changed. Furthermore, deployment\nis a pure Kubernetes concept, and DeploymentConfig is an OpenShift extension.\n\nRecall that [ReplicationControllers](../tutorials/elemental_tutorial.md#replicationcontroller)\nare objects that make sure that a requested number of replicas of the pod defined in the\n`spec.template` is running.\n\n*`deploymentconfig.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: DeploymentConfig\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n  name: blogdeployment\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    app: serveapp\n    deploymentconfig: blogdeployment\n  strategy:\n    activeDeadlineSeconds: 21600\n    type: Rolling\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: serveapp\n        deploymentconfig: blogdeployment\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: serve-cont\n        image: \"serveimagestream:latest\"\n  triggers:\n  - type: ConfigChange\n  - imageChangeParams:\n      automatic: true\n      containerNames:\n      - serve-cont\n      from:\n        name: serveimagestream:latest\n    type: ImageChange\n```\n\nIn this case, the DeploymentConfig object listens to the *ImageStream* object\n`serveimagestream:latest`.\n\n### ImageStream\n\nImageStreams simplify image names and get triggered by a BuildConfig if new\nimages are uploaded to the registry. When a new image is\nuploaded, it can trigger its listeners to act. In the case of our\nDeployment, the action triggered would be to do an update for the pods\nthat it is meant to deploy.\n\nA simple ImageStream object:\n\n*`imagestream.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1\nkind: ImageStream\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n  name: serveimagestream\nspec:\n  lookupPolicy:\n    local: false\n```\n\n### BuildConfig\n\nBuildConfig objects create container images according to specific rules. In\nthe following example, the _Docker_ strategy is used to build a trivial extension\nof the `httpd` image shipped with OpenShift.\n\n*`buildconfig.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\nkind: \"BuildConfig\"\napiVersion: \"v1\"\nmetadata:\n  name: \"serveimg-generate\"\n  labels:\n    app: \"serveapp\"\nspec:\n  runPolicy: \"Serial\"\n  output:\n    to:\n      kind: ImageStreamTag\n      name: serveimagestream:latest\n  source:\n    dockerfile: |\n      FROM docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd\n  strategy:\n    type: Docker\n```\n\nAfter creating the build object (here named `serveimg-generate`\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
