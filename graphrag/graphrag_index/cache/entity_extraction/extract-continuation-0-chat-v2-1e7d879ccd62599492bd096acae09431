Please familiarize yourself with the areas and their specific\npurposes. The disk areas for different supercomputers are separate, *i.e.* **home**,\n**projappl** and **scratch** in Puhti cannot be directly accessed from Mahti. Also\n[a more technical description of the Lustre filesystem](lustre.md) used in these directories\nis available.\n\n!!! warning \"CSC does not backup your data!\"\n    None of the disk areas are automatically backed up by CSC! This means that data accidentally\n    deleted by the user cannot be recovered in any way. To avoid unintended data loss, make sure\n    to perform regular backups to, for example, [Allas](../data/Allas/index.md). See also the\n    [allas-backup tool](../data/Allas/using_allas/a_backup.md).\n\n|            |Owner   |Environment variable|Path                 |Cleaning                 |Automatic backup|\n|------------|--------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n|**home**    |Personal|`${HOME}`           |`/users/<user-name>` |No                       |No              |\n|**projappl**|Project |Not available       |`/projappl/<project>`|No                       |No              |\n|**scratch** |Project |Not available       |`/scratch/<project>` |180 days on Puhti        |No              |\n\nThese disk areas have quotas for both the amount of data and total number of files:\n\n|            |Capacity|Number of files|\n|------------|--------|---------------|\n|**home**    |10 GiB  |100 000 files  |\n|**projappl**|50 GiB  |100 000 files  |\n|**scratch** |1 TiB   |1 000 000 files|\n\n!!! info \"LUE\"\n    To easily check the amount of data and number of files within a given folder on\n    the parallel file system, please consider using the [LUE](../support/tutorials/lue.md)\n    tool. This tool is significantly faster than tools like `stat` or `du` and causes\n    much less load on the file system.\n\n!!! info \"Quotas and cleaning\"\n    While it is possible to [apply for increased quotas](#increasing-quotas), we\n    recommend that you always first ensure that the data you have stored on the\n    shared file system is really needed and in active use. Unused data should be\n    moved to e.g. [Allas](../data/Allas/index.md). A general tutorial on [managing\n    and cleaning data on Puhti and Mahti disks](../support/tutorials/clean-up-data.md)\n    is also available.\n\n## Home directory\n\nEach user has a home directory (`$HOME`) that can contain up to 10 GB of data.\n\nThe home directory is the default directory where you begin after logging in to CSC supercomputers.\nHowever, typically you should change to your project's `scratch` directory when working because\nthe **home directory is not intended for data analysis or computing**. Its purpose is to store\nconfiguration files and other minor personal data. A home directory exceeding its capacity\ncauses various account problems.\n\nThe home directory is the only user-specific directory in supercomputers. All other directories\nare project-specific. If you are a member of several projects, you also have access to several\n`scratch` or `projappl` directories, but still have only one home directory.\n\n## Scratch directory\n\nEach project has by default 1 TB of scratch disk space in the directory `/scratch/<project>`.\n\n\nThis fast parallel scratch space is intended as temporary storage\nspace for the data that is used in the supercomputer. The scratch\ndirectory is not intended for long-term data storage. To ensure that\nthe disks do not fill up CSC will regularly delete files that have not\nbeen accessed in a long time. In Puhti the current policy is to remove\nfiles that have not been accessed for more than 6 months. In Mahti a\nsimilar cleaning procedure will be introduced, but is not yet\nactive. See [Usage policy](../../computing/usage-policy) page for details on the current\npolicy.\n\n\nMake sure to consult our tutorial for [tips and guidelines on how to\nmanage your data on `scratch`](../support/tutorials/clean-up-data.md).\n\n\n\n## Projappl directory\n\nEach project has also a 50 GB project application disk space in the directory\n`/projappl/<project>`.\n\nIt is intended for storing applications you have compiled yourself, libraries etc. that you\nare sharing within the project. It is not a personal storage space but it is shared with\nall members of the project team. Note that no files in this folder will be removed automatically.\n\nIt is not intended for running applications, so please run them in `scratch` instead.\n\n## Using scratch and projappl directories\n\nAn overview of your directories in the supercomputer you are currently logged on can be\ndisplayed with:\n\n```bash\ncsc-workspaces \n```\n\nThe above command displays all `scratch` and `projappl` directories you have access to.\n\nFor example, if you are a member in two projects, with unix groups `project_2012345`\nand `project_3587167`, then you have access to two `scratch` and `projappl` directories:\n\n```text\n[kkayttaj@puhti ~]$ csc-workspaces \nDisk area\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides supercomputing resources including disk areas such as home, projappl, and scratch, without automatic backup)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A personal disk area on CSC supercomputers with a quota of 10 GiB and 100,000 files, not intended for data analysis or computing)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJAPPL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project disk area on CSC supercomputers for storing applications and libraries shared within a project, with a 50 GiB and 100,000 files quota)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCRATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A temporary storage space on CSC supercomputers for data used in computing, with a 1 TiB and 1,000,000 files quota, subject to cleaning policies)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A CSC supercomputer with specific disk areas and cleaning policies for scratch directories)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>A CSC supercomputer with specific disk areas, intended to have similar cleaning policies for scratch directories as Puhti)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE FILESYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The filesystem used in CSC supercomputers' directories, offering technical specifications for data management)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage service recommended by CSC for regular backups, as CSC does not provide automatic backups for data)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool provided by CSC for checking the amount of data and number of files within a given folder on the parallel file system)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOME<|>CSC<|>The HOME directory is a personal disk area provided by CSC on its supercomputers<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJAPPL<|>CSC<|>The PROJAPPL directory is a project disk area provided by CSC for storing shared applications and libraries<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCRATCH<|>CSC<|>The SCRATCH directory is provided by CSC as a temporary storage space for data used in computing<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>SCRATCH<|>Puhti has a specific cleaning policy for its SCRATCH directories, managed by CSC<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>SCRATCH<|>Mahti is intended to have similar cleaning policies for SCRATCH directories as Puhti, managed by CSC<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE FILESYSTEM<|>CSC<|>The Lustre filesystem is used in CSC supercomputers' directories for data management<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC<|>Allas is recommended by CSC for backups due to the lack of automatic data backup on CSC supercomputers<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUE<|>CSC<|>LUE is a tool provided by CSC for efficient data and file count checks on the parallel file system<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
