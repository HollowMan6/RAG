Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Because of that, \nmost of the tools are not effective for raw NGS datasets where you have millions of sequences (reads).\nExamples of application areas of EMBOSS tools are given below.\n\n* Sequence alignment\n* Phylogeny\n* Hidden Markow models\n* Rapid database searching with sequence patterns\n* Protein motif identification, including domain analysis\n* EST analysis\n* Nucleotide sequence pattern analysis, for example to identify CpG islands.\n* Simple and species-specific repeat identification\n* Codon usage analysis for small genomes\n* Rapid identification of sequence patterns in large scale sequence sets.\n* Presentation tools for publication\n* RNA secondary structure prediction\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [GNU GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 6.5.7\n- [Chipster](https://chipster.csc.fi) provides a graphical interface to many EMBOSS tools.\n\n## Usage\n\nEMBOSS programs are available on Puhti as part of the collection in biokit module. To use it, load the biokit module by running the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nThe biokit module sets up a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools, including EMBOSS.\nNote however that there are other bioinformatics tools on Puhti that have separate setup commands.\n\nAfter loading biokit, you can start any of the EMBOSS programs by typing its name. For example:\n\n```bash\nwossname\n```\n\nThe `wossname` command is a help tool that you can use to see what EMBOSS commands are available. You can also use it to search EMBOSS tools using keywords.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Homepage of EMBOSS project](http://emboss.open-bio.org/)\n* [EMBOSS programs sorted alphabetically](https://extras.csc.fi/emboss/doc/programs/html/index.html)\n* [EMBOSS programs sorted by function](https://extras.csc.fi/emboss/doc/programs/html/groups.html)\n* [EMBOSS Quick Guide](https://extras.csc.fi/emboss/emboss_qg.pdf)\n* [Getting started with EMBOSS -tutorial](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/emboss_tutorial/emboss_tutorial.html)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
