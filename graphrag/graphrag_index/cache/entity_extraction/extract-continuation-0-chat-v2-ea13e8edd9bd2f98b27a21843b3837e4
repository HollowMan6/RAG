It is currently available in preview.\n\n[**CDSE**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse) provides also processing services, mainly via [**OpenEO**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/apis/openeo-api) and [**SentinelHub**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/apis/sentinel-hub) with options to bring processing close to the data. Both have free of charge options and services with a fee. They provide different APIs, which can be accessed via Python or R. Soon also On-Demand Processing.\n\n* [Copernicus Data Workspace](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/workspace/) is a tool for managing and reviewing EO-related products, which can then be further processed or downloaded for various purposes. When products are selected for processing, you are provided with a list of processors that are capable of processing relevant data types.\n* [CDSE Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyterhub.dataspace.copernicus.eu/) provide the ability to analyze the data using Jupyter Notebooks. Each user has 10Gb of persistent space (deleted after 15 days without login) and access to 2 - 4 CPUs with 4 - 16 Gb RAM. Note that in addition to personal limits, also the total number of active users seems to be limited. It is possible to add own packages via pip. [CDSE example notebooks](https://github.com/eu-cdse/notebook-samples)\n* And many more, see [all CDSE applications](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Applications.html)\n \n**Commercial clouds**: Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, all provide virtual machines and other processing services, all of them have some local data, see links above. \n \n## Where can I get help?\n\nIf you are interested in using CSC services for your EO research, please make yourself familiar with the services:\n\n* Visit a course, seminar or workshop; you can find all upcoming and past events in [the CSC training calendar](https://www.csc.fi/en/trainings/training-calendar)\n    * For getting started, go through [CSC Computing Environment - Self Learning course](https://ssl.eventilla.com/csccompenvselflearn)\n* Find information about services and how to use them in [CSC's documentation pages](../../../index.md)\n* For information on geocomputing in CSC environment, checkout the collection of  [CSC's geocomputing learning materials](https://research.csc.fi/gis-learning-materials) and [CSC geocomputing examples on Github](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing)\n\nYou can find all the ways that you can get help from CSC specialists via [CSC contact page](../../contact.md). We are happy to help with technical problems around our services and are open for suggestions on which software should be installed to Puhti, or what kind of courses should be offered or materials/examples should be prepared. Please let us know, if you would like to add a service to this page or find anything unclear.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis guide was developed in cooperation with the [Finnish Environment Institute, SYKE](https://www.syke.fi/), as part of the [Geoportti project](https://www.geoportti.fi/).\n\n## Contributions welcome\n\nIf you find any mistakes or outdated links, have improvement suggestions or want to add more information about a certain topic, please add them to our [Github issue for improving the EO guide](https://github.com/CSCfi/csc-user-guide/issues/1549), send a pull request to our [CSC documentation on github](https://github.com/CSCfi/csc-user-guide/) or contact us via any of the ways mentioned in [CSC contact page](../../contact.md).
