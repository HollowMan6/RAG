On [LUMI you need to use `srun` to log in to a node where you have a running job](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/interactive/#using-srun-to-check-running-jobs):\n\n```bash\nsrun --interactive --pty --jobid=<jobid> rocm-smi\n```\n\nReplace `<jobid>` with the actual Slurm job ID. You can also use\n`watch rocm-smi` to get the continually updated view.\n\n   \n### Using multiple CPUs for data pre-processing\n\nOne common reason for the GPU utilization being low is when the CPU\ncannot load and pre-process the data fast enough, and the GPU has to\nwait for the next batch to process. It is then a common practice to\nreserve more CPUs to perform data loading and pre-processing in\nseveral parallel threads or processes. A good rule of thumb in Puhti\nis to **reserve 10 CPUs per GPU** (as there are 4 GPUs and 40 CPUs on\neach node). On Mahti you can reserve up to 32 cores, as that\ncorresponds to 1/4 of the node. On LUMI we recommend using 7 CPU\ncores, as there are 63 cores for 8 GPUs. **Remember that CPUs are a\nmuch cheaper resource than the GPU!**\n\nYou might have noticed that we have already followed this advice in our example\njob scripts:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10\n```\n\nYour code also has to support parallel pre-processing. However, most high-level\nmachine learning frameworks support this out of the box. For example in\n[TensorFlow you can use `tf.data`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data) and\nset `num_parallel_calls` to the number of CPUs reserved and utilize `prefetch`:\n\n```python\ndataset = dataset.map(..., num_parallel_calls=10)\ndataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size)\n```\n\nIn [PyTorch, you can use\n`torch.utils.DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html), which\nsupports data loading with multiple processes:\n\n```python\ntrain_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(..., num_workers=10)\n```\n\nIf you are using multiple data loaders, but data loading is still slow, it is\nalso possible that you are using the shared file system inefficiently. A common\nerror is to read a huge number of small files. You can read more about [how to\nstore and load data in the most efficient way for machine learning in our\nseparate tutorial](ml-data.md).\n\n### Profilers\n\n[TensorFlow Profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) and\n[PyTorch\nProfiler](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_profiler_tutorial.html)\nare available as TensorBoard plugins. The profilers can be found at\nthe *PROFILE* and *PYTORCH_PROFILER* tabs in TensorBoard,\nrespectively. Note that the tabs may not be visible by default but can\nbe found at the pull-down menu on the right-hand side of the\ninterface.  The profilers can be used to identify resource consumption\nand to resolve performance bottlenecks, in particular the data input\npipeline.\n\nSee also:\n\n- [How to launch TensorBoard using the Puhti web interface](../../computing/webinterface/apps.md)\n- [PyTorch profiler tutorial](../../apps/pytorch.md#pytorch-profiler)\n\n## GPU energy usage\n\nFor ecological and economical reasons it is often needed to monitor\nthe energy usage of machine learning jobs. Measuring the full energy\nusage of a single job, including CPU and GPU processing, networking\nand cooling is quite difficult to do in the general case as those\nresources are shared over many jobs and can depend on various factors\nindependent of the monitored job. Fortunately, measuring the energy\nusage of just the GPUs is easier, as they are typically not shared\namong many jobs. As the GPU is by far the biggest energy user it\nprovides a good approximation of the total energy usage.\n\n### Tools for monitoring GPU energy usage\n\n#### `seff` command for a completed job (Puhti and Mahti)\n\nOn Puhti and Mahti you can use the `seff` tool for a completed job:\n\n```bash\nseff <job_id>\n```\n\nNote that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
