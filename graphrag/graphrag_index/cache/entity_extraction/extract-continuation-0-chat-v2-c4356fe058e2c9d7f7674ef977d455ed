Due to this the capability to reset the ssh settings has been removed. \n\n## Usage\n\n\n### Help \n\n`csc-env help` will show all the available commands and options.\n\n### Test\n\n`csc-env test` will check for common issues in the user environment by comparing \nthem to the default settings. The test result can be included in your support request to the servicedesk. \nBelow is an example test output: \n\n```\ncsc_user@puhti $ csc-env test\n\nInfo\n---------------------\nUser: csc_user\nHost: puhti-login11\nHome: /users/csc_user\nHome quota\n    capacity: 23%\n    files:    15%\nDefault shell: /bin/bash \n\n\n\nEnvironment test\n---------------------\nPATH is modified NOTE\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH has default value OK\nLD_PRELOAD has default value OK\nPYTHONPATH has default value OK\nMODULEPATH has default value OK\nMODULEPATH_ROOT has default value OK\nTMPDIR has default value OK\nCDPATH has default value OK\nCommand alias output differs NOTE\nCommand module list has default output OK\n$HOME permission is 0700: OK\nSSH folder permission is 0700: OK\n\n\n\nFile diff test\n---------------------\n/users/csc_user/.bashrc is modified NOTE\n/users/csc_user/.bash_profile same as default OK\n/users/csc_user/.bash_logout same as default OK\n```\n\n`OK` indicates that the test matches the default and `FAILED` indicates that there is an incorrect setting.\n`NOTE` does not indicate an error, just that the setting has been changed and might explain some issues.\n\n### Basic usage\n\nHere we present the basic reset + restore cycle.\n\n`csc-env reset` will ask you what settings you want to reset, save the settings, and reset them to system defaults.\nWhen the program prompts for input, press the number corresponding to your selection and then press enter. \n\n```\ncsc_user@puhti $ csc-env reset\n[ INFO ] reset requires a target, please select one: \n1) login\n2) shell\n#? 1\n[ INFO ] Files ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bash_logout have been saved to \n         /users/csc_user/.csc/csc_env_saves/login_auto/2021-01-18T14:42:44_reset_csc14 \n[ INFO ] Resetting ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bash_logout \nConfirm\n1) Yes\n2) No\n#? 1\n[ INFO ] Reset completed\n```\n\nWhen you want to restore the settings, use the command `csc-env restore`. This will ask you what settings you want to restore, save the current settings, and\nthen restore the settings saved during the previous reset. \n\n```\ncsc_user@puhti $ csc-env restore\n[ INFO ] restore requires a target, please select one: \n1) login\n2) shell\n#? 1\n[ INFO ] Files ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bash_logout have been saved to\n         /users/csc_user/.csc/csc_env_saves/login_auto/2021-01-18T14:47:59_restore_csc15 \n[ INFO ] Restoring .bashrc .bash_profile and .bash_logout from \n         /users/csc_user/.csc/csc_env_saves/login_auto/2021-01-18T14:42:44_reset_csc14 \nConfirm\n1) Yes\n2) No\n#? 1\n[ INFO ] Restore was completed\n```\n\nIf you accidentally do `csc-env reset` twice in a row, do not panic, your files are not lost.\nSee the next chapter for information on how to recover them. \n\n### Advanced usage\n\n#### Running commands in a clean environment\n\nUsing the command `csc-env run-base` the user can be dropped into a\nnew shell where no user modifications are present. This is useful for testing and debugging\nwithout changes to any files. Running a command in a clean environment can be done with\n`csc-env run-base -- -c \"command args\"`\n\nNote that clean here means the default login settings (so default modules will be loaded)\n\n#### Manually creating and selecting saves \n\nEach invocation of `csc-env reset` or `csc-env restore` automatically saves the current selected settings. \nThe command `csc-env list-saved` will list all saves:\n\n```\ncsc_user@puhti $ csc-env list-saved\nAvailable restores in /users/csc_user/.c\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>`csc-env` is a command line tool used on CSC supercomputers for testing common issues in the programming environment and resetting login settings in a non-destructive manner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGIN-SETTINGS<|>EVENT<|>Refers to the files `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, and `.bash_logout` in the user's home directory, which can be reset to system defaults by `csc-env`)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPPORT STAFF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC support staff assists users with issues related to login-settings and other technical problems on CSC supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH CONNECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>As of the RHEL8 update, ssh connections between nodes within CSC supercomputers use host based authentication, removing the need to reset ssh settings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is one of the CSC supercomputers where `csc-env` command is utilized)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>LOGIN-SETTINGS<|>`csc-env` tool is used for resetting login-settings on CSC supercomputers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPPORT STAFF<|>LOGIN-SETTINGS<|>CSC support staff cannot see users' login-settings, making `csc-env` tool essential for troubleshooting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH CONNECTIONS<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>SSH connections update on CSC supercomputers led to changes in `csc-env` functionality<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>Puhti is a part of the CSC supercomputers network where `csc-env` is used<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
