See the [Contact page](/support/contact/) for instructions. Quota requests are\nhandled on a case-by-case basis depending on the currently available resources\nin Rahti 1 and the use case.\n\n## Sharing projects with other users\n\nOpenShift has a flexible role-based access control system that allows you to\ngive access to projects you have created to other users and groups in the system.\nYou can give e.g. full admin, basic user, edit or read only access to other\nusers and groups in the system for collaboration.\n\nYou can edit project memberships in the web interface via Resources ->\nMembership. You can either give access rights to individual users or groups by\nselecting either the _Users_ or _Groups_ tab and clicking _Edit Membership_ in the\ntop right corner.\n\nNote that it is important to use correct usernames when sharing projects\nwith others. OpenShift allows you to freely enter any username and will not notify\nyou for having entered a non-existent username. Usernames are also case-sensitive.\nYou can find out your username in OpenShift via either the\nweb interface or the command line:\n\n1. In the web interface, click the question mark symbol in the top bar and\n   select \"Command Line Tools\". You can find your username above the text box\n   that has the login command.\n2. If you have an active command line session, you can use the command `oc whoami`.\n\nHere is a table that summarize the main different roles:  \n\n| Roles        | Description \n|--------------|-------------\n| admin        | A project manager. An admin has rights to view and modify any resource in the project. (Except for quota).\n| basic-user   | A user that can get basic information about projects and users.\n| edit         | A user that can modify most objects in a project but does not have the power to view or modify roles or bindings.\n| view         | A user who cannot make any modifications, but can see most objects in a project. They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.\n\nIf you want a user to have minimum view on a project, select **view** role. **Basic user** won't be enough to see a project details.   \n\nIf you would like to share a project you have created with members of the same CSC\ncomputing project, you can do so by selecting the _Groups_ tab, clicking _Edit\nMembership_, and entering the name of the computing project and a role in the\ndropdown menu on the right for the members of that computing project.\n\n## Deleting a Rahti 1 project\n\nIn order to delete a Rahti 1 project, you need to go to the main landing page and click in the 3 vertical dots next to the name of the project. In the drop down menu, you will see the option \"Delete Project\".\n\n![Remove Rahti 1 drop down](../../img/delete_project_menu.png)\n\nBefore the Rahti 1 project is removed, you will be asked to input the name of the project to confirm that you really want to remove the Rahti 1 project and prevent accidents.\n\n!!! warning\n    After the project has been confirmed for deletion, all resources will be deleted and there will be no way to restore them, including the data stored in the persistent volumes.\n\n![Project name dialog](../../img/delete_project_name.png)\n\nAfter that, Rahti 1 will start to delete all the resources of the project. It could take only few seconds or up to a minute, it depends of amount of resources the project had. After that Rahti 1 will liberate the project name, and it will be possible to create an empty project with the same name.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
