High-performance computing environment like Puhti is a suitable place for running compute-intensive jobs using MaxQuant software in proteomics research.\n\nMaxQuant is free to use, but each user needs to register and download MaxQuant from the [developer site](https://maxquant.org/download_asset/maxquant/latest) themselves.\n\nThis tutorial provides instructions for running MaxQuant software on Puhti.\n\n## Configure parameter file\n\nEven if you are going to run the MaxQuant pipeline on Puhti, \nyou first have to configure different parameters of your MaxQuant \njob on your local Windows machine. And then upload parameter file \n(i.e.,`mqpar.xml`), raw data samples (i.e, .raw files) and sequence \nfile (i.e., .fasta file) to Puhti computing environment.\n\n## Edit XML configuration file\n\nYou have to make some modifications in parameter file (`mqpar.xml`), which was for example created on a local windows machine, to comply with HPC environment.\n\nThese modifications include changes in :\n\n- Windows paths into linux paths for sample files ( tip: search for `<filePaths>` in XML file) \n- Windows path into linux path for fasta sequence file  (tip: search for `<fastaFilePath>` in XML file)\n- In the number of threads according to number of samples (tip: search for  `<numThreads>` in XML file)\n\n## Submit as a batch job to Puhti cluster\n\n- First login to Puhti computer (see instructions [here](../../computing/connecting/index.md))\n\n- Change to your project directory on Puhti and copy your input files there ([tips on how to transfer files](../../data/moving/index.md)).\n\n This is your project directory (on scratch) where your .xml files, .fasta file, and raw data files are located\n\n- Learn how to enable MaxQuant environment \n\nMaxQuant software actually also needs mono software to be able to run. \nWith mono software, you can choose your *version* of MaxQuant. \nCSC provides a module for mono.\n\n```text\nmodule load mono/5.14\n```\n\nDownload your linux-compatible version of MaxQuant (e.g., v2.0.3.0) to your \nscratch directory on Puhti and run the following to verify that MaxQuant is installed properly:\n\n```text\nmono MaxQuant\\ 2.0.3.0/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe --help\n```\n\nNote that the directory name contains a space, so you need to either escape it using backslash (\\) or enclose the path in quotes. For ease of use, you may wish to rename the directory so it has e.g underscore instead of space. \n\n!!! Note \n    Please note that the MaxQuant version you used to create .xml parameter \n    configuration file must match with the version you use on linux environment \n    to smoothly run it on a cluster environment. Other latest versions may work.\n\n\n - Finally submit your script\n\nCreate a batch script according to the [instructions for shared memory jobs](../../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti#serial-and-shared-memory-batch-jobs) \nand make sure the script ends up in the same directory as your `mqpar.xml` \nfile and other data files are located.\n\nJust to facilitate writing your batch scripting process, you may use the following  \nminimal example script (calles say, e.g., `maxquant.sh`), to start with: \n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=maxquant\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --account=project_xxx\n#SBATCH --time=01:20:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6\n#SBATCH --mem=16000\n\n# load maxquant environment\n\nmodule load mono/5.14\n\n# adjust file paths here\n\nmono /path_of_MaxQuant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe /path/MaxQuant/mqpar.xml\n\n```\n\nand then modify resource allocations depending on the number samples. Submit your script as below:\n\n```bash\nsbatch maxquant.sh\n```\n\nWhen `maxquant` job is finished, your output files will be in this same directory.\n\n## Tutorial example\n\nYou can download example tutorial data for running MaxQuant as below:\n\n```bash\nwget https://a3s.fi/proteomics/MaxQuant_tutorial.tar.gz\n```\n\nand then untar the downloaded archive file as below:\n```bash\ntar -xavf  MaxQuant_tutorial.tar.gz\n```\n\nThe tutorial has example raw files and other necessary files to run MaxQuant for testing.\n\n\n## Look at the used resources once your job is finished\n\nOnce `maxquant` job is finished, you can check the utilization of computing resources\nlike [memory](../faq/how-much-memory-my-job-needs.md) and CPU usage efficiency.\nThis will help you tune with better parameters for efficient usage of computing resources.\n\nYou can use the following commands using job id:\n```\nseff <jobid>\nsacct –l –j <jobid>\nsacct -o jobid,jobname,maxrss,maxvmsize,state,elapsed -j <jobid>\n\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
