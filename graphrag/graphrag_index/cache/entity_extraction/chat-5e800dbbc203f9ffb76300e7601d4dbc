And a single SSH key pair has given access to that default user in that VM. This gives access to that VM to a single person, the one that created the VM and the one that owns the SSH **private** key. See the Wikipedia [Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) article for more information about SSH keys and the protocol in general.\n\nIt is a common use case (and a good practice for production services) that more than one person has access to the VM. The following procedure is one of the several options to accomplish that. We will create a new user and give access to that user to a single person.\n\n## Create a new user\n\n1. [Connect to the VM](/cloud/pouta/connecting-to-vm/) as the default user. This user has superuser privileges (`sudo`).\n\n1. Create the new user, see the [adduser](https://linux.die.net/man/8/adduser) manual for more information.\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo adduser -m <user>\n\t```\n\n!!! info \"Substitute `<user>` by the username you want to create\"\n\nThe user has been created in the VM, but nobody has access to it. To give access to this user, we need to configure the **Authorized Keys** for this account.\n\n## Configure Authorized keys\n\nBefore you start, you will need a **public** ssh key. This public key must have been created by the new person that will be given access to this VM. When an SSH key pair is created, two keys are created, the **public** SSH key and the **private** key. The public one can be publicly published to the whole world, for example, GitHub publishes the keys of all its users. On the other hand, the **private** key must never be shared with anyone, and should not leave the computer where it was created.\n\n### Create SSH key pair\n\nIt is recommended to create a new ssh key pair per user and service, this way if the **private** key is leaked, the damage is limited to that user in that service. If you use the same key for every VM, every one of them will be potentially compromised and will have to be recreated. In Linux and Mac you can create a new private/public key pair by doing:\n\n```sh\n$ ssh-keygen \nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa): \nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \nEnter same passphrase again: \nYour identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa\nYour public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:9MKfQAUs+b2tmpXjqsa0DinzFbW+9qdpFAPYKh4P1i8 ubuntu@ab-tests\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+---[RSA 3072]----+\n|       =...      |\n|      + +.       |\n|     . ++o       |\n|    = o=.o+      |\n|   o =..S .=     |\n|    ..Eo.+oo.    |\n|  o oo.o..*.     |\n|   + o+ .=oo.    |\n|    .ooo===o     |\n+----[SHA256]-----+\n```\n\nThe example above created two files: `id_rsa` the **private** key, and `id_rsa.pub` the **public** key. For reference, a **public** ssh key looks like this:\n\n\n```\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCoQ9S7V+CufAgwoehnf2TqsJ9LTsu8pUA3FgpS2mdVwcMcTs++8P5sQcXHLtDmNLpWN4k7NQgxaY1oXy5e25x/4VhXaJXWEt3luSw+Phv/PB2+aGLvqCUirsLTAD2r7ieMhd/pcVf/HlhNUQgnO1mupdbDyqZoGD/uCcJiYav8i/V7nJWJouHA8yq31XS2yqXp9m3VC7UZZHzUsVJA9Us5YqF0hKYeaGruIHR2bwoDF9ZFMss5t6/pzxMljU/ccYwvvRDdI7WX4o4+zLuZ6RWvsU6LGbbb0pQdB72tlV41fSefwFsk4JRdKbyV3Xjf25pV4IXOTcqhy+4JTB/jXxrF\n```\n\n!!! info \"The key above is [Linus Torvarld](https://github.com/torvalds.keys)'s public ssh key in github\"\n\n### Adding keys to `authorized_keys`\n\nOnce the new person has sent you the public key, you need to copy it to the server and add it to the `authorized_keys` \"database\" file:\n\n1. Upload the public key file to the server, from a Linux or Mac machine you can use `SCP` (Secure copy protocol):\n\n       ```sh\n       scp id_rsa.pub <default_user>@<floating_ip>:\n       ```\n\n       Note: The `<default_user>` is still the one found in the [image documentation](/cloud/pouta/images\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
