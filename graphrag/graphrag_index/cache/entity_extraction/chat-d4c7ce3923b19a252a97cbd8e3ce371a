We currently recommend that this variable should not be used for parallel R jobs with Stan.\n\n*Using R with the CmdStan backend* \n\nThe `r-env` module comes with a separate [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) installation that is specific to each module version.\nTo use it, one must set the correct path to CmdStan using `cmdstanr`. For example, for `r-env/440` this would be done as follows:\n\n```r\ncmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path(\"/appl/soft/math/r-env/440-stan/cmdstan-2.35.0\")\n```\n\nIf you are using CmdStan in an interactive session, the above command will work directly. For non-interactive batch jobs, the path to CmdStan needs to be separately set in the batch job file. This is done by including the following commands further to your other batch job file contents: \n\n```r\n# Set R version\nexport RVER=440\n\n# Launch R after binding CmdStan\nSING_FLAGS=\"$SING_FLAGS -B /appl/soft/math/r-env/${RVER}-stan:/appl/soft/math/r-env/${RVER}-stan\"\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save script.R\n```\n\nOther details on using the CmdStan backend are package-specific. As one example, one could use it with the [`brms`](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) package:\n\n```r\nlibrary(brms)\n\nfit_serial <- brm(\n  count ~ zAge + zBase * Trt + (1|patient),\n  data = epilepsy, family = poisson(),\n  chains = 4, cores = 4, backend = \"cmdstanr\"\n)\n```\n\nNote that [within-chain parallelisation with `brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_threading.html) requires a project-specific installation of CmdStan. Please contact [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md) for instructions.\n\n#### R package installations\n\nIt is possible to check if a particular package is already installed as follows.\n\n```r\n# One way is to try loading the package:\nlibrary(packagename)\n\n# If you don't want to load the package, it is also\n# possible to search through a list:\ninstalled_packages <- library()$results[,1]\n\"packagename\" %in% installed_packages\n\n# Note: both ways are sensitive to upper- and lower-case letters\n```\n\nAdditional R package installations can be arranged via two routes:\n\n- Project-specific installations can be used by creating a separate package directory in the `/projappl/<project>` directory (instructions below; also see [here](../computing/disk.md#projappl-directory) for information on ProjAppl)\n\n- Requests for general installations (provided to all users as part of the module): please contact [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md)\n\nTo make use of a project-specific package library, follow these instructions. First create a new folder inside your project directory. Note that the folder should be specific to the R version you are using (R packages installed using different `r-env` modules are not cross-compatible).\n\n```r\n# On the command prompt:\n# First navigate to /projappl/<project>, then\nmkdir project_rpackages_<rversion>\n```\n\nYou can then add the folder to your library trees in R:\n\n```r\n# Add this to your R code:\n.libPaths(c(\"/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_<rversion>\", .libPaths()))\nlibpath <- .libPaths()[1]\n\n# This command can be used to check that the folder is now visible:\n.libPaths() # It should be first on the list\n\n# Package installations should now be directed to the project\n# folder by default. You can also specify the path, e.g. install.packages(\"package\", lib = libpath)\n\n# Note that it's also possible to fetch the R version automatically using getRversion(). For example:\n.libPaths(paste0(\"/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_\", gsub(\"\\\\.\", \"\", getRversion()))) \n\n```\n\nTo use R packages installed in `/projappl`, add the following to the beginning of your R script. This modifies your library trees within a given R session only. In other words, you will need to run this each time when launching R:\n\n```r\n.libPaths(c(\"/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_<rversion>\", .libPaths()))\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can add the desired changes to an `.Renviron` file (only when not using RStudio):\n\n```bash\necho \"R_LIBS=/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_<rversion>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n```\n\n!!! note\n    When using `r-env`, user-defined changes to R library paths must be specified inside an R session or in relation to an `.Renviron` file. Other changes (e.g. using `export` to modify environment variables) will not work due to the R installation running inside an Apptainer container. If your analysis would require changes that cannot be achieved through the above means, please contact us for a module-wide package installation.\n\n#### Pdf rendering\n\nIf pdf rendering of an R Markdown or a Quarto document fails, run the following in R:\n\n```r\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\n\nWhen prompted about an existing LaTeX distribution, answer `yes` to continue the installation anyway.\n\n\n## Working with Allas\n\nThe `r-env` module comes with the [`aws.s3`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aws.s3/) package for working with S3 storage, which makes it possible to use the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
