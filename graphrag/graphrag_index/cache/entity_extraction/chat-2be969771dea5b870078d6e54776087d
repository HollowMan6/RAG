All IPs in this document and Rahti 2's system itself are ipv4 only, no ipv6 IP is used.\n\n## Namespaces\n\nRahti 2 is divided in **Namespaces**. Depending on the context, namespaces can be referred as **Projects**. Every object in Rahti 2 must belong to and run inside a namespace.\n\n## NetworkPolicy\n\nFrom a networking point of view, namespaces are configured by default to provide an isolated **VLAN** to everything that runs inside it, notably to [Pods](concepts.md#pod) and [Services](concepts.md#service). Traffic to any `Pod` or `Service` coming from outside the namespace (even from other namespaces in Rahti 2) will be blocked. The only traffic that will be able to pass from outside the namespace will be the one going through the `Route`. This isolation is obtained via [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/). It is possible to change this by editing the two `NetworkPolicy` objects that are created by default in Rahti 2.\n\n![Rahti 2 Networking](../img/rahti-network.drawio.svg)\n\n!!! Note \"Advanced networking\"\n    In the Administrator menu, under `Networking > NetworkPolicies` it is possible to browse and edit the default network policies, but only in YAML format. Only change the [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) if you are really sure of what you are doing.\n\n## Pods\n\n**Pods** are the basic unit in Kubernetes. They accommodate one or more containers that contain the software and the environment needed to run an application. Each Pod has a [**private** IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network), which is only reachable from inside the namespace/VLAN. It is not advisable to use these Pod IPs directly in applications, they are meant to be used by **Services**. This is because not only other Pods in other namespaces may share this private IP, but more importantly, when a Pod is recreated it will get a new IP.\n\nFor example, if we deploy the `nginx` image in a Pod. This Pod will get a random private IP like `10.1.1.200`. Any unprivileged port (`>=1024`) that the image exports, like for example `8081`, will be reachable in that IP. A Pod will fail to start if it tries to export a privileged port (`[0-1023]`). If the Pod is killed, normally due to a change in its configuration, but also possibly due to unexpected reasons like hardware failure, a new Pod with a different IP will be created, like for example `10.1.1.140`. These IPs will respond to traffic from within the namespace only. If we set up a Pod that will query the first IP (`10.1.1.200`), it will obviously stop working at the moment of the recreation of the Pod associated with it. This is why we use **services**.\n\n## Services\n\n**Services** (also abbreviated `svc`) provide a _stable_ [private IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network) to one or more Pods. This IP will act as a load balancer, distributing the traffic load between the Pods behind it. For this, the service will make sure to keep an updated list of IPs so requests are only sent to valid ones.\n\nServices are built to export one or more ports, and they also provide an internal DNS name. Any of these names are valid and will resolve to the same service IP:\n\n* `<service_name>`, e.g., nginx.\n* `<service_name>.<namespace>`, e.g., ngin.fenic\n* and `<service_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`, e.g., nginx.fenic.svc.cluster.local.\n\nIn the same manner as Pods, Rahti 2 Services can only be reached from inside the namespace they run, any request from another namespace will be able to resolve the DNS into an IP, but it will never connect. Another feature of services is that they can forward requests from one port to another target port (ex: 80 to 8080). This is useful in Rahti 2 as Pods cannot listen on privileged ports (`<1024`).\n\nServices can be used for internal connections. For example, if we have one or more MongoDB database replicas running in the `fenic` namespace, each in a different pod, and they export port `27017`. We can create a service called `mongo` associated with the pods under the same name. Then we can launch `nginx` Pods that run a Python application which will use the URL `<mongo:27017` to connect to the database. When connections to the service are attempted, one of the mongo pods will be selected to serve the data request.\n\n![nginx and Mongo](../img/mongo-nginx-app.drawio.svg)\n\n## Routes\n\n**Routes** are the OpenShift equivalent of _Ingress_ in vanilla Kubernetes, they expose a single port of a single Service object to traffic from outside the namespace and the Internet, via HTTP/HTTPS only. If the route is configured to provide no encrypted HTTP traffic, the pods associated should talk in HTTP non encrypted traffic. If the route is configured to provide TLS/HTTPS secure traffic, several options are available regarding the Route encryption:\n\n* **Edge**, this is the default and the simplest to configure. The Route provides the certificate, which is stored in the Route object itself. The traffic is decrypted and the Pod is contacted using plain text un-encrypted HTTPD traffic.\n* **Passthrough** is when the encryption is delegated to the pod, which must\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
