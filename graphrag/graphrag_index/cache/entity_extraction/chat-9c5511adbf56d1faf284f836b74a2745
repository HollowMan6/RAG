QGIS supports a very wide range of vector and raster formats and also common API protocols like WMS, WMTS, WCS and WFS. \n\nIn supercomputers, QGIS could be used for example to visualize the resulting files from processing with other tools: lastools, R, Python etc.\n\n\n## Available\n\n__QGIS__ is available with following versions:\n\n* 3.38 in Puhti, includes also [GDAL](gdal.md) and [PDAL](pdal.md). It also has PCRaster library installed to the container, but [PCRaster QGIS plug-in](https://jvdkwast.github.io/qgis-processing-pcraster/) should be added by each user.\n* 3.34 in Puhti, includes also [GDAL](gdal.md), [PDAL](pdal.md) and the new native point cloud tools in QGIS.\n* 3.31 in Puhti and LUMI, includes also [GDAL](gdal.md), [GrassGIS](grass.md), [PDAL](pdal.md) and [SagaGIS](saga-gis.md). \n* 3.22 in Puhti\n\n## Usage\n\n### QGIS in Puhti\n\nFor using QGIS, open it in Puhti web interface:\n\n1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi). \n2. Open [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). \n3. After launching the Desktop, double-click QGIS icon for the newest version.\n\nIf you want to use older version, open `Terminal` (Desktop icon) and start QGIS:\n\n```\nmodule load qgis/3.22\nqgis\n```\n\n### QGIS in LUMI\n\nUntil LUMI web interface is available, QGIS needs to be used with\n[SSH X11 forwarding](../computing/connecting/index.md#graphical-connection).\n\n```\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule load qgis\nqgis\n```\n\n### SagaGIS toolbox in QGIS\n\nSagaGIS tools are not available by default with QGIS 3.31 in Processing Toolbox, but can be added with installing `Saga Next Gen` plug-in. This is a new plug-in and all tools might not work yet.  \n\n### PyQGIS\n\nIt is also possible to access QGIS functionalities from Python without an graphical user interface with the [PyQGIS library](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/). Use `python3` for accessing PyQGIS libraries.\n\n\n### Puhti QGIS and Allas\n\nQGIS can __read__ files directly from Allas, either using S3 or SWIFT API. Before starting QGIS set up the connection as described in [Using geospatial files directly from cloud, inc Allas tutorial](../support/tutorials/gis/gdal_cloud.md) and then start QGIS from Terminal.\n\nWith large quantities of data in Allas, consider using [virtual rasters](https://research.csc.fi/virtual_rasters). \n\n## License \n\nQGIS is licensed under the GNU General Public License.\n\n## Citation\n\n```QGIS.org, 2024.
