There are two simple approaches to accomplish this task, \"get and clean\" or \"recreate from template\". We will first try the \"get and clean\" method.\n\n### Get and clean\n\nThe idea of get and clean is simple, we will retrieve a `yaml` representation of an object running in the Kubernetes cluster and then delete all unnecessary information, like status and default configuration options.\n\n#### Persistent Volume Claim\n\nGet the PVC object in YAML format into the file `pvc.yaml`:\n\n```sh\noc get persistentvolumeclaim/html -o yaml > pvc.yaml\n```\n\nMost of the information in the `YAML` retrieved is status information generated by OpenShift and can be deleted:\n\n```diff\n@@ -1,18 +1,7 @@\n apiVersion: v1\n kind: PersistentVolumeClaim\n metadata:\n-  annotations:\n-    pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed: \"yes\"\n-    pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: \"yes\"\n-    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/glusterfs\n-  creationTimestamp: \"2023-01-02T09:22:06Z\"\n-  finalizers:\n-  - kubernetes.io/pvc-protection\n   name: html\n-  namespace: test\n-  resourceVersion: \"1771053847\"\n-  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/test/persistentvolumeclaims/html\n-  uid: ed156002-8a7e-11ed-b60d-fa163e0d8841\n spec:\n   accessModes:\n   - ReadWriteOnce\n@@ -20,10 +9,4 @@\n     requests:\n       storage: 1Gi\n   storageClassName: glusterfs-storage\n-  volumeName: pvc-ed156002-8a7e-11ed-b60d-fa163e0d8841\n-status:\n-  accessModes:\n-  - ReadWriteOnce\n-  capacity:\n-    storage: 1Gi\n-  phase: Bound\n+status: {}\n```\n\nThe main fields are **metadata > name**, **spec > resources > requests > storage**, and **spec > storageClassName**, and the result will be:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: html\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n  storageClassName: standard-csi\nstatus: {}\n```\n\n#### Deployment\n\nThe same process can be repeated for `deployment.apps/nginx`:\n\n```sh\noc get deployment.apps/nginx -o yaml >deploy.yaml\n```\n\n* First, for the `image` used, we need to replace the `@sha256` hash by `:latest`. This way we will always get the actual latest version of the image. It is also possible to replace it by a specific version like `:1.23.3`.\n* Then we will delete the status information. An example of \"status\" entries are `lastTransitionTime` and `creationTimestamp`. This has no place to be in a template as it is information 100% generated by Kubernetes about the current running object, not the one we want to create.\n* Finally we will delete the auto-generated configuration options. An example of \"configuration options\" are the `rollingParams`. These configuration options are generated from the defaults of the Kubernetes cluster. It is also possible to keep these default options, so the user of the chart can change them before the creation is started, for example it could be necessary to increase the `timeoutSeconds` because the application takes more than 10 minutes to start.\n\n```diff\n@@ -1,44 +1,24 @@\n apiVersion: apps/v1\n kind: Deployment\n metadata:\n   labels:\n     app: nginx\n   name: nginx\n-  namespace: test\n-  resourceVersion: \"1771055913\"\n-  selfLink: /apis/apps.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/test/deployments/nginx\n-  uid: a828c0db-8a7e-11ed-b60d-fa163e0d8841\n spec:\n   replicas: 1\n   selector:\n     matchLabels:\n       app: nginx\n   strategy:\n-    activeDeadlineSeconds: 21600\n-    resources: {}\n-    rollingParams:\n-      intervalSeconds: 1\n-      maxSurge: 25%\n-      maxUnavailable: 25%\n-      timeoutSeconds: 600\n-      updatePeriodSeconds: 1\n     type: RollingUpdate\n   template:\n     metadata:\n-      annotations:\n-        openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftWebConsole\n-      creationTimestamp: null\n       labels:\n\t       app: nginx\n     spec:\n       containers:\n-      - image: bitnami/nginx@sha256:abe48bff022ec9c675612653292b2e685c91ce24bc4374199723c4f69603a127\n-        imagePullPolicy: Always\n+      - image: docker.io/bitnami/nginx:latest\n\t name: nginx\n\t ports:\n\t - containerPort: 8080\n@@ -46,21 +26,12 @@\n\t - containerPort: 8443\n\t   protocol: TCP\n\t resources: {}\n-        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log\n-        terminationMessagePolicy: File\n\t volumeMounts:\n\t - mountPath:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
