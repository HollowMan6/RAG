[In interactive mode](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) with local executor, with limited resources. Useful mainly for debugging or very small workflows.\n2. With batch job and local executor. Resource usage limited to one full node. Useful for small and medium size workflows, simpler than next options, start with this, if unsure.\n3. With batch job and SLURM executor. Can use multiple nodes and different SLURM partitions (CPU and GPU), but may create significant overhead, if many small jobs. Could be used, if each job step for each file takes at least 30 min.\n4. With batch job and HyperQueue as a sub-job scheduler. Can use multiple nodes in the same batch job allocation, most complex set up. Suits well for cases, when workflow includes a lot of small job steps with many input files (high-troughput computing).\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n        Please do not launch heavy Snakemake workflows on **login nodes**.\n\nThe following toy example illustrates how a Snakemake workflow can be deployed at CSC. \n\n### Snakefile\nSnakefile describes the contents of the workflow. Further information is available from [Snakemake Snakefile documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html)\n\nLet's use the following toy Snakemake script, `Snakefile` (with a capital S and no file extension), for the illustration:\n\n```bash title=\"Snakefile\"\nrule all:\n        input: \"CAPITAL_CASE.txt\"\n\nrule say_hello:\n        output: \"smaller_case.txt\"\n        shell:\n                \"\"\"\n                echo \"hello-world greetings from csc to snakemake community !\" > smaller_case.txt\n                \"\"\"\nrule capitalise:\n        input: \"smaller_case.txt\"\n        output: \"CAPITAL_CASE.txt\"\n        shell:\n                \"\"\"\n                tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < {input} > {output}\n                \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Running Snakemake workflow with local executor interactively\nThe resources are reserved in advance, both for Snakemake and the workflow jobs as **one interactive session**. In interactive session, the workflow can be started for several times for debugging as long as the reserved resources are available. See resource limits for [interactive partition](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md).\n\n```\nsinteractive --cores 4 --mem 10000 # start an interactive session with 2 CPU cores and 10 Gb of memory\nmodule load snakemake\ncd <to_folder_with_snakefile>\nsnakemake -s Snakefile --jobs 4\n```\n\n* `--jobs` - maximum number of jobs run in parallel\n\n### Running Snakemake workflow with local executor and batch job\nThe resources are reserved in advance, both for Snakemake and the workflow as **one batch job**. The job will run as long as the snakemake command is running and stop automatically when it finishes. Local executor is limited to one node of supercomputer. The number of cores can be extended depending on the system - 40 in Puhti and 128 in Mahti.\n\n```bash title=\"snakemake-local-executor.sh\"\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=myTest\n#SBATCH --account=project_xxxxx\n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n\nmodule load snakemake\nsnakemake -s Snakefile --jobs 4\n```\nFinally, you can submit the batch job from the login node:\n\n```bash\nsbatch snakemake-local-executor.sh\n```\n\n### Running Snakemake workflow with SLURM executor\nThe first batch job file reserves resources only for Snakemake itself. Snakemake then creates further SLURM jobs for workflow's rules. The SLURM jobs created by Snakemake may be distributed to several nodes of a supercomputer and also to use different partitions for different workflow rules, for example CPU and GPU. SLURM executor should be used only, if the job steps are at least 20-30 minutes long, otherwise the it could overload SLURM.\n\nHere is a bash script for running the above toy example with SLURM executor:\n\n```bash title=\"snakemake-slurm-executor.sh\"\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=snakemake_slurm\n#SBATCH --account=project_2008498\n#SBATCH --time=00:20:00\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2GB\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --output=slurm-%j.out\n#SBATCH --error=slurm-%j.err\n\nmodule load snakemake\nsnakemake --jobs 4  -s Snakefile --executor slurm --default-resources slurm_account=project_xxxx slurm_partition=small\n```\n!!! info \"Note\"\n        Make sure that the Snakemake own reservation is long enough to include also waiting time for other processes to get processed, including queueing time. Rather use too long time for the Snakemake own batch job.\n\nDefault resources for each SLURM job are rather limited, to increase (or change) define the resource needs for each rule in the Snakefile:\n```\nrule say_hello:\n        output: \"smaller_case.txt\"\n        resources:\n                runtime = 5, # minutes\n                cpus_per_task = 1\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snakemake is a workflow management system that allows the execution of workflows in supercomputers in various modes including interactive, batch job with local executor, SLURM executor, and HyperQueue sub-job scheduler)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC refers to the IT center for science in Finland, providing computing resources where Snakemake workflows can be deployed)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is one of the supercomputers at CSC, allowing up to 40 cores for local executor workflows)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is another supercomputer at CSC, supporting up to 128 cores for local executor workflows)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used for submitting jobs to clusters, supercomputers, and computing clouds)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>CSC<|>Snakemake workflows can be deployed at CSC's computing resources<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>PUHTI<|>Snakemake workflows can run on Puhti with up to 40 cores in local executor mode<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>MAHTI<|>Snakemake workflows can run on Mahti with up to 128 cores in local executor mode<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>SLURM<|>Snakemake can create SLURM jobs for workflow's rules, distributing them across several nodes<|>6)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
