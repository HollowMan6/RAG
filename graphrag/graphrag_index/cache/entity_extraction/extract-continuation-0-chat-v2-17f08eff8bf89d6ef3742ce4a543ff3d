Identify all entities.

We recommend the\n[Allas object storage service](../../data/Allas/introduction.md) for storing\nresearch data that is not actively used on the supercomputers. See\n[guidelines for managing data on Puhti and Mahti scratch disks](clean-up-data.md)\nfor more information. Also note that sensitive data must not be processed or\nstored on CSC supercomputers. For this purpose we have separate\n[sensitive data services](../../data/sensitive-data/index.md).\n\nCSC supercomputers also have a persistent project-based storage with a default\nquota of 50 GB. It is located under  \n`/projappl/<project>` and recommended, for example, for custom software\ninstallations. Additionally, each user can store up to 10 GB of data in their\npersonal home directory (`$HOME`).\n\n[Moving data](../../data/moving/index.md) between a supercomputer and a local\nworkstation is easy using the\n[web interface file browser](../../data/moving/web-interface.md) or\ncommand-line file transfer tools like [scp](../../data/moving/scp.md) and\n[rsync](../../data/moving/rsync.md). You can also use the\n[Linux wget utility](../../data/moving/wget.md) to download data to\na supercomputer directly from a website or FTP server.\n\n!!! note \"CSC does not back up your data!\"\n    None of the disk areas are automatically backed up by CSC. This means that\n    data accidentally deleted by the user cannot be recovered in any way. To\n    avoid unintended data loss, make sure to regularly back up your data, for\n    example to Allas or your own organization's storage systems.\n\n## Useful links\n\nYou can use the navigation sidebar or the search function to find more\ninformation about using CSC HPC services.
