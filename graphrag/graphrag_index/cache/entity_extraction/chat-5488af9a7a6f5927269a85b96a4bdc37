was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.\n\nThe exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.\n\nThey were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.\n\nThe Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also

'00:15:00';\nc.AdditionalProperties.CPUsPerNode = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.MemPerCPU = '4g';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GpuCard = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GPUsPerNode = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.EmailAddress = '';\n```\n\nNow, we can use the batch command to create a parallel pool of workers by setting the `'Pool'` argument to the amount of cores we want to reserve.\nFor example, we can submit a parallel job to eight cores as follows:\n\n```matlab\nj = batch(c, @funcParallel, 1, {8}, 'Pool', 8, 'CurrentFolder', '.', 'AutoAddClientPath', false)\n```\n\nNote that the parallel pool will always request one additional CPU core to manage the batch job and pool of cores.\nFor example, a job that needs eight cores will consume nine CPU cores.\n\n\n### Submitting serial GPU jobs\nWe can create a GPU reservation by setting the appropriate values for the `Partition`, `GpuCard`, and `GPUsPerNode` properties.\nFor example, a single GPU reservation looks as follows:\n\n```matlab\nc = parcluster;\n% Replace 'project_id' to your project identifier, otherwise the script will fail.\nc.AdditionalProperties.ComputingProject = 'project_id';\nc.AdditionalProperties.Partition = 'gpu';\nc.AdditionalProperties.WallTime = '00:15:00';\nc.AdditionalProperties.CPUsPerNode = 1;\nc.AdditionalProperties.MemPerCPU = '4g';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GpuCard = 'v100';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GPUsPerNode = 1;\nc.AdditionalProperties.EmailAddress = '';\n```\n\nNow, we can submit a simple GPU job that queries the available GPU device as follows:\n\n```matlab\nj = batch(c, @gpuDevice, 1, {}, 'CurrentFolder', '.', 'AutoAddClientPath', false)\n```\n\n\n### Querying jobs and output\nTo retrieve a list of currently running or completed jobs, use\n\n```matlab\nc = parcluster;\nc.Jobs\n```\n\nGet a handle to the job with sequence number 1\n\n```matlab\nj = c.Jobs(1);\n```\n\nOnce we have a handle to the cluster, we'll call the `findJob` method to search for the job with the specified job ID, on example below `ID = 11`.\n\n```matlab\nj = findJob(c, 'ID', 11);\n```\n\nOnce the job has been completed, we can fetch the function outputs as follows:\n\n```matlab\nfetchOutputs(j)\n```\n\nData that has been written to files on the cluster needs to be retrieved directly from the file system.\n\n\n<!--\nOnce we've identified the job we want, we can retrieve the results as we've done previously.\nIf the job has produced an error, we can call the `getDebugLog` method to view the error log file.\nThe error log can be lengthy and is not shown here.\n\nAs an example, we will retrieve the debug log of the serial job.\n\n```matlab\ngetDebugLog(j.Parent, j.Tasks(1))\n```\n\nFor debugging, retrieve the log file.\n\n```matlab\ngetDebugLog(j.Parent ,j)\n```\n-->\n\n\n<!--\n### Checking license status\nYou can check the status of MPS licenses on Puhti after logging in with `scontrol` command.\n\n```bash\nscontrol show lic=mdcs\n```\n\n```text\nLicenseName=mdcs\n    Total=500 Used=320 Free=180 Remote=no\n```\n-->\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model":
