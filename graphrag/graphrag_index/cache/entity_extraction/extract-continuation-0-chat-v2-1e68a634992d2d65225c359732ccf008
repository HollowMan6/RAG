As a major highlight, this\nrelease includes the new OPLS5 polarizable force field. See\n[release notes](https://www.schrodinger.com/life-science/download/release-notes/)\nfor the full list of new features and improvements.\n\n## PyTorch 2.3.1, 13.6.2024\n\n[PyTorch](../../apps/pytorch.md) 2.3.1 added to Puhti and Mahti. The\nLUMI installation will be delayed until early autumn due to an\nincompatible ROCm driver version. This version has also updated how\nPython commands are wrapped, as this solves several problems with\nusing virtual environments and Jupyter Notebooks. Due to this\n`apptainer` and `apptainer_wrapper` commands will no longer work, but\notherwise the change should be invisible to users. See our [PyTorch\nmodule documentation for more\ninformation](../../apps/pytorch.md#available).\n\n## Python Data 3.10-24.04 now the default version\n\nThe recently installed `python-data/3.10-24.04` has been set as the\ndefault version for [Python Data](../../apps/python-data.md).\n\n## R 4.4.0 in r-env, 7.6.2024\n\nR version 4.4.0 is now available in `r-env` in Puhti and is set as the default version. The new version will be available in RStudio in the Puhti web interface shortly.\n\n## Molpro 2024.1 is available on Puhti, 5.6.2024\n\nThe new [Molpro 2024.1](../../apps/molpro.md) includes new features like\na CAS(2,2) version of icMRCCSD. Check the\n[Recent changes](https://www.molpro.net/manual/doku.php?id=recent_changes)\nfor a detailed list of new features, bug fixes and improvements.\n\n## GROMACS 2024.2, 22.5.2024\n\n[GROMACS](../../apps/gromacs.md) 2024.2 is now available on Puhti, Mahti and LUMI.\nNew GPU versions on LUMI have been compiled to use the instant submission mode of\nAdaptiveCpp, which can improve performance and scalability in some cases by more\nthan 10%. See [release notes](https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.2/release-notes/2024/2024.2.html)\nfor a list of all new features and improvements.\n\n## Schrödinger Maestro 2024.2, 3.5.2024\n\n[Schrödinger Maestro](../../apps/maestro.md) version 2024.2 has been installed\nand set as the default module on Puhti and Mahti.

See\n[release notes](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/releases/tag/v2024.1)\nfor a list of new features, fixes and breaking changes. As a notable change,\ncalculations will now abort instead of just issuing a warning if the SCF cycle\nfails to converge. Add `IGNORE_CONVERGENCE_FAILURE` keyword in the `&SCF`\nsection to enable the old behavior.\n\n## NAMD 3.0b6 available on LUMI, 12.3.2024\n\nThe latest AMD GPU-enabled version of NAMD is now available pre-installed\non LUMI.
