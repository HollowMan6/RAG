Wrap the container with:\n\n```bash\nwrap-container -w /usr/local/bin docker://quay.io/biocontainers/metabat2:2.15--h986a166_1 --prefix /projappl/<project>/$USER/metabat-2.15    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n‚òùüèª The `-w` option specifies the installation directory *inside the container*. For containers from Bioconda this is always `/usr/local/bin`.\n\n‚òùüèª The `--prefix` option is used to indicate the directory where we want to install the software.\n\nüí° After the installations finishes, the executables of the program will be in the directory `metabat-2.15/bin`. Note that these are not the actual binaries, but rather wrapper scripts for the executables *inside the container*. You can, however, use them as if they were the actual commands.\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 10\"}\n11. Add the `bin` directory to your `$PATH` as suggested by Tykky. This is analogous to activating the Conda environment in case of a direct Conda installation and allows you to execute commands from anywhere (without providing the full path to the binaries):\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"/projappl/<project>/$USER/metabat-2.15/bin:$PATH\"    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 11\"}\n12. Try opening the help for the `metabat` command:\n\n```bash\nmetabat --help\n```\n\nüóØ See here [how to install containers from other sources such as the BioContainer registry or local image files](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/bioconda-tutorial/#containers-from-other-source).\n\n## More information\n\n### Using modules in a batch script\n\nüí¨ Make sure to load all necessary modules and export required paths also in your batch scripts before launching any actual commands. It is good practice to start with `module purge` to ensure that you are working in a clean environment.\n\n‚òùüèª Note that if you are writing a batch script that uses applications from different modules, you should be mindful of the order in which you load (and possibly unload) the modules. Loading one module might automatically replace other ones to avoid conflicts.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
