With an interactive job, you request time and resources to work on a\ncompute node directly, which is different to a batch job where you submit your\njob to a queue for later execution.\n\nYou can use two commands to create an interactive session: `srun` and `salloc`.\nBoth of these commands take [options similar to `sbatch`][sbatch-options].\n\n## Using `salloc`\n\nUsing `salloc`, you allocate resources and spawn a shell used to\nexecute parallel tasks launched with `srun`. For example, you can allocate 2\nnodes for 30 minutes with the command\n\n```bash\n$ salloc --nodes=2 --account=<project> --partition=<partition> --time=00:30:00\nsalloc: Granted job allocation 123456\nsalloc: Waiting for resource configuration\n```\n\nOnce the allocation is made, this command will start a shell **on the login\nnode**. You can start parallel execution on the allocated nodes with `srun`.\n\n```bash\n$ srun --ntasks=32 --cpus-per-task=8 ./mpi_openmp_application\n```\n\nAfter the execution of your application ended, the allocation can be terminated\nby exiting the shell (`exit`).\n\nWhen using `salloc`, a shell is spawned on the login node. If you want to\nobtain a shell on the first allocated compute node you can use `srun --pty`.\n\n```bash\n$ srun --cpu_bind=none --nodes=2 --pty bash -i\n```\n\nIf you want to use an application with a GUI, you can use the `--x11` flag with\n`srun` to enable X11 forwarding.\n\n## Using `srun`\n\nFor simple interactive session, you can use `srun` with no prior allocation. In\nthis scenario, `srun` will first create a resource allocation in which to run\nthe job. For example, to allocate 1 node for 30 minutes and spawn a shell\n\n```bash\n$ srun --account=<project> --partition=<partition> --time=00:30:00 --nodes=1 --pty bash\n```\n\n## Using `srun` to check running jobs\n\nCurrently, `ssh`'ing to compute nodes is not allowed, but the `srun` command can\nbe used to check in on a running job in the cluster. In this case, you need to\ngive the job ID and possibly also the specific name of a compute node to `srun`.\n\nThis starts a shell where you can run any command on the first allocated node\nin a specific job:\n\n```bash\n$ srun --overlap --pty --jobid=<jobid> $SHELL\n```\n\nBy default, you will be connected to the master node of your job which is the \nfirst node in your allocation and the one on which your batch script is executed. \n\nIf your job spans multiple nodes and you need to connect to a specific compute node,\nyou can achieve this by adding the `-w nid00XXXX` option.\n\n```bash\n$ srun --overlap --pty --jobid=<jobid> -w nid00XXXX $SHELL\n```\n\nwhere `nid00XXXX` is the hostname of the node you wish to access. To obtain the\nlist of allocated nodes for a specific job with ID `<jobid>`, you can utilize \nthe following command:\n\n```bash\n$ sacct --noheader -X -P -oNodeList --jobs=<jobid>\n```\n\n!!! note \"GPUs resource specification\"\n\n    Depending on how you have specified the GPU resources allocated to your job, \n    you may encounter the following error when attempting to attach to a running\n    job:\n\n    ```bash\n    srun: error: Unable to create step for job 4203072: Invalid generic \n                  resource (gres) specification\n    ```\n\n    This error arises when you specify the number of GPUs using the\n    `--gpus=<numgpus>` option, i.e., the total number of GPUs to allocate to\n    your job. This value is inherited from the job and when creating the \n    interactive job step and lead to an error if there are fewer available GPUs\n    on the node you try to access than what you specified with `--gpus`.\n\n    If you encounter the aforementioned error message, you have to specify a\n    number  of GPUs corresponding to the actual number of GPUs allocated on the\n    node you try to access:\n    \n    ```bash\n    srun --overlap --pty --jobid=<jobid> --gpus=<numgpus> $SHELL\n    ```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SRUN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command used to create an interactive session or check on running jobs in a compute cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALLOC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command used to allocate resources and spawn a shell for executing parallel tasks in a compute cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MPI_OPENMP_APPLICATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An example application that can be executed in parallel on a compute cluster)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALLOC<|>SRUN<|>Salloc is used to allocate resources before starting parallel execution with Srun<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SRUN<|>MPI_OPENMP_APPLICATION<|>Srun is used to execute applications like MPI_OpenMP_Application on allocated compute nodes<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
