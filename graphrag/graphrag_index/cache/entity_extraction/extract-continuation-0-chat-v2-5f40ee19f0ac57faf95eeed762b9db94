Each DAC is linked to a specific dataset present in the SD Apply catalogue. DAC members can process data access applications separately, thus only one DAC member needs to approve or reject the application. The SD Apply user interface guides you during the data access revision process. For more information about SD Apply and the data approval process, please check [SD Apply user guide](./sd-apply.md).\n\n## Approval process overview\n[![FEGA approval process overview](images/fega/fega_dac_overview.png)](images/fega/fega_dac_overview.png)\n\n## Step 1: Confirm availability\nWhen a dataset you are associated with is uploaded to Finnish FEGA, you will receive an automated email via SD Apply asking you to confirm your availability to act as a Data Access Committee member. Follow the link in your email or log in directly to SD Apply at <https://sd-apply.csc.fi/> and confirm your availability. \n \n## Step 2: Login\nAs a DAC member you receive an email notification via SD Apply, when an applicant applies for data access. Log into SD Apply with your Haka or ELIXIR account. \n\n## Step 3: Process applications\nIn SD Apply, under “Actions”, check the following information sent by the applicant: name, affiliation, role, summary of their research, duration of the research project etc. Check also was the Data Access Agreement (DAA) accepted. You can ask for more information from the applicant if necessary.\n\n## Step 4: Approve or reject\nNext, you can decide if the application is approved or rejected. Please give a motivation in the “Add comments” field in the “Approve or reject” section. The final decision is sent to the applicant with information on how the dataset can be accessed using SD Desktop.\n\n[![SD Apply processing applications](images/fega/fega_dac.png)](images/fega/fega_dac.png)\n\n!!! note\n    Every action is recorded in SD Apply (e.g. previous applications from the same applicant are available).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A committee established during the data submission process to manage communication with data applicants and process data access applications through SD Apply)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD APPLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An interface used for managing communication between DAC and data applicants, guiding users through the data access revision process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platform where datasets are uploaded and associated with DAC members who confirm their availability to act as committee members)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An account system used for logging into SD Apply)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIXIR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An account system used for logging into SD Apply)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>SD APPLY<|>DAC uses SD Apply to manage communication and process applications<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD APPLY<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>SD Apply sends automated emails for dataset confirmation on Finnish FEGA<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAKA<|>SD APPLY<|>HAKA accounts can be used to log into SD Apply<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIXIR<|>SD APPLY<|>ELIXIR accounts can be used to log into SD Apply<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
