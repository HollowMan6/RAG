By default, the command uses its own *7z*\ncompression file format, but it can utilize other compression file\nformats too.\n\nIn Puhti, 7zip is launched with command `7z`. To get access to the\ncommand, first load the required module with:\n\n```bash\nmodule load p7zip\n```\n\nThe basic syntax of the command is:\n\n```bash\n7z command -options archive_file file_names\n```\n\nThe most important 7zip options are:\n\n- `a` add files to an archive\n- `e` extract files from an archive file\n- `l` list files in the archive file\n\nTo archive and compress the sample directory `project_3`, which\ncontains the files `sample1.txt`, `sample2.txt`, ..., `sample9.txt` (the\nsame example that was used in the tar chapter), use the command:\n\n```bash\n$ 7z a project_3_backup project_3/\n\n7-Zip [64] 16.02 : Copyright (c) 1999-2016 Igor Pavlov : 2016-05-21\np7zip Version 16.02 (locale=en_US.UTF-8,Utf16=on,HugeFiles=on,64 bits,16 CPUs Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz (206D7),ASM,AES-NI)\n\nScanning the drive:\n1 folder, 9 files, 211442 bytes (207 KiB)\n\nCreating archive: project_3_backup.7z\n\nItems to compress: 10\n\nFiles read from disk: 9\nArchive size: 42728 bytes (42 KiB)\nEverything is Ok\n```\n\nThis created a new 7z-compressed file `project_3_backup.7z`. The `7z a`\ncommand can also be used to add a new file to an existing archive. For example,\nif we would get a new sample file called `sample10.txt` to the `project_3`\ndirectory, we could add it to the previously created\n`project_3_backup.7z` file with command:\n\n```bash\n7z a project_3_backup project_3/sample10.txt\n```\n\nYou can list the contents of this file with `7z l` command.

You can extract just\nthe defined files, for example:\n\n```bash\n7z e project_3_backup.7z project_3/sample3.txt\n```\n\nNote that if you choose to extract just individual files:\n\n1. you must use the full file path that is given in the file listing, and\n2. the specified compressed file is extracted to the current directory and not\n   to a directory path defined in the compressed file name. Thus, the above\n   command would return a file `sample3.txt` to the directory where the\n   command was executed.\n\nThe output directory of the extracted files can be defined with option\n`-o`.
