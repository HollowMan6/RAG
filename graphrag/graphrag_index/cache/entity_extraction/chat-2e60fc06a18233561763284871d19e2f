To create this new DNS name, you need to contact your DNS provider (in the example the administrators of `myuniversity.fi`) and request the new DNS record to point to your floating IP. Once created, the DNs record will take few minutes to propagate through the internet and will be visible globally.\n\n\nIn most cases, these forward DNS records (`name -> IP`) are enough.But some services will also require the reverse DNS lookups (`IP -> name`) to work. This means that we have to\nconfigure Pouta's DNS server to say that the floating IP you are using\nresolves back to the domain name you set up (`mywebsite.myuniversity.fi`).\n\nYou can request a reverse DNS mapping by sending an email to <servicedesk@csc.fi> with this information:\n\n1. The DNS name that you already configured to point to the desired floating IP.\n1. The Project name where the Virtual machine is.\n1. A short description of the use case that creates the need for this reverse record.\n\n!!! info \"\"\n    You do not need to let us know if the floating IP is moved to another machine within the same project. The reverse DNS record will stay as it is.\n\nWhen you no longer need the mapping, please contact us again in <servicedesk@csc.fi> so we can remove the reverse DNS entry.\n\n!!! warning \"Obsolete records will be purged\"\n    We reserve the right to clean up old reverse DNS records where the forward DNS records do not match anymore, or when the project is closed.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
