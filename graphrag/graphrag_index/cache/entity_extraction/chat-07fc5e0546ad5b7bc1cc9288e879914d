The following instructions show how to set up cPouta remote graphics environment. If you do not need an GPU accelerated environment for remote desktop here is instructions to set up a [Remote Desktop environment](how-to-use-pouta-for-remote-desktop.md). For GPU use, you need to install X, VNC, and VirtualGL servers. Once installed, the servers stay running also when you exit your SSH session. To return to using cPouta remote graphics, just open one secure SSH connection. The general procedure will be explained and some examples given. Part of the information is also available as a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/An1e9ryS3nY).\n\nThe instructions are mainly for cPouta Ubuntu 18 image but the principles apply to the other linux distros. Ubuntu is a good choice if latest features are needed. Brief CentOS instructions are also provided at the end. These installations are minimal. Some applications require additional packages to run properly. Although cPouta CUDA images can be reconfigured for rendering, it is recommended to do the installation from scratch.\n\n[TOC]\n  \n## Ubuntu installation\n\nAfter launching a cPouta Ubuntu image, update package lists, install X server and Openbox windows manager\n\n```\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xorg openbox\n```\n\n_(Skip the following driver installation if you are using a CUDA image.)_ First install linux kernel sources, which are needed for NVIDIA driver compilation to work. Then download the NVIDIA driver that is best suited to your needs. In this example a recent driver 450.51.06 is used. See NVIDIA web pages for the available linux drivers (cPouta has Tesla P100 cards).\n\n```\nsudo apt install build-essential libglvnd-dev pkg-config\nsudo wget http://uk.download.nvidia.com/tesla/450.51.06/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.51.06.run\n```\n\nWhen you run the NVIDIA installation script, you'll get a warning that 32-bit compatibility libraries will not be installed, which is fine for most cases. If you do need 32-bit support, run first `sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib`\n\n```\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.51.06.run\n```\n\n_(Continue from here if you are using a CUDA image.)_ Configure X for the NVIDIA driver with **nvidia-xconfig** tool. It will find out the card's BusID address (PCI:0:5:0 in this example, replace with your query result), which will be used to create a X configuration file. Ignore the configuration file related warning.\n\n```\nnvidia-xconfig --query-gpu-info\nsudo nvidia-xconfig --busid=PCI:0:5:0\n```\n\nVirtualGL middleware is needed to direct graphics to the NVIDIA card, and VNC server will stream the rendered graphics to your local VNC client. Download and install VirtualGL and TurboVNC servers. (You will also need a VNC client app on your local PC, see below.)\n\n```\nwget https://netix.dl.sourceforge.net/project/virtualgl/2.6.4/virtualgl_2.6.4_amd64.deb\nwget https://kumisystems.dl.sourceforge.net/project/turbovnc/2.2.5/turbovnc_2.2.5_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i virtualgl_*.deb turbovnc_*.deb\n```\n\nConfigure the VirtualGL server. If you are the only user on the virtual machine, answer **No** to all questions (choose: 1,n,n,n,x). More info is available at [virtualgl.org/Documentation/](https://virtualgl.org/Documentation/)\n\n```\nsudo vglserver_config\n```\nReboot your cPouta virtual machine at this stage, before continuing.\n\nAfter the reboot, start the VNC server. Define your virtual desktop window size by the _geometry_ parameter. Leaving it out defaults to 1240x900. The first time the VNC server is started, it will ask to create a password. When prompted, type (up to) 8 character password (twice), then reply **No** to a view-only password. You will need this TurboVNC password later, when connecting via your local PC's VNC viewer client. See **Usage** below. More info is available at [turbovnc.org/Documentation/](https://turbovnc.org/Documentation/)\n\n```\n/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -geometry 1920x1080\n```\n\nStart your X server (you need to hit _return_ twice), and set display number to 0.\n\n```\nsudo /usr/bin/X :0 &\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n```\n\nNow the GPU is ready to be used via your local VNC viewer, as described below. You'll need to have one secure SSH tunnel open for the VNC connection. The servers will keep on running when exiting SSH. If you reboot your virtual machine, run the last three commands above, to start the servers again.\n\n  \n## Usage - how to use cPouta remote graphics\n\nInstall TurboVNC 2.2.5 viewer to your local desktop PC from [sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/)\n\nOpen an encrypted SSH tunnel for the VNC connection between your PC and the virtual machine (VM). The port used by TurboVNC server is shown when TurboVNC starts: _Turbo\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
