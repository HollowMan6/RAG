Warning \"DeploymentConfig is deprecated\"\n    DeploymentConfig is deprecated in newer versions of OpenShift OKD and will be completely removed in the future. See Redhat's [deprecation announcement of DeploymentConfig](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7041372) and their [replacement guide for DeploymentConfig](https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:replace-deprecated-deploymentconfigs-deployments/resource/resources:convert-deploymentconfig-deployment).\n\n### How to create routes?\n\n!!! info \"Default URLs suffix have changed\"\n\n    In Rahti 1 default URLs were `<whatever>.rahtiapp.fi` meanwhile in Rahti 2 it will be `<whatever>.2.rahtiapp.fi`\n\nA Route can be created by going to the project details page, and click in Routes.\n\n![Project page](../img/project_page2.png)\n\nAnd then click in \"Create Route\"\n\n![Create Route](../img/create_route.png)\n\nA Route has two compulsory parameters:\n\n* a `name`, which must be unique within the project.\n* a `service`/`port`, which is where the traffic will be routed to.\n\nOther optional parameters are:\n\n* a `hostname`, which must be unique within Rahti. If none is provided, the hostname will be autogenerated by using the route `name` and the `project name`.\n* `Secure Route` can be activated to activate TLS encryption (Only TLS v1.3 and v1.2 are supported in Rahti 2, Rahti 1 only support TLS v1.2). The options are similar than in [Rahti 2 Routes](../rahti2/networking.md#routes)\n\n### How to edit a route?\n\nA Route can be edited by going to the project details page, click in Route, and then click in the route name you would like to edit.\n\nThen click in Actions > Edit Route. A YAML representation of the route will appear. You can edit it following the example at the [Concepts Route](../rahti2/concepts.md#route) page. If for example you want to add TLS support (https support), you need to add inside the `spec` section:\n\n```\nspec:\n  tls:\n    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect\n    termination: edge\n```\n\nWhere `Redirect` tells the route to redirect users from http to https automatically.\n\n![Route modes](../img/route-modes.drawio.svg)\n\n### What changes must be made in firewalls?\n\nThe egress IP used in Rahti 2 is different that for Rahti 1 had. This means that if you have a firewall rule opening for traffic coming from Rahti 1, the IP has to be updated. The Rahti 1 IP is `193.167.189.25` and the new one for Rahti 2 is `86.50.229.150`.\n\n!!! warning \"egress IP may change\"\n\n    The egress IP of Rahti 2 might change in the future. For example, if several versions of Rahti 2 are run in parallel each will have a different IP. Or if a major change in the underlining network infrastructure happens.\n\nSome project with dedicated egress IPs will have to request a new dedicated IP in Rahti 2 and update their firewalls accordingly.\n\n### How to manage users in project?\n\nRahti 2 will synchronize the Rahti 2 project members with the CSC project members. Any member of the linked CSC project will get **Admin** access to the Rahti 2 project. The membership of the CSC project can be then handled in <my.csc.fi>. For example, we have the CSC project 1000123, we can go to <my.csc.fi> and add or remove members. We can create few Rahti 2 projects and link each of them to 1000123. A couple of minutes after creation, all members of the CSC project will be Admins of each of the Rahti 1 projects.\nIn the project details page select \"Project access\".\nIt is also possible to add permissions manually to specific users that are not member of the CSC project and maybe that we do not want to make Admins. In the **Project** page in the Developer section, select \"Project access\".\n\n![Manage users](../img/manage_users.png)\n\nYou just need to write the user's user name, and a role level: `admin`, `Edit` or `View`. To save the changes, just click in `Save`. The different access that each role level has can be checked out in the linked documentation in the page itself.\n\n### How to delete project?\n\nA project can be deleted from the Project details page (`Developer` > `Project`), by selecting `Actions` > `Delete project`. A dialog to confirm the deletion will appear:\n\n![Delete Project](../img/delete_project.png)\n\nThe name of the project (`app-config` in this example) has to be typed in before the project is deleted. This is just to avoid accidental deletion.\n\n### How to use storage?\n\nIn the Project details page (`Developer` > `Project`), click `PersistentVolumeClaims` and then click in `Create PersistentVolumeClaim`.\n\n![Create PersistentVolumeClaim](../img/Create_PersistentVolumeClaim.png)\n\n* For the moment only a single type of `StorageClass` can be used. It corresponds to `Cinder` volumes, which can only be read or write by a single Pod.\n\n* A unique name within the project must be provided.\n\n* A size within the quota limits has to be defined.\n\n* The Volume mode should be `Filesystem`.\n\n!!! warning \"Lazy volume creation\"\n    The volume will only be\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
