Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Exporting the results from the private desktop.\n\n    Once the results are encrypted, only the CSC project manager can export the files with the Airlock client. \n\n    Open the terminal (right-click) and type the following syntax:\n\n    ```text\n    airlock-client  <<username>> <<data_output_bucket>> <<filename>>\n    ```\n\n    Where `username` is your CSC account username, `data_output_bucket` is the name that you want to give to the bucket into which the results are exported. The airlock client will generate the bucket automatically in the same CSC project in which your Desktop is. `filename` is the name of the encrypted files that you want to export.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```text\n    airlock-client cscuser  analysis-2022  results-03.csv.c4gh\n    ```\n\n    Press enter and add your password. Note: if you try to upload an unencrypted file, the airlock client will automatically encrypt it with the Sensitive Data public key for security reasons and export it to SD Connect. Here, you will be able to download the file, but you will not be able to decrypt it.\n\n    The fact that only project manager can export data from SD Desktop makes taking back-up copies of important files difficult for normal users. \n    If needed, the project manager can launch a back-up server process that normal users can utilize to do backups. For details, see:\n\n    * [SD Desktop Back-up server tutorial](tutorials/backup_sd_desktop.md)\n\n6. Download and decrypt the files.\n\n    The exported file is now available in SD Connect/Allas. After downloading the file in your local environment, you can decrypt it with your secret encryption key, using the Crypt4GH application or programmatically.
