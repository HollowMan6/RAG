These login nodes are shared by all users and they are **not**\nintended for heavy computing.\n\nThe login nodes should be used only for:\n\n* compiling\n* managing batch jobs\n* moving data\n* **light** pre- and postprocessing\n\nHere **light** means **one-core jobs** that finish in **minutes** and require\n**less than 1 GiB** of memory at maximum. All other tasks are to be done in\ncompute nodes either as normal [batch jobs](running/getting-started.md) or as\n[interactive batch jobs](running/interactive-usage.md). Programs not adhering to\nthese rules will be terminated without warning.\n\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n    The login nodes are not meant for long or heavy processes.\n\n## Disk cleaning\n\nEach project has disk space in the directory `/scratch/<project>`. This fast\nparallel scratch space is intended for data that is in active use. To ensure\nthat the parallel disk system does not run out of storage space and to keep\nperformance acceptable,\n[CSC automatically removes files](../support/tutorials/clean-up-data.md#automatic-removal-of-files)\nin scratch that have not\nbeen accessed in a long time. The performance of a parallel file system starts\nto degrade when it fills up, and the more it fills up, the slower the performance\nwill get.\n\nThe current policy in Puhti is that files that have not been accessed for\n**6 months** or more will be removed. This cleaning will happen regularly,\nand each time users are informed at least 1 month in advance. CSC also provides\nlists of files that are about to be removed and instructions for how one can\ntransfer important files to more suitable disk systems.\n\nA similar procedure will be introduced on Mahti, but it is not yet in place.\nThe policy is still that users should keep only actively used data in scratch.\n\n## GPU nodes\n\nPuhti and Mahti GPUs should only be used for workloads that greatly benefit from\nGPU capacity compared to using CPUs or which can't be run on CPUs. In particular\nAI/ML workloads are prioritized, since many of them cannot be done at all on\nCPUs. A good rule of thumb is to compare the [billing unit (BU)](../accounts/billing.md)\nusage (_e.g._ with [`seff`](../performance/#quick-start-efficiency-report-with-seff)\nor the [billing unit calculator](https://research.csc.fi/billing-units/#buc)) of the job on\nGPUs against CPUs and select the one using less.\n\nFor Puhti and Mahti, this means that a full node of CPU cores roughly equals\none GPU. However, since Puhti and Mahti have more CPU capacity than GPU, you\nmight get access to CPUs with less queuing. Note that\n[LUMI has a lot of GPU capacity](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumig/)\nwhich is also \"cheaper\" as measured in BUs, and on LUMI it's better to use GPUs if\npossible for your research. In any case, always make sure you use resources\nefficiently.\n\n## Conda installations\n\nDue to performance issues of Conda-based environments on parallel file systems,\nCSC has deprecated the _direct_ usage of Conda installations. This means that any\nConda environments you intend to use must be installed within a container. See\n[Conda best practices](../support/tutorials/conda.md) for more information.\n\n!!! info \"Tykky\"\n    Please consider the [Tykky container wrapper](containers/tykky.md) for easy\n    containerization of Conda and pip environments.\n\n## Running out of billing units\n\nIn Puhti and Mahti the users need billing units to use the services. When a\nproject runs out of billing units the ability to use the service will be\nlimited in two phases. Immediately after running out of billing units no new\njobs can be submitted. Jobs that are running are not interrupted and will run\nuntil completion/timeout. After a 30-day grace period the access to `/projappl`\nand `/scratch` folders will be disabled. No data is deleted, it is only access\nthat is disabled. Data will, however, still be removed from `/scratch` in the\n[normal cleaning process](#disk-cleaning).\n\nIf you are not using a project actively we encourage you to migrate\nany data that you still need within the 30-day grace period and then\n[close the project](../accounts/how-to-manage-your-project.md#project-closure)\nin MyCSC.\n\nIf you are still actively using the project you can gain access to the compute\nresources and storage by [applying](../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md)\nfor more billing units.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides supercomputing services for research and education, including access to login nodes, disk space management, and GPU nodes usage policies)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of CSC's supercomputers, offering CPU and GPU capacities for various workloads, including AI/ML, with specific usage and billing policies)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another supercomputer provided by CSC, similar to Puhti, with its own set of usage policies and billing units for accessing CPU and GPU resources)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer that offers significant GPU capacity, making it preferable for GPU-intensive tasks, with a different billing unit system compared to Puhti and Mahti)##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tykky is a container wrapper tool recommended by CSC for containerizing Conda and pip environments to address performance issues on parallel file systems)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>CSC manages Puhti and sets its usage and billing policies<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MAHTI<|>CSC manages Mahti and sets its usage and billing policies<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>LUMI<|>CSC recommends using LUMI for GPU-intensive tasks due to its significant GPU capacity and billing advantages<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>TYKKY<|>CSC recommends Tykky for containerizing Conda environments to improve performance on its supercomputers<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>MAHTI<|>Puhti and Mahti are both managed by CSC and share similar usage policies, though they may have different capacities<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>LUMI<|>Puhti and LUMI are both part of CSC's supercomputing resources, but LUMI is preferred for GPU-intensive tasks<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>LUMI<|>Mahti and LUMI are both part of CSC's supercomputing resources, but LUMI is preferred for GPU-intensive tasks<|>6)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
