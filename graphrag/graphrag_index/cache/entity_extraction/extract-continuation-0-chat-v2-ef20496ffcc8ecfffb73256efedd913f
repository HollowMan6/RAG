Disk areas\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/disk-areas/disk-areas-tutorial-fastdisks.html\n---\n\n# Fast disk areas in CSC's computing environment\n\n> Upon completion of this tutorial, you will be familiar with ideal disk areas for I/O intensive workloads, i.e. frequent read and write operations\n\n## Perform a light-weight pre-processing of data files using fast local disk\n\n💬 You may sometimes come across situations where you have to process a large number of smaller files, which can cause heavy input/output load on the shared file system used in CSC's computing environment.\n\n💬 In order to facilitate such heavy I/O operations, CSC provides fast local disk areas on the login and compute nodes (excluding Mahti CPU nodes).\n\n1. Identify the fast local disk areas on the login nodes with the following command:\n\n```bash\necho $TMPDIR\n```\n\n💡 The local disk area on the login nodes is meant for light-weight pre-processing of data and I/O intensive tasks such as software compilation. Actual computations should be submitted to the batch queue from the `/scratch` disk.\n\n💡 The local disk area on the login nodes are meant for temporary use and cleaned often, so make sure to move important data to `/scratch` or `/projappl` once you do not need the fast disk anymore. Note that e local disk is specific to a particular node, i.e. you cannot access the local disk of `puhti-login11` from `puhti-login12`.\n\n### Download a tar archive containing thousands of small files and merge the files into one large file using the fast local disk\n\n1. Download a tar file from the **Allas** object storage directly to the local disk:\n  \n```bash\ncd $TMPDIR           \nwget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/Individual_files.tar.gz\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Unpack the downloaded tar file:\n\n```bash\ntar -xavf Individual_files.tar.gz\ncd Individual_files\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Merge each small file into a larger one and remove all small files\n\n```bash\nfind . -name 'individual.fasta*' | xargs cat >> Merged.fasta\nfind . -name 'individual.fasta*' | xargs rm\n```\n\n☝🏻 If you intend to perform heavy computing tasks using a large number of small files, you have to use the fast local disk areas on the *compute nodes* instead of the login nodes. The compute nodes are accessed either [interactively](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/) or using [batch jobs](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti).\n\n- **In an interactive session**, use the following commands to show the local storage area on that compute node (only on Puhti):\n\n```bash\necho $LOCAL_SCRATCH\necho $TMPDIR\n```\n\n- When using batch jobs, use the environment variable `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` in your [batch job scripts](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/#local-storage) to access the local storage on that node (only on Puhti).\n\n### Move your pre-processed data to the project-specific `/scratch` area before analysis\n\n💭 Remember: the commands `csc-projects` and `csc-workspaces` reveal information about your projects.\n\n1. Create your own folder (using the environment variable `$USER`) under a project-specific directory on the `/scratch` disk (or skip this step if you already created the folder in a previous tutorial).\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER/    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Move your pre-processed data from the previous step (i.e., the `Merged.fasta` file) from the fast disk to `/scratch`:\n\n```bash\nmv Merged.fasta /scratch/<project>/$USER\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. You have now successfully moved your data to the `/scratch` area and can start performing actual analysis using batch job scripts\n\n- More about batch jobs in later tutorials.\n\n## More information\n\n💡 Hint: You can use your folder under `/scratch` for the rest of the tutorials. You can save the path using an [alias](https://www.shell-tips.com/bash/alias/) (with `cd` or `echo`) or somewhere in your notes.\n\n💡 It is sometimes required to export the paths of the `/scratch` or `/projappl` directories in environmental variables (until logout). This can be done with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nexport PROJAPPL=/projappl/<project>/   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\nexport SCRATCH=/scratch/<project>/   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides computing environment, including fast local disk areas for I/O intensive workloads and shared file systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI CPU NODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Excluded from the provision of fast local disk areas in CSC's computing environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Object storage service from which a tar archive can be downloaded directly to the local disk in CSC's computing environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Compute nodes in CSC's computing environment where local storage area can be accessed and used for heavy computing tasks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MAHTI CPU NODES<|>Mahti CPU nodes are part of CSC's computing environment but are excluded from having fast local disk areas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>ALLAS<|>Allas object storage is used within CSC's computing environment for downloading data directly to local disk areas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti compute nodes are part of CSC's computing environment, providing local storage areas for heavy computing tasks<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
