Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

There are two ways to use the\nprofiler. Within the code (or from the interpreter):\n\n```\nimport cProfile\ncProfile.run('functba(list_parameters)')\n```\n\nNow the script can be ran as a normal Python job. This will give information\nabout how long and how many times the function gets called.\n\nAlternatively cProfile can also be invoked as a script to profile another\nscript:\n\n```\npython -m cProfile [-o output_file] [-s sort_order] myscript.py\n```\n\nThe results can be printed out or saved to a file. By default they are ordered\nby name, but other options are available, too.\n\nA report saved in a file can e.g. be visualized and interpreted by a\ngraphical tool such as `pyprof2calltree`. Here is an example of a profiling\ndone for a function:\n\n```\n93 function calls in 0.065 seconds\n\n   Ordered by: standard name\n\n   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.065    0.065 <string>:1(<module>)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.028    0.028 _numpy_fft.py:1086(irfftn)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.003    0.003 arraypad.py:102(_do_append)\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 arraypad.py:107(_prepend_const)\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.004    0.002 arraypad.py:136(_append_const)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.008    0.008 arraypad.py:964(pad)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.065    0.065 compute_correlations.py:4(compute_correlations)\n        1    0.032    0.032    0.065    0.065 normxcorr2.py:33(normxcorr2)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.065    0.065 {built-in method builtins.exec}\n        1    0.003    0.003    0.003    0.003 {built-in method numpy.concatenate}\n        2    0.002    0.001    0.002    0.001 {built-in method numpy.copyto}\n        1    0.002    0.002    0.002    0.002 {built-in method numpy.where}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method numpy.zeros}\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'astype' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects}\n        2    0.003    0.002    0.003    0.002 {method 'copy' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects}\n        1    0.020    0.020    0.028    0.028 {mkl_fft._pydfti.irfftn_numpy}\n```\n\nKeep in mind that running the profiler has to be done in the same way as\nrunning a ([puhti](running/example-job-scripts-puhti.md)  or [mahti](running/example-job-scripts-mahti.md)) batch or\n[interactive](running/interactive-usage.md) job.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
