Containers and Apptainer\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/singularity/singularity-tutorial_part2.html\n---\n\n# Apptainer tutorial, part 2\n\n## Using files\n\n💬 Apptainer containers have their own internal file system that is separated\nfrom the host file system.\n\n- The internal file system is always read-only when the container is run with\n  normal user privileges.\n\n💭 In most real use cases you might want to access the host file system to read\nand write files.\n\n- To do this, you must bind a writable directory on the host file system to the\n- internal file system of the container.\n\n💡 This is done using the command line argument `--bind` (or `-B`). The basic\nsyntax is `--bind /path/inside/host:/path/inside/container`.\n\n💭 Some remarks:  \n- The bind path does not need to exist inside the container – it is created if\n  necessary.  \n- More than one bind pair can be specified.  \n- The option is available for all run methods described in the previous\n  tutorial.  \n\n1. To run these exercises on Puhti, use `sinteractive` or open a compute node\n   shell in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi):\n\n   ```bash\n   sinteractive --account <project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n2. Try listing the contents of your project directory (edit the path as needed)\n   from inside the container without `--bind`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export SCRATCH=/scratch/<project>/$USER  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   apptainer exec tutorial.sif ls $SCRATCH\n   ```\n\n3. The container cannot see the host directory, so you will get a\n   `No such file or directory` error.\n4. Try binding the host directory `/scratch` to the directory `/scratch` inside\n   the container:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer exec --bind $SCRATCH:/scratch tutorial.sif ls /scratch\n   # or\n   apptainer exec --bind /scratch:/scratch tutorial.sif ls $SCRATCH\n   ```\n\n5. This time, the host directory is linked to the container directory and the\n   command shows what the container sees inside `/scratch`.\n\n   💡 You can use `--bind` to set the container, for example, to find input\n   data or configuration files from a certain directory.\n\n6. Bind the host directory specified in `$SCRATCH` to a directory called\n   `/input`:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer exec --bind $SCRATCH:/input tutorial.sif ls /input\n   ```\n\n### Using the `apptainer_wrapper` script\n\n1. If you use the wrapper script `apptainer_wrapper`, it will automatically\n   take care of the most common bind use cases.\n2. You just need to set a `$SING_IMAGE` environment variable to point to the\n   correct Apptainer image file:\n\n   ```bash\n   export SING_IMAGE=$PWD/tutorial.sif\n   apptainer_wrapper exec ls $SCRATCH\n   ```\n\n   💡 Note that the image file name is not needed in the `apptainer_wrapper`\n   command since `$SING_IMAGE` is set.\n\n   ‼️ Since some modules set `$SING_IMAGE` when loaded, it is a good idea to\n   start with `module purge` to make sure the correct image is used if you plan\n   to use `apptainer_wrapper`.\n\n## Environment variables\n\n💬 Some software may require environment variables to be set, e.g., to point to\nsome reference data or a configuration file.\n\n💬 Most environment variables set on the host are inherited by the container.\n\n☝🏻 Sometimes this may be undesired, in which case the command line option\n`--cleanenv` can be used to prevent the host environment from being inherited\nby the container.\n\n💬 To set an environment variable specifically inside the container, you can\nset an environment variable `$APPTAINERENV_XXX` (where `XXX` is the variable\nname) on the host before invoking the container.\n\n1. Set some test variables:\n\n   ```bash\n   export TEST1=\"value1\"\n   export APPTAINERENV_TEST2=\"value2\"\n   ```\n\n2. Compare the outputs of:\n\n   ```bash\n   env | grep TEST\n   apptainer exec tutorial.sif env | grep TEST\n   apptainer exec --cleanenv tutorial.sif env | grep TEST\n   ```\n\n   - The first command is run on the host and we see `$TEST1` and\n     `$APPTAINERENV_TEST2`.\n   - The second command is run inside the container and we see `$TEST1`\n     (inherited from the host) and `$TEST2` (specifically set inside the\n     container by setting `$APPTAINERENV_TEST2` on the host).\n   - The third command is also run inside the container, but this time we\n     omitted the host environment variables so we only see `$TEST2`.\n\n1. Note that any command-line variables on the host are substituted by their\n   values when passed to the container:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer exec tutorial.sif echo $TEST1\n   apptainer exec tutorial.sif echo $TEST2\n   ```\n\n   - The first line prints the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
