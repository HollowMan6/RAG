RDM covers the whole life-cycle of data from data creation or collecting, to managing and organizing data during the project, publishing and digital preservation after the active phase of a project. Its purpose is to ensure the reproducibility of research, which is the fundamental prerequisite of all scientific research. Good data management throughout the data life-cycle is crucial for facilitating data sharing and ensuring the sustainability and accessibility of data in the long-term and therefore their re-use for future science.\n\n!!! note \"FAIR principles\"\n    According to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), the data should be \n    \n    - Findable\n    - Accessible\n    - Interoperable\n    - Re-usable\n    \n    [Get to know the principles with this video](https://youtu.be/K-kEvfaUJdA)\n   \n   \n## Best practices\n\nBelow are some guidelines for good data management practices. By browsing the data management pages, you can find instructions for example for \nchoosing data formats, licensing, persistent identifiers and handling sensitive data.\n\n![Checklist for data management planning](../../img/Checklist_for_DMP_v1.png \"Checklist for how to be successful in data management planning\")\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n \n### Maintain a data management plan\n\nMake a clear plan for managing your data. A data management plan (DMP for short) is a document that describes how you will treat your data during a project and what happens with the data after the project ends. It should cover all stages of data life cycle from discovery, collection, organization, use, to data sharing and preservation. Most funding agencies require a data management plan when funding has been granted, and the DMP should be seen as a quality assurance tool that helps to ensure the reproducibility of your research as well as the interoperability and reusability of the data.\n\n### Keep raw data raw\n\nData should be kept in its raw form whenever possible to enable transparency and facilitate reanalysis. It also assists in combining multiple data sources. It might be worthwhile to provide both unprocessed and processed versions of your data, with either code or explanations for deriving the latter.\n\n### Create analysis-friendly data\n\nTo take full advantage of data, it should be structured in a way that makes use, interpretation and analysis easy. Considering what data you will need to use, when and how, helps you in creating analysis-friendly data, for you and potentially for others. One possible structure stores each variable as a column, each observation as a row and each type of observational unit as a table.\n\n### Perform quality control\n\nData, just like other research outputs, should undergo some level of quality control. Quality control makes it easier to analyse your own data and is vital if you intend to share your data with others. You can start with some basic sanity checks, e.g. verifying there are no non-numeric values in otherwise numeric data and checking consistency in the units of measurement and naming schemes.\n\n### Use standard, open data formats\n\nEvery researcher has their own favorite tools for storing and analysing data. To make your data easy to use it is best to store it in a standard and open [file format](metadata-and-documentation.md#files-and-file-formats) which can be used by various software and remains accessible over time (e.g. CSV, XML). These types of data formats are also good candidates for the digital preservation of data.\n\n### Use good variable names and null values\n\nBe consistent when naming variables and record enough information in order to make the definitions of both the variables and their values clear. Follow the practices within your research community for naming variables e.g. using full taxonomic names. Many datasets also contain missing or empty data values which should be carefully marked (e.g. NaN) so they are distinguishable from true zeros.\n\n### Document your data processing\n\nRemember to record and report how your research data is analysed and processed. This is essential for both reproducibility and assessment of research quality. Lack of good [data documentation](metadata-and-documentation.md#data-documentation-also-called-detailed-descriptive-metadata-or-data-level-metadata) often leads to data loss. To keep [data and documentation well-organized](metadata-and-documentation.md#data-organization) you should also have a version control (manual or automatic) system in use. \n\n### Reproducibility\n\nReproducibility is an important part of providing evidence of the correctness of research results. Other researchers should be able to inspect the workflow and evaluate all of the steps that have been taken during the analysis and repeat them. Reproducibility is defined as the possibility to obtain consistent results using the same data and code as the original study (computational reproducibility). Replicability means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question using new data or other new computational methods. In this case new data is collected or created. [Documenting and sharing](metadata-and-documentation.md#versioning) research software and workflows are crucial elements of reproducibility.\n\n### Provide metadata\n\n[Metadata](metadata-and-documentation.md#metadata-types) is contextual information about the data and its provenance, necessary for interpreting the data. Providing metadata enables you, and others interested in extending your work, to return to it later. Providing comprehensive metadata according to your discipline's conventions makes your data discoverable and reusable.\n\n### Get identifiers for your data\n\nData used in research and publications should be uniquely identifiable. Make sure the data repository you use provides your data with a [persistent identifier](publishing-datasets.md#persistent-identifiers) (e.g. DOI, URN). Use your dataset's identifier when sharing it and using it so it collects data citations for you.\n\n### Take care of storage\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
