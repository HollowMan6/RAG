Containers and Apptainer\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 5\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/singularity/singularity_extra_replicating-conda.html\n---\n\n# Replicating a Conda environment in a container\n\nðŸ’¬ On CSC supercomputers you can use\n[Tykky](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/) to easily containerize\nConda environments. This method is recommended over the manual procedure\ndetailed in this exercise, which is mainly provided for you to develop your\nskills in working with containers. For tutorials on using Tykky, see:\n\n- [Containerizing a Conda environment with Tykky](../installing/python.md)\n- [Installing packages from Bioconda using Tykky](../../part-1/modules/modules-bio.md)\n\n## Conda\n\nðŸ’¬ Conda is a useful tool for installing software with complex dependencies. It\nhas, however, some problems, especially on HPC systems like Puhti with shared\nparallel file systems. Because of these issues, installing Conda environments\ndirectly on the file system of CSC supercomputers is\n[not allowed](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/#conda-installations).\n\nðŸ’¬ The main problems of Conda environments are related to storage. Conda\nenvironments are large, containing tens to hundreds of thousands of files. Just\n3-4 environments are enough to fill the basic quota of a project's `/projappl`\ndirectory. Moreover, many of these files will be accessed each time you launch\na program installed with Conda, generating massive I/O load which may degrade\nthe performance of the file system for all users.\n\nðŸ’¬ Conda environments can also be somewhat sensitive to changes in the base\nsystem, meaning that e.g. system updates can sometimes break existing Conda\nenvironments, necessitating a reinstall.\n\nðŸ’¬ Using an Apptainer container can help with both problems. A container is\njust a single file that is typically smaller than the total size of the Conda\nenvironment directory. It is also less sensitive to changes in the host system.\nIt is also relatively easy to containerize an existing Conda environment.\n\n## Check for ready containers\n\nðŸ’¬ You should first check if the software package is already available as an\nApptainer/Singularity or Docker container. The advantage of a ready-made\ncontainer is that it can usually be pulled/converted with normal user\nprivileges on Puhti.\n\nYou can find more detailed instructions on converting Docker containers in\n[Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/creating/#converting-a-docker-container).\n\n## Replicating an existing Conda environment\n\nIf you have an existing Conda environment, you can save the `environment.yml`\nfile and use it to replicate the environment in a container.\n\nPlease note that the `environment.yml` file will only reflect changes to the\nenvironment made using `conda` commands. If you have made any changes directly,\nyou will need to replicate those changes in the definition file.\n\n1. Make sure the environment you want to replicate is activated, and give the\n   command:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda env export > environment.yml\n   ```\n\n2. You can try with one of your own environments, or download an example to use\n   for this exercise:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/environment.yml\n   ```\n\n3. In addition to the `environment.yml` file, you will need an Apptainer\n   definition file. Create a file called `conda_environment.def` with the\n   following content (copy/paste).\n\n   ```text\n   Bootstrap: docker\n   From: continuumio/miniconda3\n   \n   %files\n       environment.yml\n   \n   %environment\n   \n   %post\n       ENV_NAME=$(head -1 environment.yml | cut -d' ' -f2)\n       echo \". /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" >> $APPTAINER_ENVIRONMENT\n       echo \"conda activate $ENV_NAME\" >> $APPTAINER_ENVIRONMENT\n   \n       . /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\n       conda env create -f environment.yml -p /opt/conda/envs/$ENV_NAME\n       conda clean --all\n   \n   %runscript\n       exec \"$@\"\n   ```\n\n4. Make sure the files `environment.yml` and `conda_environment.def` are in the\n   current directory and give the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer build --fakeroot fastx.sif conda_environment.def\n   ```\n\n5. This will build an Apptainer image file called `fastx.sif`. We can now\n   verify that it works:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer exec fastx.sif fastq_to_fasta -h\n   ```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
