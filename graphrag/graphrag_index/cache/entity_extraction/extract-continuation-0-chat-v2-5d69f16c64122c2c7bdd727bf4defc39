However, as there \nare nearly 20 000 libraries in the CRAN repository and over 2000 libraries in the Bioconductor \nrepository, it is quite common that some library that you would like to use is not included in the default selection.\n\nThis document describes the usage of help tools that you can use to add RStudio 4.2.2 and missing R libraries to your SD Desktop environment. \nThe process described here is the first prototype implementation of this service and it is likely the change in the future.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to get access to the installation tool, you need to **send a request to [CSC Service desk](/support/contact/)**.\nIn the request, indicate that you wish that the SD Desktop software installation help tools would be made available for your project. \nYou must also include to the message the **Project identifier string** of your project.\n\nYou can check this random string for example in the [SD Connect service](https://sd-connect.csc.fi). There you find the \nProject Identifier in the **User information** view. \n\n## Installing RStudio 4.2.2\n\nLog in to your SD Desktop and open **Data Gateway**. If the software installation help tools are enabled for your project, then you should have folder: \n`tools-for-sd-desktop` included in the directory that Data Gateway created (in `Projects/SD Connect/your-project-name`).\nOpen `tools-for-sd-desktop` folder and from there, drag/copy file `sd-installer.desktop` to your desktop.\n\n[![Installing-sd-installer](/data/sensitive-data/images/desktop/sd-installer1.png)](/data/sensitive-data/images/desktop/sd-installer1.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** Copying `sd-installer.desktop` file to SD desktop.\n \nDouble click the copy of `sd-installer.desktop` to start the software installation tool. Use this tool to install _RStudio 4.2.2_ \nto your SD Desktop virtual machine if you have not yet done so. The installation takes several minutes. \n\n[![sd-installer](/data/sensitive-data/images/desktop/sd-installer2.png)](/data/sensitive-data/images/desktop/sd-installer2.png)\n\n**Figure 2.** SD software installation tool.\n\nOnce the installation is done you can start RStudio by clicking the RStudio icon in the desktop or by executing command:\n\n```text\nstart-rstudio\n```\n\n## Adding missing R libraries\n\nOnce the RStudio environment is installed, new libraries can be added by opening a terminal and executing command:\n\n```text\nadd-R-library \n```\n\nThe command asks for a search term and shows the available R libraries that match the search string. \nIf several libraries are found, you will be provided an enumerated list from which you can\nselect the library that should be installed.\n\nThis tool does not check for internal library dependencies, and quite often the first installation attempt fails. \nIn these cases you should check the names of the missing libraries and install them first.\n\nFor example, search term _fusion_ finds 8 libraries. In this case we want to install _DNAfusion_ (`DNAfusion_1.0.0.tar.gz`), \nthat is listed as the first in the list, so the installation is started by pressing _1_ and then _Enter_.\n\nIn this case, the installation however fails as DNAfusion depends on a library which is not yet installed. \nIn this kind of situations you need to check the names of the missing libraries from the error message and install them first. \nYou can give the name of the library as an argument to the add-R-library command. \nFor example in this case the missing library, _bamsignals_, can be added with command:\n\n```text\nadd-R-library bamsignals\n```\n\nAfter which you can install DNAfusion\n\n```text\nadd-R-library DNAfusion\n```\n\nThe additional libraries are installed to location `/shared-directory/sd-toold/apps/R/lib` where they are available for\nall the users of the virtual machine. This is not a default location of R libraries so you must define the location in your \nR code with command:\n\n```text\n.libPaths(”/shared-directory/sd-tools/apps/R/lib/”)\n```\n\nAfter that you can take the library in use. e.g.\n\n```text\nlibrary(DNAfusion)\n```\n# Adding RStudio and R libraries to SD Desktop\n\nUsing R and RStudio in SD Desktop virtual machines is based on an Apptainer/Singularity container that \ncontains R and RStudio installations and over 1000 commonly used R libraries.
