It\nwill perform a rolling update to kill all pods one by one and replace them with\nnewer ones while making sure that end user traffic is directed towards working\npods at all times.\n\n![Deployment](../img/deployment.png)\n\n*`deployment.yaml`*:\n```yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: deployment-name\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: deployment-name\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: deployment-labels\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: pod\n        image: <your_image>\n      volumeMounts:\n      - mountPath: /path/to/folder/\n        name: pvc\n      ports:\n      - containerPort: xx\n        protocol: TCP\n      volumes:\n      - name: vol\n        persistentVolumeClaim:\n          claimName: pvc\n```\n\n### InitContainer\n\n_InitContainer_ is a container in a pod that is intended run to completion before\nthe main containers are started. Data from the init containers can be\ntransferred to the main container using e.g. empty volume mounts.\n\n*`pod-init.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mypod\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n    pool: servepod\nspec:\n  volumes:\n  - name: sharevol\n    emptyDir: {}\n  initContainers:\n  - name: perlhelper\n    image: perl\n    command:\n    - sh\n    - -c\n    - >\n      echo Hello from perl helper > /datavol/index.html\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: /datavol\n      name: sharevol\n  containers:\n  - name: serve-cont\n    image: docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: /var/www/html\n      name: sharevol\n```\n\nHere we run an init container that uses the `perl` image and writes text\nin the `index.html` file on the shared volume.\n\nThe shared volume is defined in `spec.volumes` and \"mounted\" in\n`spec.initContainers.volumeMounts` and `spec.containers.volumeMounts`.\n\n### StatefulSet\n\nMost Kubernetes objects are stateless. This means that they may be deleted and recreated, and the application should be able to cope with that without any visible effect. For example, a Deployment defines a Pod with 5 replicas and a Rolling release strategy. When a new image is deployed, Kubernetes will kill one by one all Pods, recreating them with different names and possibly in different nodes, always keeping at least 5 replicas active. For some application this is not acceptable, for this use case, Stateful sets have been created.\n\nLike a Deployment, a StatefulSet defines Pods based on container specification. But unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet gives an expected and stable identity, with a persistent identifier that it is maintained across any event (upgrades, re-deployments, ...). A stateful set provides:\n\n* Stable, unique network identifiers.\n* Stable, persistent storage.\n* Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.\n* Ordered, automated rolling updates.\n\n*`statefulSet.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n  name: web\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx # has to match .spec.template.metadata.labels\n  serviceName: \"nginx\"\n  replicas: 3 # If omitted, by default is 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx # has to match .spec.selector.matchLabels\n    spec:\n      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: openshift/hello-openshift\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 8888\n          name: web\n        volumeMounts:\n        - name: www\n          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\n  volumeClaimTemplates:\n  - metadata:\n      name: www\n    spec:\n      accessModes: [ \"ReadWriteOnce\" ]\n      storageClassName: \"standard-rwo\"\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 1Gi\n```\n\n### Jobs\n\n_Jobs_ are run-to-completion pods, except that they operate on the same level\nas ReplicationControllers, in the sense that they too define the template for the pod\nto be launched instead of directly describing the pod. The difference is,\nhowever, that *jobs* are not restarted when they finish.\n\n*`job.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: Job\nmetadata:\n  name: pi\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      volumes:\n      - name: smalldisk-vol\n        emptyDir: {}\n      containers:\n      - name: pi\n        image: perl\n        command:\n        - sh\n        - -c\n        - >\n          echo helloing so much here!
