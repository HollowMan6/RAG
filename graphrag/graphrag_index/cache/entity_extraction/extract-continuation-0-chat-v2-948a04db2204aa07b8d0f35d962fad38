instructions for [Installing OpenStack and other required Python libraries](../../../cloud/pouta/install-client.md).\n\nDownload the **OpenStack RC File v3** as instructed in the last section [*Configure your terminal environment for OpenStack*](../../../cloud/pouta/install-client.md#configure-your-terminal-environment-for-openstack).\n\nThe **Python pip libraries** required in the examples:  \n *python-keystoneclient* and *python-swiftclient*.\n\nThis page includes Python scripts for the following operations:\n\n| Function |\n| :--- |\n| Create a connection to server |\n| Create a bucket |\n| Upload an object |\n| List buckets and objects |\n| Download an object |\n| Remove buckets and objects |\n\n## Create a connection\n\nThis Python script creates a connection to the server:\n```python\nfrom keystoneauth1 import session\nfrom keystoneauth1.identity import v3\nimport os\nimport swiftclient\nfrom swiftclient.multithreading import OutputManager\nfrom swiftclient.service import SwiftError, SwiftService, SwiftUploadObject\n\n\n_authurl = os.environ['OS_AUTH_URL']\n_auth_version = os.environ['OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION']\n_user = os.environ['OS_USERNAME']\n_key = os.environ['OS_PASSWORD']\n_os_options = {\n    'user_domain_name': os.environ['OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME'],\n    'project_domain_name': os.environ['OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME'],\n    'project_name': os.environ['OS_PROJECT_NAME']\n}\n\nconn = swiftclient.Connection(\n    authurl=_authurl,\n    user=_user,\n    key=_key,\n    os_options=_os_options,\n    auth_version=_auth_version\n)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can enter the information directly in the script from the downloaded RC file:\n\n```python\nimport swiftclient\n\n_authurl = 'https://pouta.csc.fi:5001/v3'\n_auth_version = '3'\n_user = 'John'\n_key = 'John1234'\n_os_options = {\n    'user_domain_name': 'Default',\n    'project_domain_name': 'Default',\n    'project_name': 'project_123456'\n}\n\nconn = swiftclient.Connection(\n    authurl=_authurl,\n    user=_user,\n    key=_key,\n    os_options=_os_options,\n    auth_version=_auth_version\n)\n```\n  \nIn the above example:\n\n| | | |\n|-|-|-|\n| OS_AUTH_URL | = _authurl | = *https://pouta.csc.fi:5001/v3*  |\n| OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION | = _auth_version | = *3*  |\n| OS_USERNAME | = _user | = *John*  |\n| OS_PASSWORD | = _key | = *John1234* |  \n| OS_PROJECT_NAME | = project_name | = *project_123456* |\n\nFurther information of the _Keystone authentication_:  \n[https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/newton/client-api.html](https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/newton/client-api.html) \n\n## Create a bucket\n\nCreate a new bucket using the following script:\n\n```python\nbucket_name='snakebucket'\nconn.put_container(bucket_name)\n```\n\n## Upload an object\n\nUpload a small file called `my_snake.txt` to the bucket `snakebucket`:\n\n```python\nobject_name='my_snake.txt'\nwith open(object_name, 'r') as f:\n    conn.put_object(bucket_name, object_name,\n                    contents=f.read(),\n                    content_type='text/plain')\n```\nThe upload process above works only for files that are smaller than 5 GB. \nIn the case of larger files, you should use _SwiftService_.\n\n```python\nobject_list = [ 'my_snake.txt' ]\n# limit upload threads to 4\nopts = {'object_uu_threads': 4}\n\nwith SwiftService(options=opts) as swift:\n    try:\n        for r in swift.upload(bucket_name, object_list, { 'segment_size': 5000000000, }):\n            if r['success']:\n                if 'object' in r:\n                    print(r['object'])\n                elif 'for_object' in r:\n                    print(\n                        '%s segment %s' % (r['for_object'],\n                            r['segment_index'])\n                         )\n            else:\n                print(r)\n\n    except SwiftError as e:\n        print(e.value)\n```\n\n\n\n## List buckets and objects\n\nList all buckets belonging to a project:\n```python\nresp_headers, containers = conn.get_account()\n\nfor container in containers:\n   print(container)\n```\n\nAnd all objects belonging to a bucket:\n```python\nfor info in conn.get_container('snakebucket')[1]:\n    print('{0}\\t{1}\\t{2}'.format(info['name'], info['bytes'], info['last_modified']))\n```\n\n## Download an object\n\nDownload an object:\n```python\nmy_obj = conn.get_object(bucket_name, object_name)[1]\nwith open('new_name_for_file.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(my_obj)\n```\n\n**Please note:** If you get the error\n```python\nTypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes\n```\nopen the file in the binary mode\n```python\nwith open('new_name_for_file.txt', 'bw') as f:\n    f.write(my_obj)\n```\ninstead of the text mode.\n\n\n## Remove buckets and objects\n\nDelete a bucket:\n```python\nconn.delete_container(bucket_name)\n```\n\n**Note:** Only empty buckets can be removed.\n\nRemove an object:\n```python\nconn.delete_object(bucket_name, 'my_snake.txt')\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides instructions for installing OpenStack and other required
