This option is called `--sort-by-size` and always\nsorts in a decending order (i.e., biggest files first). If you want to see the size of the files\nwhen they are printed, use the `--csv` option. By default, only the file paths are printed.\nYou can also limit the output to include a given number of files with the `--limit N` parameter,\nwhere `N` is the number of lines you want to see.\n\n```bash\n# Print the file paths to be purged in size order:\nlcleaner --sort-by-size \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n\n# Print the 10 biggest files:\nlcleaner --sort-by-size --limit 10 \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n\n# Print the 10 biggest files, and their sizes in bytes:\nlcleaner --sort-by-size --limit 10 --csv \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n```\n\n#### Delete your purge list files\n\nWe encourage you to delete the files you do not need, instead of waiting for the automatic cleaning\nto take place. If you are happy with purging all of the files that were listed in the\n`path_summary.txt` file, you can run the following command:\n\n!!! warning-label\n    **The commands in this section will delete your files!** Be sure that you have reviewed the\n    list of files to remove carefully! Also make sure that you have backed up the files you\n    wish to save (outside the cluster) prior to running the commands. This operation is\n    irreversible.\n\n!!! Note\n    The deletion process may take a considerable amount of time (several hours, depending on the\n    amount of files), so it is best to start it within a `screen` or `tmux` session, so that you\n    can disconnect from your SSH session while the deletion keeps running.\n\n```bash\n# Start a screen session\nscreen\n# Delete all of the files on your purge list:\n# Replace the \"/path/to/my/path_summary.txt\" with the path to your project's path_summary.txt\nlcleaner -0 /path/to/my/path_summary.txt | xargs -0 -n 50 rm -vf --\n# Then you can press \"Ctrl + a\" and then \"d\" to disconnect from the screen and keep\n# the deletion running in the background.\n# Run \"screen -r\" to reattach your screen.\n# Close the screen session by typing \"exit\" in the shell.\n```\n\nIf you want to delete only a part of the files, e.g., inside a certain directory, you can for\nexample use a command like this:\n\n```bash\n# Delete only files on the list which are inside /scratch/$my_project/delete-this-dir/\nscreen lcleaner -0 /path/to/my/path_summary.txt | grep -zZ \"/scratch/${my_project:?}/delete-this-dir/\" | xargs -0 -n 50 rm -vf --\n# Ctrl + a, d to detach from the screen.\n```\n\n#### LCleaner output formats\n\nIf you want to see the size of the files that are about to be purged, you can use either the JSON\nor the CSV formats. Be aware that if you want to run multiple output formats at the same time,\nyou need to specify an output file path as well.\nUsing the `-0` or `--nullbyte` parameters will output the file paths separated by a null byte,\nwhich may be useful to avoid problems with whitespace in the file paths.\n\n```bash\n# Print your purge list as CSV output with file paths and sizes.\n# Note that the CSV format also prints a header row.\nlcleaner --csv \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n\n# Print your purge list as JSON output with file paths and sizes:\nlcleaner --json \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n# TIP: You can pipe the output into the jq program to prettify the output.\n# The dot at the end is a mandatory argument to jq.\nlcleaner --json \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\" | jq .\n\n# Output both JSON and CSV into purge_list.json and purge_list.csv:\nlcleaner --json --csv --out-file purge_list \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n\n# Output file paths separated by null bytes:\nlcleaner -0 \"/scratch/purge_lists/${\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
