Snakemake enables scalable and reproducible scientific pipelines by chaining a series of rules in a fully-specified software environment. \n\nIf you are still wondering about workflows at more general level or which workflow tool to use, see also [High-throughput computing and workflows page](../../computing/running/throughput.md).\n\n## Installation\nSnakemake is available as a module in Puhti supercomputer. This options suits well, if the workflow includes commandline-tools from other modules or Apptainer containers. If the workflow includes Python scripts that require custom Python packages, make own Snakemake installation with Tykky. \n\n### Snakemake module\nSnakemake module is the easiest option. The available version are listed on the [Snakemake app page](../../apps/snakemake.md#available).\n\n```\nmodule load snakemake\nsnakemake --help   #  to get information on more options.\n```\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Please pay attention to the version of Snakemake you are using. If you are using earlier versions of Snakemake (e.g., v7.xx.x) the syntax might be different.\n \n### Installation of tools used in the the workflow\nThe tools used in the workflow can be installed in following ways:\n\n1. Tools available in other [Puhti modules](../../apps/by_discipline.md) or [own custom module](../../computing/modules.md#using-your-own-module-files).\n    * If all Snakemake rules use the same module(s), load it before running snakemake commands.\n    * If different Snakemake rules use different modules, include the [module information in the Snakefile](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snakefiles/deployment.html#using-environment-modules).\n2. Own custom installations as Apptainer containers:\n    * Apptainer container can be downloaded from some repository or built locally. For building custom Apptainer containers, see [Creating containers page](../../computing/containers/creating.md).\n    * See Snakemake's [Running jobs in containers](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#running-jobs-in-containers) for changes required in Snakemake file and command.\n    * For binding folders or using other Apptainer flags, use [--apptainer-args option](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html#apptainer/singularity) of `snakemake` command.\n    * Sometimes it might be necessary to [define the shell inside the container](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#handling-shell-executable). \n\n```\n# If your Apptainer tutorial.sif image is stored locally in Puhti in folder \"image\":\ncontainer: \"image/tutorial.sif\"\n# If you would like to covert a Docker iamge to Apptainer container image on-the-fly:\ncontainer: \"docker://<repository>/<image_name>\"\n```\n\n### Snakemake Tykky installation for Python\nTo install Snakemake with custom Python packages, use [Tykky container wrapper tool with conda](../../computing/containers/tykky.md#conda-based-installation). Follow the guidelines on Tykky page, the conda environment should include package `snakemake`. If you plan to use Snakemake with SLURM or HyperQueue integration (explained below), install also `snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm` for SLURM or `snakemake-executor-plugin-cluster-generic` for HyperQueue. These packages are part of `bioconda` repository, so add it to the channels list in the conda environment file.\n\nFor SLURM integration, you have to also fix the Python path of Snakemake executable:\n\n* Find out your Tykky installation's Python path. You can check it with `which python` command after you have given the `export PATH ...` from Tykky printout.\n* Create a file `post.sh`. Change `/projappl/project_200xxx/tykky_installation_folder/bin/python` to your own Tykky installation's Python path.\n   \n```bash title=\"post.sh\"\nsed -i 's@#!.*@#!/projappl/project_200xxx/tykky_installation_folder/bin/python@g' $env_root/bin/snakemake\n```\n\n* Update the installation:\n   \n```\nconda-containerize update <path to installation> --post-install post.sh\n```\n\nIf you use own Tykky installation, then in the examples below, replace `module load snakemake` with the export commant printed out by Tykky, something like: `export PATH=\"/projappl/project_xxxx/$USER/snakemake_tykky/bin:$PATH\"`\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n        Please note, create one Tykky installation for the whole workflow, not individual installations for each Snakemake rule.\n\n## Usage\nSnakemake can be run in 4 different ways in supercomputers:\n\n1. [In interactive mode](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) with local executor, with limited resources. Useful mainly for debugging or very small workflows.\n2. With batch job and local executor. Resource usage limited to one full node. Useful for small and medium size workflows, simpler than next\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE WORKFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A popular scientific workflow in the bioinformatics community for scalable and reproducible scientific pipelines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supercomputer that offers Snakemake as a module for running scientific workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Container wrapper tool used for installing Snakemake with custom Python packages on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Container platform used within Snakemake workflows for custom installations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A workload manager used for submitting jobs to the supercomputer, integrated with Snakemake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A job management system that can be integrated with Snakemake for executing workflows)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE WORKFLOW<|>PUHTI<|>Snakemake is available as a module on the Puhti supercomputer for running scientific workflows<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE WORKFLOW<|>TYKKY<|>Snakemake can be installed with custom Python packages using Tykky on Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE WORKFLOW<|>APPTAINER<|>Snakemake workflows can use Apptainer containers for custom tool installations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE WORKFLOW<|>SLURM<|>Snakemake can integrate with SLURM for submitting jobs on supercomputers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE WORKFLOW<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>Snakemake can integrate with HyperQueue for managing job execution<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
