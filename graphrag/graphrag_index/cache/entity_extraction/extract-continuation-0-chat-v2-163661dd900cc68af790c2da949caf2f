Navigation functions support exploration within the Entrez databases:\n    * `esearch` performs a new Entrez search using terms in indexed fields.\n    * `elink` looks up neighbors (within a database) or links (between databases).\n    * `efilter` filters or restricts the results of a previous query.\n2. Records can be retrieved in specified formats or as document summaries:\n    * `efetch` downloads records or reports in a designated format.\n3. Desired fields from XML results can be extracted without writing a program:\n    * `xtract` converts Edirect XML output into a table of data values.\n4. Several additional functions are also provided:\n    * `einfo` obtains information on indexed fields in an Entrez database.\n    * `epost` uploads unique identifiers (UIDs) or sequence accession numbers.\n    * `nquire` sends a URL request to a web page or CGI service\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use for all users. [Public Domain notice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/#chapter6.Appendices).\n\n## Available\n\nPuhti: 13.4\n\n## Usage\n\nThe `edirect` commands listed above are activated by loading the `biokit` module.\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nAfter that you can, e.g., use `esearch` and `efetch` to retrieve protein or nucleotide sequence entries, whose annotation matches the given search terms. In search terms, you can also use wildcard character `*` to match any string. The search is case-insensitive: \"Mus\" and \"mus\" will produce the same matches. You can also focus your search to certain fields of the search database (Keywords, Author, Organism, Accession, Gene name, Protein name, Sequence length etc.). In the case of sequence length, a range should be defined with syntax `from:to`. For example: `120:125`.\n\nNormally, it is wise to first use just the `esearch` command to get an idea how many hits are found. \nFor example, search:\n\n```bash\nesearch -db nucleotide -query barc\n```\n\nwill report that 267791 hits were found.\n\n```xml\n<ENTREZ_DIRECT>\n  <Db>nucleotide</Db>\n  <WebEnv>NCID_1_7176041_130.14.18.48_9001_1567161450_1478919739_0MetA0_S_MegaStore</WebEnv>\n  <QueryKey>1</QueryKey>\n  <Count>267791</Count>\n  <Step>1</Step>\n</ENTREZ_DIRECT>\n```\n\nIn this case it might be reasonable to refine the search before the search definition is further piped to `efetch` command for the actual data retrieval. One search can include several search terms that are combined using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`). The matching sequences can be saved in several formats, for example, fasta or Genebank formats are supported. The command below retrieves just one entry, _Lyngbya majuscula_ barbamide biosynthesis gene cluster that contains gene with name _braC_.\n\n```bash\nesearch -db nucleotide -query \"barc [GENE] AND Lyngbya majuscula [ORGN]\" | efetch -format gb > barc_Lm.gb\n```\n\n## More information\n\n* [Edirect manual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ENTREZ DIRECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entrez Direct, also known as Edirect, is a toolkit for retrieving sequences and other data from NCBI sequence databases using query terms)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NCBI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Center for Biotechnology Information, which hosts sequence databases and the Edirect toolkit for data retrieval)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A location or system where Edirect is available, version 13.4 mentioned)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYNGBYA MAJUSCULA<|>GEO<|>An organism mentioned in the context of a search query example for retrieving nucleotide sequence entries)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENTREZ DIRECT<|>NCBI<|>Entrez Direct is a toolkit developed by NCBI for data retrieval from its sequence databases<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENTREZ DIRECT<|>PUHTI<|>Edirect version 13.4 is available on Puhti, indicating a deployment or usage relationship<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYNGBYA MAJUSCULA<|>ENTREZ DIRECT<|>Lyngbya majuscula is used as an example organism in a search query demonstrating the use of Entrez Direct<|>3)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
