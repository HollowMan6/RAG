The tutorial assumes basic knowledge of the Linux operating system, Git version control system, Julia language, and SQL databases. We recommend reading the Linux basics tutorial for understanding basic [Linux command line usage](../../support/tutorials/env-guide/index.md).\n\nYou can find the web application from the [csc-training/GenieWebApp.jl](https://github.com/csc-training/GenieWebApp.jl) repository. You can start by cloning the GitHub repository.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/csc-training/GenieWebApp.jl.git\n```\n\nThen, you can continue by reading the [GenieWebApp.jl's documentation](https://csc-training.github.io/GenieWebApp.jl/dev/), which contains in-depth instruction on developing and deploying the application using a web user interface and command-line interface to a virtual machine on [Pouta](../pouta/index.md) with OpenStack and OpenShift container platform on [Rahti](../rahti2/index.md). By following the instructions, you will learn the basic usage of both services.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
