Instead,\nthey allow access to such extended resources through custom device plugins which are responsible for\nhandling the advertisement and allocation setup of these extended resources.\n\nThe device plugin used in Rahti 1 handles Nvidia GPU with the resource name `nvidia.com/gpu`. More on\nhow it is used in practice later.\n\nCurrently, Rahti 1 has a very limited amount of A100/P100 GPUs. For this reason, your Rahti 1 projects\nwill not have access to GPU by default. This means you will need to request a GPU quota by sending\na request to servicedesk@csc.fi stating the Rahti 1 project/namespace you need the quota for.\n\nThe Rahti 1 GPU comes with an Nvidia driver which includes the low-level shared libraries and headers\nneeded to access/program the GPU device as well as the Nvidia device monitoring tools such as Nvidia\n-smi which are useful for gathering information on the usage of GPUs. These libraries and tools will\nbe mounted and be made available to the pod automatically by the system during its creation.\n\n## Running GPU-enabled pods\n\nAs a first example let's create a pod which runs `nvidia-smi` command line utility that is designed\nto be used for managing and monitoring NVIDIA GPU devices. This is the simplest example that can be\nused to demonstrate the availability of GPU in your Rahti 1 project.\n\nTo run the example you need to login to Rahti 1 and switch to the project that you have an approved\nGPU quota as:\n\n```bash\noc login https://rahti.csc.fi:8443 --token=<your-token>\noc project <your-project>\noc describe limitranges core-resource-limits #to check your assigned GPU qouta\n```\n\nThen create a file with the following content:\n\n```yaml\n# gpu-example-1.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: gpu-example-1\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n    - name: gpu-example-1\n      image: \"nvidia/cuda:11.6.0-base-ubi8\"\n      command: [\"nvidia-smi\"]\n      resources:\n        limits:\n          nvidia.com/gpu: 1\n```\n\nAnd run the following command to start the pod:\n```bash\noc apply -f gpu-example-1.yaml\n```\n\nFinally check the output of the execution from the pod (you might need to wait for a few seconds for\nthe pod creation to complete) and clean up after using:\n```bash\noc logs gpu-example-1\n```\n```bash\noc delete pod gpu-example-1\n```\n\nAs second example you can create a pod running Cuda based vector addition to demonstrate access to\nGPU through a lower-level programming model/interface.\n\nTo run the second example create a pod definition file as:\n\n```yaml\n# gpu-example-2.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: gpu-example-2\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: OnFailure\n  containers:\n    - name: gpu-example-2\n      # https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.7.11/test/images/nvidia-cuda/Dockerfile\n      image: \"k8s.gcr.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1\"\n      resources:\n        limits:\n          nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # requesting 1 GPU\n```\n\nAnd run, check the log (you might need to wait for a few seconds for the task to complete), and clean\nup after as:\n\n```bash\noc apply -f gpu-example-2.yaml\n```\n```bash\noc logs gpu-example-2\n```\n```bash\noc delete pod gpu-example-2\n```\n\nAs a final example, we show how a more complete system that uses GPU resources can be deployed on Rahti 1.\nThe example provides an API for training and deploying a text sentiment classification model. To\nfacilitate easier deployment, we use various Kubernetes resource definitions and their explanation\ncan be found in the general [Kubernetes basics page](../concepts/).  One of the main things to notice\nin this example is the Dockerfile that packages the application. The Dockerfile uses an appropriate\nbase image (`FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:2.7.0-gpu`) which contains the right runtime CUDA libraries\nfor utilizing the GPU resource. This image can be built locally and be pushed to an image repository\nthat can be used during the deployment of the system. A`BuildConfig` Openshift resource can also be\nused as is the case in this example.\n\nTo run the example use the following command:\n```bash\noc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cscfi/rahti-ml-examples/tf2-imdb-cuda/rahti-ml-example-cuda-template.yaml\n| oc create -f -\n```\n\nYou can then follow the deployment of the application and its components from the Rahti 1 console or\nusing `oc status`, and interact with the application using the UI at <your-application-route>/docs.\nThe route your application has been deployed to can be found from the Rahti 1 console or using `oc get routes`.\n\nAfter exploring and testing the example deployment it should be cleaned up as:\n```bash\noc delete all -l app=rahti-ml-examples\n```\n\n## Limitations\nAt the moment, it is not possible to request a fraction of GPU. At least, a single or more GPU has\nto be requested. Also, keep in mind that the GPU resources are scarce and at times your GPU request\nmight stay in a pending state until resources\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
