Download a simple program parallelized with MPI:\n\n```bash\nwget https://a3s.fi/hello_mpi.x/hello_mpi.x\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Make it executable using the command:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x hello_mpi.x\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Copy the script below into a file called `my_parallel.bash` and change `<project>` to the CSC project you actually want to use:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>      # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n#SBATCH --time=00:00:10          # Maximum duration of the job. Upper limit depends of the partition. \n#SBATCH --partition=test         # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, hugemem_longrun\n#SBATCH --nodes=2                # Number of compute nodes. Upper limit depends on partition.\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4      # How many tasks to launch per node. Depends on the number of cores and memory on a node.\n\nsrun hello_mpi.x\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Submit the job to queue with the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch my_parallel.bash\n```\n\nðŸ’¬ In the batch job example above we are requesting\n\n- resources from two nodes (`--nodes=2`)\n- four cores from each node (`--ntasks-per-node=4`)\n- for ten seconds (`--time=00:00:10`)\n- from the test queue (`--partition=test`)\n\nðŸ’¬ We want to run the program `hello_mpi.x` that will, based on the resource request, start 8 simultaneous tasks\n\nðŸ’¬ Each of the 8 tasks launched by `hello_mpi.x` will report their number and on which node they ran\n\n#### Check the output and the efficiency\n\nðŸ’¬ When finished, the output file `slurm-<jobid>.out` will contain the results from the `hello_mpi.x` program on how the 8 tasks were distributed over the two reserved nodes\n\n1. Check the output with:\n\n```bash\ncat slurm-<jobid>.out    # replace <jobid> with the actual Slurm job ID\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. The output should look something like this:\n\n```bash\nHello world from node r07c01.bullx, rank 0 out of 8 tasks\nHello world from node r07c02.bullx, rank 5 out of 8 tasks\nHello world from node r07c02.bullx, rank 7 out of 8 tasks\nHello world from node r07c01.bullx, rank 2 out of 8 tasks\nHello world from node r07c02.bullx, rank 4 out of 8 tasks\nHello world from node r07c01.bullx, rank 3 out of 8 tasks\nHello world from node r07c01.bullx, rank 1 out of 8 tasks\nHello world from node r07c02.bullx, rank 6 out of 8 tasks\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. The output above verifies that the requested 8 tasks were distributed over two nodes (`r07c01.bullx, r07c02.bullx`), four tasks on each\n4. Check the efficiency of the job compared to the reserved resources by issuing the command `seff <jobid>` (replace `<jobid>` with the actual Slurm job ID)\n\nðŸ—¯ **Note!** This example asks 4 cores from each of the 2 nodes. Normally, this would not make sense, and instead it would be better to run all 8 cores in the same node (in Puhti one node has 40 cores!). Typically, you want your resources (cores) to be spread on as few nodes as possible to avoid unnecessary communication between nodes.\n\n## More information\n\nðŸ’¡ [FAQ on CSC batch jobs](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/#batch-jobs) in Docs CSC\n\nðŸ’­ You can get a list of all your jobs that are running or queuing with the command `squeue -u $USER`\n\nðŸ’­ A submitted job can be cancelled using the command `scancel <jobid>`\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HELLO_MPI.X<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A simple program parallelized with MPI for demonstrating distributed computing across multiple nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY_PARALLEL.BASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A script used to submit a job to a computing cluster, specifying resources and tasks for parallel execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R07C01.BULLX<|>GEO<|>One of the compute nodes on which the MPI program hello_mpi.x ran tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R07C02.BULLX<|>GEO<|>Another compute node on which the MPI program hello_mpi.x ran tasks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELLO_MPI.X<|>MY_PARALLEL.BASH<|>The hello_mpi.x program is executed by the my_parallel.bash script in a distributed computing environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R07C01.BULLX<|>HELLO_MPI.X<|>The hello_mpi.x program ran tasks on the compute node r07c01.bullx<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R07C02.BULLX<|>HELLO_MPI.X<|>The hello_mpi.x program ran tasks on the compute node r07c02.bullx<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
