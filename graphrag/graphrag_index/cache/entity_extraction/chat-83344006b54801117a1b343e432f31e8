Then test the Rclone connection with command:\n\n```bash\n  .\\rclone.exe lsd allas:\n```\n\nNote that also in this case the connection will work only for the next 8 hours.\n\n#### Configuring S3 connection in Windows\n\n!!! Note\n    Remember that you need to be careful and security-aware when configuring S3 connection to Allas. The S3 keys are stored in a readable format in your home directory and anyone who can read your keys can access Allas until the keys are expilicitly revoked from Allas. Removing the keys from your own computer is not enough to deactivate them.\n\nTo check your S3 keys, open a connection to Puhti (or some other machine that can run `allas_conf` tool). If you don't yet have S3 connection to your Allas project activated, open it with commands:\n\n```\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf -m S3\n```\n\nThis creates a local configuration file that we will later on use to check some values.\n\nThen switch to your Windows _Command Prompt_ and start the Rclone configuration process by executing command:\n\n```bash\nrclone config\n```\n\nAnd do following selections:\n\n   1. Select **n** to create a _New remote_\n   2. Name the remote as: **s3allas**\n   3. From the list of storage protocols, select the number that defines: _Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers including AWS, Alibaba, Ceph, Digital Ocean, Dreamhost, IBM COS, Minio, and Tencent COS_\n   4. Next you are asked to Choose your S3 provider. Select option that provides _Any other S3 compatible provider_\n   5. Then select that you _Enter AWS credentials in the next step_ \n   6. Give the _AWS access key_. You can check this in Puhti with command: \n   `grep access_key $HOME/.s3cfg  | cut -d \" \" -f3`\n   7. Give the _AWS secret access key_. You can check this in Puhti with command: \n   `grep secret_key $HOME/.s3cfg  | cut -d \" \" -f3`\n   8. Region: **1**\n   9. Endpoint: **a3s.fi**\n   10. Location constant: (blank, just press Enter)\n   11. acl: **1**\n   12. Edit advanced config: **n**\n   13. Remote config: **y** (yes, this is ok)\n   14. **q**, quit config\n \nAfter this you can access your Allas project using Rclone remote _s3allas_. For example:\n\n```bash\nrclone.exe lsd s3allas:\n```\n\nThis connection stays active in your laptop until you delete it.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
