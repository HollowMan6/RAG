For example, when working with large Python\n  environments, you can easily see a difference in start-up times between a containerized\n  environment and the application installed directly on the shared file system using\n  Conda. This applies especially when running at scale on an HPC system.\n- **File I/O throughput:**  Deploying I/O intensive jobs on HPC systems is a major\n  issue for Lustre file systems. While containers might not provide a full solution,\n  the fact that containerized applications start from a single image file results in\n  significantly fewer requests to the Lustre server nodes (OSS and MDS) compared to\n  Conda-based installations, which read an excessive number of files each time an\n  application is launched. [SquashFS images](run-existing.md#mounting-datasets-with-squashfs)\n  can also be used together with Apptainer containers to create compact images\n  of your dataset that are interpreted as a single file by Lustre.\n- **Portability and reproducibility:** Containerized applications can be deployed\n  easily in different computing environments and they run the same way regardless\n  of where they are deployed.\n- **Greater efficiency:** As containers are lightweight in nature, CPU and memory\n  utilization is not an issue. Thus, containerized applications are easy to scale\n  up across the cluster.\n- **Easy installation:** Once you have an apptainer image, launching a container\n  from the image is very easy. No real installation is needed.\n\nTo make working with containers in CSC's environment as transparent and easy as\npossible, a [container wrapper tool](tykky.md) for packaging installations has\nbeen made available.\n\n## A non-technical description\n\nAs a beginner-friendly introduction to containers, let's use the analogy of packaging\na pet in a cage before traveling. A pet essentially needs a living environment (food,\nwater, etc.) and a cage to contain the living environment. Once a pet is packaged,\na traveler can take it (e.g. by car, train, flight, etc...) wherever without affecting\nthe function of the pet by the external environment. Similarly, imagine how a developer\ncould ensure the same functionality of an application independent of the host environment.\nOne solution is to run the application in an isolated environment (just like caging).\nIn other words, packaging up the whole application (process) along with its dependencies\nensures the same runtime environment for the application independent of the host\ncomputing environment. This is essentially the basic idea behind containers.\n\nLet's now understand how an application runs in an isolated environment at a slightly\nmore technical level. The Linux kernel process controls access to the computer hardware.\nAll other processes rely on the kernel to interact with the environment, memory, disks,\nnetwork, etc. One could say that all processes, except the kernel, live inside a bubble\n(i.e, host environment), created by the kernel. Normally, when you start new processes,\nthe kernel copies the environment from the parent process to the new child processes.\nThe child processes live inside the same bubble. However, when starting a new process,\nyou can ask the kernel to show a completely different environment to the child process.\nThis is called \"running the application in a container\". In particular, you can ask the\nkernel to show a completely different root file system to the new process. The file\nsystem can come from a single file, \"a container image\", that the kernel just shows\nto the new process as a regular file system. This file system image can contain\ncompletely different files from the file system of the parent process. Effectively,\nthis allows packaging all the necessary components of a given Linux distribution and\nall the software dependencies for an application into a single file, which can be run\nin any Linux machine with a suitable kernel and virtualization support. In cloud\nenvironments, this makes it possible to run applications transparently irrespective\nof the Linux distribution. In HPC environments this can also mitigate the above outlined\nparallel file system performance issues.\n\n## More information on creating and running containers at CSC\n\n- [Creating HPC-friendly containers](creating.md)\n- [Running existing containers](run-existing.md)\n- [Easy-to-use container wrapper tool](tykky.md)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SINGULARITY/APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A technology that allows containers to be launched from a Lustre parallel file system without root privileges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE PARALLEL FILE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of file system that enables high-performance storage and is used in HPC environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that can be used in containerized environments for faster startup times in HPC systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package manager that installs applications directly on shared file systems, compared here with containerized applications for efficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUASHFS IMAGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A format used with Apptainer containers to create compact images of datasets, interpreted as a single file by Lustre)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The computing environment where containers are being utilized to improve efficiency and performance in HPC systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTAINER WRAPPER TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool made available in CSC's environment for packaging installations easily)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGULARITY/APPTAINER<|>LUSTRE PARALLEL FILE SYSTEM<|>Singularity/Apptainer can be launched from a Lustre parallel file system without root privileges<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SQUASHFS IMAGES<|>SINGULARITY/APPTAINER<|>SquashFS images can be used together with Apptainer containers to create compact images<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTAINER WRAPPER TOOL<|>CSC<|>The container wrapper tool is made available in CSC's computing environment to facilitate working with containers<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
