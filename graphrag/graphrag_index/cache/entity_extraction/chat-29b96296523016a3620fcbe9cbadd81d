Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2.

This is due to the usage of individual jobs/job steps that bloat the Slurm log\nand degrade the performance of the batch job scheduler. To maximize throughput and\nperformance, we recommend the Nextflow workflow tasks to be run using the\n[HyperQueue](../../apps/hyperqueue.md) meta-scheduler as the\nexecutor. This page provides an example batch script for this purpose.\n\n!!! Note\n    Whenever you're unsure how to run your workflow efficiently, don't hesitate\n    to [contact CSC Service Desk](../contact.md).\n\n## Example batch script\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=medium\n#SBATCH --account=project_2001659 \n#SBATCH --nodes=3\n#SBATCH --exclusive\n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n\n# Load the required modules\nmodule load hyperqueue\nmodule load nextflow\n\n# Create a per job directory\nwrkdir=$PWD/WRKDIR-$SLURM_JOB_ID\nmkdir -p $wrkdir/.hq-server\n\n# Set the directory which hyperqueue will use \nexport HQ_SERVER_DIR=$wrkdir/.hq-server\n\n# Make sure nextflow uses the right executor and\n# knows how much it can submit.\necho \"executor {\n  queueSize = $(( 128*SLURM_NNODES ))\n  name = 'hq'\n  cpus = $(( 128*SLURM_NNODES )) \n}\" > $wrkdir/nextflow.config\n\ncp main.nf $wrkdir\nhq server start &\nsrun --cpu-bind=none --hint=nomultithread --mpi=none -N $SLURM_NNODES -n $SLURM_NNODES -c 128 hq worker start --cpus=128 &\n\nnum_up=$(hq worker list | grep RUNNING | wc -l)\nwhile true; do\n\n    echo \"Checking if workers have started\"\n    if [[ $num_up -eq $SLURM_NNODES ]];then\n        echo \"Workers started\"\n        break\n    fi\n    echo \"$num_up/$SLURM_NNODES workers have started\"\n    sleep 1\n    num_up=$(hq worker list | grep RUNNING | wc -l)\n\ndone\n\ncd $wrkdir\nnextflow run main.nf\n\n# Make sure we exit cleanly once nextflow is done\nhq worker stop all\nhq server stop\n```\n\nWhere `main.nf` would be the nextflow script you want to run. Note that this batch script\ncreates a per job directory and copies the nextflow script there before starting. \n\n```\n$ ls\nexample_jobscript.sh main.nf \n$ sbatch example_jobscript.sh\nSubmitted batch job 137\n$ ls\nexample_jobscript.sh main.nf WRKDIR-137\n$ ls WRKDIR-137\nmain.nf work\n```\n\n## More information\n\n* [General guidelines for high-throughput computing in CSC's HPC\n  environment](../../computing/running/throughput.md)\n* [Basic](https://yetulaxman.github.io/Biocontainer/tutorials/nextflow_tutorial.html)\n  and [advanced Nextflow tutorials for Puhti](nextflow-puhti.md)\n* [Official Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)\n* [Official HyperQueue documentation](https://it4innovations.github.io/hyperqueue/stable/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
