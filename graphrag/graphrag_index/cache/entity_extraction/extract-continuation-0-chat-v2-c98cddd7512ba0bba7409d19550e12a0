Data that needs to be stored for a longer time than just a few\nweeks should be copied to Allas object storage service. Allas provides a\nplatform that you can use to store your data as long as your CSC project is\nactive. In addition to storage, Allas can be used for transporting data between\ndifferent servers and sharing data with other users.\n\n* [Allas user guide](index.md)\n\nThis tutorial provides four examples for using Allas on Puhti and Mahti. The\nexamples are based on interactively executed commands, and thus apply only for\nrelatively small datasets (max. some hundreds of GBs).\n\n1. [The first example](#example-1-using-allas-with-a-commands) uses the\n   *a-commands* (`a-put`, `a-get`) for uploading data from Mahti to Allas, and\n   then downloading the data to Puhti.\n2. [The second example](#example-2-using-allas-with-rclone) transfers the same\n   data using *Rclone*.\n3. [The third example](#example-3-uploading-large-files-to-allas) focuses on\n   uploading large files to Allas.\n4. [The fourth example](#example-4-uploading-complex-directory-structures-to-allas)\n   handles the case in which the dataset to be copied includes a large amount\n   of files.\n\nThe a-commands are better suited for cases where the data is mainly used within\nthe CSC computing environment (Puhti, Mahti). The second option, Rclone, is\ngood for cases when the data will be used outside CSC too.\n\n## Getting access to Allas\n\nBy default, CSC computing projects do not have access to Allas. Thus, the first\nthing is to\n[add the Allas service to your project](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md).\nThis is done in the [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) portal. Note that only the\nproject manager can apply for access.\n\nThe default storage quota in Allas is 10 TB. As this space is shared with all\nproject members, it is possible that the space is not sufficient. In that case,\nyou should estimate how much space is needed and request more space. The\nrequest should be sent to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md). Please\ninclude in your quota request:\n\n1. The ID/name of your project\n2. The amount of Allas space needed\n3. A short description of the data to be stored \n\nNote that the data stored in Allas\n[consume billing units of the project](../../accounts/billing.md).\n\n## Example 1: Using Allas with a-commands\n\n### A. Uploading data from Mahti to Allas\n\nThe a-commands are Allas-specific tools that allow an easy start with Allas.\nThe a-commands archive and move data automatically. You can also compress your\ndata before storage. For example, for text-formatted data compression reduces\nthe storage space needed, but on the other hand makes the transfer process\nslightly slower. The a-commands are a good option for miscellaneous data that\nis mostly used in the CSC environment.\n\nIn this example, we have a subdirectory `genomes/zebrafish` in the scratch\ndirectory of a project in Mahti (`/scratch/project_2001659`). The `zebrafish`\ndirectory contains eight files listed below:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login11 ~]$ ls /scratch/project_2001659/genomes/zebrafish\nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.1.bt2      Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.2.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.3.bt2      Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.4.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.1.bt2  Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.2.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.fa            Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa.fai\n```\n\nTo copy the content of this directory to Allas, we first set up the Allas\nenvironment:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\n```\n\nThen, we open a connection to Allas using the command `allas-conf`. The command\nasks for the user's CSC password and then lists the Allas projects that are\naccessible. In this case, we select `project_2001659`.\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login11 ~]$ allas-conf\nMode swift\nPlease enter CSC password for account kkayttaj: <password>\nChecking projects available for your account.\nPlease wait.\n1) project_2000982     2) project_2001659     3) project_2000136      4) abort allas_conf\nPlease choose a project by giving an item number from the list above: 2\nConfiguration will be done for project: project_2001659\nProtocols:\n  swift\nConnection stays active for eight hours.\n```\n\n`allas-conf` opens a connection to the specified Allas project for eight hours.\nIf we want to start using another project, we need to run `allas-conf` again.\nHowever, in a single shell session `allas-conf` enables only one Allas project\nto be active at a time. Note that certain tools, for example `rclone`, can\nnonetheless be set up to use several Allas projects at the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC supercomputers, including Puhti and Mahti, do not offer permanent storage for research data, directing users to Allas object storage service for longer-term storage needs)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of the CSC supercomputers that, along with Mahti, does not provide permanent storage space for research data)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of the CSC supercomputers that, along with Puhti, does not provide permanent storage space for research data)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is an object storage service provided by CSC for storing data as long as the CSC project is active, also facilitating data transport and sharing)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MyCSC is a portal where CSC computing project managers can apply for access to services like Allas)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The CSC Service Desk is the contact point for requesting additional storage space in Allas and other support requests)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ALLAS<|>CSC supercomputers use Allas for long-term data storage, indicating a dependency on Allas for data management beyond temporary storage<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Puhti users are directed to use Allas for storing data longer than the supercomputer's temporary storage allows<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Mahti users are directed to use Allas for storing data longer than the supercomputer's temporary storage allows<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYCSC<|>ALLAS<|>MyCSC portal is used by project managers to apply for access to Allas, showing an administrative link between the portal and the storage service<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ALLAS<|>Requests for additional Allas storage space are directed to the CSC Service Desk, indicating a support relationship<|>5)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
