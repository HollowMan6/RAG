Rahti 2 supports webhooks to trigger rebuilds. This means that each BuildConfig is listening to a particular URL that includes a secret (more about that later), and that when this URL is called, a build will be triggered for a default branch.\n\n!!! info \"Default branch name\"\n\n    In Rahti 2 the default branch name is `master`. Branches named otherwise (e.g. GitHub's default value `main`) will be ignored, so make sure that both sides use the same branch name.\n\nThere are few types of formats supported: Generic, GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. This means that if the source code of the application is in Gitlab, the Gitlab URL type must be selected.\n\n![Triggers](../img/trigger.drawio.svg)\n\nIn this example we will use the GitHub type.\n\n## Creating a secret\n\nIn the `Developer` menu, go to the **Secrets** page. Make sure that you are in the right project and then click in **Create -> Webhook secret**. Write any sensible name. And click in Generate. Write down the generated secret. And **Save**.\n\n![CreateWebhookSecret](../img/CreateWebhookSecret.png)\n\n## Getting the URL\n\nYou need an already created `BuildConfig` object, or create a new one. In order to create a new BuildConfig, check out the [Creating an image](../rahti2/images/creating.md) article.\n\nNow you need to edit the build config (**Actions -> Edit BuildConfig**), and add a trigger. To do this, click in \"Trigger\", in the bottom of the edit page, in the \"Advanced options\" section. Then, click in \"Add trigger\". The new trigger must have a type, in our case it will be \"GitHub\". It also needs a secret, select the secret you created in the previous step.\n\n![Edit BuildConfig](../img/editBuildConfig.png)\n\nWhen the `BuildConfig` is configured, you can get the URL via the webinterface. Using the `Developer` menu, go to the **Builds** page, and select the `BuildConfig`. In the `Webhooks` section, you will see \"Copy URL with Secret\". Click on it, and the URL will be in your clipboard.\n\n![Copy URL with Secret](../img/webhooks.png)\n\n## GitHub\n\nOnce you got the URL and the secret, go to <https://github.com>. There you should go to the repository where the code is, and in **Settings -> Webhooks**, click in \"Add webhook\".\n\n![GitHub Webhooks](../img/GitHubWebhook.png)\n\nYou just need to fill up the \"Payload URL\" and the \"Secret\", and change the content type to `Application/json`.\n\n![Add webhook](../img/Addwebhook.png)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
