See also [EOReader band mapping graphics](https://eoreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/optical_band_mapping.html) for an overview of observed wavelength intervals for different optical sensors.\n    \n    \n## Where can I find the data?\n\nCommercial datasets are usually available from data provider, while open datasets may be available in different processing stages from different services. Where possible, it might be a good idea to check processing options close to the data, for direct access or faster download. While graphical browse and download services can provide a good overview of the data and are easy to use, the download of huge amounts of data gets considerably easier using a bulk downloader or download API (Application Programming Interface).\n\n!!! default \"STAC\"\n\n    Many data providers provide a Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) of their datasets. These catalogs help in finding available data based on time and location with the possibility for multiple additional filters, such as cloud cover and resolution. The [STAC Index](https://www.stacindex.org/) provides a nice overview of available catalogs from all over the world. The STAC Index page includes many resources for learning and utilizing STAC. Finnish data is available from [Paituli STAC](https://paituli.csc.fi/stac.html). Check out also CSC's examples for utilizing [STAC from Python](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/python/STAC) and [STAC from R](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/STAC).\n\n### EO data at CSC\n\nSome Finnish EO datasets are available locally at CSC. [Paituli STAC](https://paituli.csc.fi/stac.html) includes all raster data available at CSC.\n\n* **Landsat mosaics** in Puhti. \n* **Sentinel-2 L2A data**, selection of cloud-free tiles in Allas. \n* [More information and list of all spatial datasets in CSC computing environment](../../../data/datasets/spatial-data-in-csc-computing-env.md)\n\n### EO data download services  \n\n**[SYKE/FMI, Finnish image mosaics](https://www.syke.fi/fi-FI/Tutkimus__kehittaminen/Tutkimus_ja_kehittamishankkeet/Hankkeet/Paikkatietoalusta_PTA)** : Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat mosaics, also index mosaics. For several time periods per year. These are included in [Paituli STAC](https://paituli.csc.fi/stac.html)\n\n[**ESA Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) provides worldwide main Sentinel products, see below for more information.\n\n[**FinHub**](https://finhub.nsdc.fmi.fi/#/home) covers Finland and the Baltics and offers Sentinel-2 L1C (but not L2A) and Sentinel 1 SLC, GRD and OCN products. No STAC. [sentinelsat](https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python package is suitable for downloading data from FinHub, see [CSC FinHub sentinelsat example](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/sentinel). \n    \n[**USGS EarthExplorer**](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) huge datastore with focus on US data, but also worldwide Landsat datasets.

[Landsat Collection 2 STAC](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/spatiotemporal-asset-catalog-stac)\n    \n[**NASA Earthdata**](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov) provides among many others [harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 dataset](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

Some of the data can be downloaded only on \"requestor pays\" basis. Currently, [Sentinel-2 L2A Cloud-optimized Geotiffs](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs/) by Element 84 are available for free, inc. STAC.\n\n**[Microsoft planetary computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com)** provides a STAC of all available data, which includes Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS. \n\n[**Google Cloud Storage open EO data**](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets), including Sentinel-2 L1C and Landsat Collection 1 data. Data can be downloaded for example with [FORCE](../../../apps/force.md).\n    \n[**Terramonitor**](https://www.terramonitor.com) provides pre-prosessed analysis ready Sentinel-2 data, also from Finland.
