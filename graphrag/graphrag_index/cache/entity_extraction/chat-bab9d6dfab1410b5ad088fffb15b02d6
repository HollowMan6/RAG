warning \"Avoid installing a lot of small files\"\n\n    The home and project directories reside on the [Lustre][lustre] based parallel\n    file system on [LUMI-P][lumi-p] which does not perform well with\n    installations of software containing a lot of small files, e.g. Python or\n    R environments installed via Conda or pip. For such software a container\n    based approach must be used. See the [Python packages installation guide\n    ][python-install] for an overview of options for installing Conda/pip\n    environments.\n\n---\n\n## Pre-installed software\n\nOn LUMI, we provide some pre-installed software in both central software stacks (managed by the LUMI User Support Team) and local software collections (managed by local organizations in the LUMI consortium):\n\n- Central LUMI software stacks\n\n    A full overview of software, that is either pre-installed in the [LUMI software stacks][software-stacks],\n    or available as a user-installable LUMI-specific build recipe for the [EasyBuild][easybuild] package manager can be found in the [LUMI software library][software-library].\n    \n    Whether software is pre-installed or user-installable can be found when you open the page of the specific software.\n    For software installed in the [central LUMI software stacks][software-stacks],\n    the first channel to get help on a specific module is through the `module help` command,\n    but the LUMI [Software Library pages][software-library] sometimes contain more information\n    on how to run the software, or more information about specific options that\n    were chosen when installing the software on LUMI.\n    \n    Consult the [module environment page][module-env] for instructions on identifying the pre-installed software on LUMI through the module system instead.\n    Read more about the user-installable software with EasyBuild in the [next section](#installing-additional-software).\n\n- Software collections by local organizations\n\n    There is also pre-installed software available provided by local LUMI\n    consortium organizations. These software collections are available for all LUMI\n    users, but are updated and supported by the local LUMI consortium organizations\n    themselves, not by the LUMI User Support Team.\n\n       - [CSC installed software collection](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/local/csc/)\n\n## Installing additional software\n\nWe offer two package management systems to install software on LUMI, with varying levels of support:\n\n- [EasyBuild][easybuild]:\n\n    EasyBuild is the primary software installation tool on LUMI. It is used to install\n    most software in the [central software stack][software-stacks] on LUMI, but it\n    is also extremely easy to install additional software in your personal or project\n    space and have it integrate fully with the software stacks.\n\n    An overview of (almost) all software that we provide pre-installed in the\n    central software stack or for which we provide ready-to-use EasyBuild build\n    recipes for a user installation can be found in the [LUMI Software\n    Library][software-library].\n\n- [Spack][spack]\n\n    Spack is another popular package manager to install software mostly from sources for\n    optimal performance on HPC systems. We provide a Spack configuration that is\n    configured to use of the compilers available on LUMI and which can install packages\n    in the upstream Spack repository. However, we do no package development ourselves in Spack.\n\nThe preferred location for software installations is your `/project` directory,\nso that a software installation can be shared with all users in your project.\nSoftware can also be installed in your home directory, but it is not recommended\nand you will not get additional quota for it. Creating permanent software\ninstallations in your `/scratch` or `/flash` directories is not recommended as\nthese will be cleaned automatically in the future when the file system starts\nto fill up.\n\nIf you intend to install Python packages, please consult the [Python packages\ninstallation guide][python-install] for an overview of your options.\n\n## Alternatives to installing software yourself\n\nAs alternatives to installing software, you may:\n\n- Use an Apptainer/Singularity container\n\n    You can bring a [Singularity/Apptainer software container][singularity-container]\n    and run it using the [Singularity container runtime\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
