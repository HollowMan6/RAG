This page provides guidance for getting\nstarted with using our HPC resources.\n\nIt is recommended that new users complete the *CSC Computing Environment*\ncourse, which provides an in-depth introduction to CSC services. The next live\nteaching instance can be found in the\n[CSC training calendar](https://csc.fi/en/trainings/training-calendar/).\nA\n[self-learning implementation](https://csc.fi/en/training-calendar/csc-computing-environment-self-learning/)\nis also available. The\n[course materials](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/) are accessible\nwithout having to sign up, and are very useful by themselves.\n\nFor a more general introduction to HPC, we recommend the\n[*Elements of Supercomputing*](https://edukamu.fi/elements-of-supercomputing/)\nonline course.\n\n!!! note \"Need support?\"\n\n    Do not hesitate to [contact the CSC Service Desk](../contact.md) if you\n    have any questions about using CSC services. We are happy to help!\n\n## Which system should I use?\n\n### Puhti\n\nNew users are recommended to start working on the\n[Puhti supercomputer](../../computing/available-systems.md#puhti).\nCompared to Mahti, it has much more\n[pre-installed software](../../apps/by_system.md#puhti), more GPU nodes, and\ntypically more available memory per CPU core. Additionally, GPU nodes and some\nCPU nodes on Puhti have\n[fast local NVMe storage](../../computing/disk.md#temporary-local-disk-areas).\n\n### Mahti\n\nIf you know that your computations are highly parallelizable, you should\nconsider running them on the\n[Mahti supercomputer](../../computing/available-systems.md#mahti).\nCompared to Puhti, Mahti has many more CPU nodes and cores per node. Mahti is\nintended for computations that are able to effectively utilize at least an\nentire CPU node.\n\nAdditionally, while Mahti has fewer GPU nodes than Puhti, the A100 GPUs on Mahti\nare considerably more powerful than the V100 GPUs on Puhti, which makes Mahti\nalso suitable for demanding [machine learning](ml-guide.md) applications.\nIn contrast to Puhti, only the GPU nodes on Mahti have fast local NVMe storage\navailable.\n\n### LUMI\n\nThe [LUMI supercomputer](../../computing/available-systems.md#lumi)\nis one of the fastest in the world. It is intended primarily\nfor running computations that benefit from the large amount of high-performance\nGPUs in its LUMI-G hardware partition. Whereas the GPUs on Puhti and Mahti are\nmanufactured by Nvidia, the LUMI GPUs are made by AMD, so make sure that your\nGPU applications are able to run on AMD GPUs. LUMI has\n[its own documentation pages](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/).\n\n!!! note \"On supercomputing\"\n\n    CSC supercomputers offer resources that, when properly used, are well-beyond\n    what the most sophisticated consumer devices are capable of. However, *you are\n    not the only one using them*. On your personal workstation, you have, in\n    principle, immediate access to resources. On a supercomputer, which is a shared\n    system, you must typically queue for them, since their demand tends to be higher\n    than their supply. See our [usage policy](../../computing/usage-policy.md)\n    for more information.\n\n    It is also worth keeping in mind that running your computations on a\n    supercomputer only improves performance if you play to its strengths.\n    Supercomputers are powerful because they allow for\n    [parallel computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing).\n    If your code is not written to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, or one or\n    more GPUs, there might be no benefit over running it on your own workstation.\n    However, high memory and/or storage requirements, as well as availability of\n    pre-installed software and licenses are other factors which may make using\n    CSC supercomputers attractive for you.\n\n## How to access CSC supercomputers?\n\n### Web interface\n\nPuhti, Mahti and LUMI each have\n[their own web interface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md), which allows\ninteracting with the supercomputer through a web browser. The web interface is a\ngood choice for interactive computing, such as analyzing, exploring and\nvisualizing data. For this purpose, the web interface features multiple\ninteractive applications, like\n[Visual Studio Code](../../computing/webinterface/vscode.md),\n[Jupyter](../../computing/webinterface/jupyter.md) and\n[RStudio](../../computing/webinterface/rstudio.md). In addition, it provides a\n[desktop environment](../../computing/webinterface/desktop.md) featuring\nsoftware with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), as well as an\n[accelerated visualization app](../../computing/webinterface/accelerated-visualization.md)\nfor GPU-accelerated visualization and rendering. For demanding computation,\nlike running full-scale simulations or training neural networks, you should use\nthe command-line interface, since it allows you to access more resources and\nschedule your jobs.\n\n- [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)\n- [Mahti web interface](https://www.mahti.csc.fi)\n- [LUMI web interface](https://www\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
