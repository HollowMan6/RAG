The tool is \ndesigned to predict the functional description (DE) and gene ontology (GO) classes. \n\n## License\n\nPANNZER has been published with the [GNU Public Licence v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\n\n## Available\n\nPANNZER is available on Puhti.\n\n## Usage\n\nOn Puhti, SANSPANZ annotation tool can be accessed with the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nAfter loading the module, you can launch SANSPANZ analysis using command `runsanspanz.py`. For example:\n\n```bash\nrunsanspanz.py -R -m Pannzer -s \"species name\" -i  input_seqs.fasta -o results.csv\n```\n\nThe species name is used to determine taxonomic distances. \nThe output is written to the file defined with option `-o`. Also, three other output files are created:\n\n* **Pannzer.out_1** contains details of the description (DE) prediction.\n* **Pannzer.out_2** contains details of the GO prediction.\n* **Pannzer.out_3** is a summary of all predicted annotations.\n\nPannzer.out_3 can be converted to HTML-format with command `anno2html.pl`:\n\n```bash\nanno2html.pl < Pannzer.out_3 > annotations.html\n```\n\nIf you upload this file to Allas with the command:\n\n```bash\na-flip annotations.html\n```\n\nyou can use the link provided by `a-flip` to study the results with your browser.\n\nNote, that on Puhti you should always use `runsanspanz.py` with option `-R` that sends the\nanalysis jobs to the annotation server maintained by the Holm group. Thus, the job does not use \nthe resources of Puhti, and it can be run as an interactive job on a login node.\n\n## More information\n\nFor more information, execute command:\n\n```bash\nrunsanspanz.py -h\n```\n\nOr study the PANNZER home page:\n\n* [PANNZER home page](http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/sanspanz/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PANNZER2/SANSPANZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A fully automated service for functional annotation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins of unknown function, designed to predict functional description and gene ontology classes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU PUBLIC LICENCE V3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The license under which PANNZER is published, allowing for free use under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>The platform on which PANNZER is available and can be accessed for running SANSPANZ annotation tool)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLM GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maintains the annotation server to which analysis jobs are sent when using PANNZER on Puhti)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANNZER2/SANSPANZ<|>GNU PUBLIC LICENCE V3<|>PANNZER2/SANSPANZ is published under the GNU Public Licence v3<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANNZER2/SANSPANZ<|>PUHTI<|>PANNZER2/SANSPANZ is available on Puhti for running SANSPANZ annotation tool<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANNZER2/SANSPANZ<|>HOLM GROUP<|>The Holm Group maintains the annotation server used by PANNZER2/SANSPANZ on Puhti<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
