Using Podman in SD Desktop\n\nThe [Podman](https://podman.io/) container manager is available in Ubuntu 22-based SD Desktop virtual machines.\nPodman is able to use Docker containers and thus it can be used to replace Docker in your SD Desktop workflows.\n\nAs SD Desktop doesn't have access to software container repositories, \nyou must save the container you wish to use into a _Docker archive file_ in some other environment where you have Podman or Docker.\nThis file must then be imported to SD Desktop through SD Connect.\n\nFor example, to use _Trimmomatic_ software in SD Desktop of CSC project `project_2000123`, you could use following procedure.\n\nIn a Linux server with Docker available, create a Docker container file that includes Trimmomatic.\nThis can be done with commands:\n\n```text\nsudo docker pull staphb/trimmomatic:latest\nsudo docker images\nsudo docker save -o trimmomatic.docker 932a84b67790\n```\n\nHere the last command uses container ID (932a84b67790) that was checked with the `docker images` command.\n\nThe Docker file needs to be uploaded to SD Connect from where it can be copied to a SD Desktop virtual machine.\nIn this example the Docker file `trimmomatic.docker` is uploaded to SD Connect using `a-put` command:\n\n```text\na-put --sdx trimmomatic.docker -b 2000123_docker  \n```\nThe command above encrypts the data (`--sdx`) and stores it to SD Connect bucket `2000123_docker`.\n\nTo use the copied container, open or refresh the Data Gateway connection in your SD Desktop virtual machine. Then open a terminal window and copy the Docker file to the local disk of your virtual machine. Now you can load the Docker container to your Podman environment. \n\nIn the case of the Trimmomatic container you could do the container import with commands:\n\n```text\ncp Projects/SD-Connect/project_2000123/2000123_docker/trimmomatic.docker ./\npodman image load -i trimmomatic.docker\npodman image list \npodman image tag 932a84b67790 trimmomatic\n```\n\nIn SD Desktop you must always add definition `--cgroup-manager cgroupfs` when running a Podman container.\nFor example, using the imported container to run Trimmomatic filtering for file `/media/volume/rawdata.fastq` could be now done\nwith command: \n \n```text\npodman --cgroup-manager cgroupfs run -v /media/volume:/media/volume trimmomatic:latest trimmomatic SE /media/volume/rawdata.fastq  /media/volume/flitered.fastq MINLEN:100\n```\n\nIn the command above the first part of the command is the actual `podman` command that defines the Podman operation (`run`), and mounting between local and container environments (`-v`).\n\n```text\npodman --cgroup-manager cgroupfs run -v /media/volume:/media/volume trimmomatic:latest\n```\n\nRest of the command defines the actual `trimmomatic` analysis command:\n\n```text\ntrimmomatic SE /media/volume/rawdata.fastq  /media/volume/flitered.fastq MINLEN:100\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PODMAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Podman is a container manager that is available in Ubuntu 22-based SD Desktop virtual machines and can use Docker containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Desktop is a virtual machine environment based on Ubuntu 22 that supports software container workflows with Podman and Docker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Connect is a platform for transferring files to SD Desktop virtual machines, including Docker archive files for container use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIMMOMATIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trimmomatic is a software tool for trimming sequences in bioinformatics, available as a Docker container)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC PROJECT `PROJECT_2000123`<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific project within the CSC environment, identified by project number 2000123, utilizing SD Desktop for bioinformatics workflows)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODMAN<|>SD DESKTOP<|>Podman is used within SD Desktop virtual machines to manage containers, offering a replacement for Docker<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER<|>SD DESKTOP<|>Docker containers can be managed and used within SD Desktop through Podman<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>SD DESKTOP<|>SD Connect is used to transfer Docker archive files into SD Desktop for use in container workflows<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIMMOMATIC<|>DOCKER<|>Trimmomatic is available as a Docker container, which can be managed using Podman in SD Desktop<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC PROJECT `PROJECT_2000123`<|>SD DESKTOP<|>The CSC project `project_2000123` utilizes SD Desktop for its bioinformatics workflows, including the use of Trimmomatic software<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
