Batch queue system and interactive use\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 4\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/batch_jobs/exercise_retrieving-bio-data.html\n---\n# Exercise: Retrieving data from bio data repositories\n\n> This exercise covers retrieving data from various commonly used bio data repositories.\n\n1. We will do these exercises in an interactive session launched using the [sinteractive](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/) command:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project>   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Alternatively, open a compute node shell through the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi).\n3. To access the applications in parts 2 and 3, we will need to load the `biokit` module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Create a directory for yourself under the `/scratch` directory of your project and move there:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\ncd /scratch/<project>/$USER         # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\nðŸ’­ Everyone in a project shares the same `/scratch` directory, so it is a good idea to use subdirectories for each user and task to avoid accidentally deleting or overwriting others' files.\n\nðŸ—¯ In normal usage it may be a good idea to use the `chmod` command to alter file access rights so that only you have write access to your own subfolder, but please do not do this if you are using a CSC course project, as it will make clean-up after the course harder.\n\nðŸ’¡ You can find more information about this on the [Disk areas page in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/).\n\n## 1. Downloading data with `curl`\n\n1. `curl` and `wget` are general tools to download data from an URL.\n2. Download a dataset from internet using `curl` and uncompress it. The dataset contains some *Pythium* genomes with related BWA indexes.\n\n```bash\ncurl https://a3s.fi/course_12.11.2019/pythium.tgz > pythium.tgz\nls\ntar -zxvf pythium.tgz  \nls\n```\n\n## 2. Downloading data with NCBI edirect\n\n1. Create directory `cellulose_synthase` and move to this new directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir cellulose_synthase\ncd cellulose_synthase\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Next we use the [NCBI edirect tool](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/edirect/) to retrieve some data.\n3. Check how many proteins are found in the NCBI protein database for *Pythium* species (`count` row in the results):\n\n```bash\nesearch -db protein -query \"Pythium [ORGN]\" \n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Check the number of proteins for **cellulose synthase 1**, **cellulose synthase 2** and **cellulose synthase 3** that are found for *Pythium* species.\n5. For cellulose synthase 1 this can be done with:\n\n```bash\nesearch -db protein -query \"Pythium [ORGN] AND cellulose synthase 1 [PROT]\"\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 5\"}\n6. Do the same for the other proteins.\n7. Retrieve the cellulose synthase 3 sequences in Fasta format\n\n```bash\nesearch -db protein -query \"Pythium [ORGN] AND cellulose synthase 3 [PROT]\" | efetch -format fasta > cesy3.fasta\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 7\"}\n8. Run the `esearch` command that tells how many **cellulose synthase 3** sequences there are in total in the NCBI protein database?\n\n### Extra exercise for fast ones\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 8\"}\n9. Align the cellulose synthase 3 set with `mafft`\n\n```bash\nmafft cesy3.fasta > cesy3_aln.fasta\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 9\"}\n10. Study the results:\n\n```bash\ninfoalign cesy3_aln.fasta\nshowalign cesy3_aln.fasta\n```\n\n## 3. Downloading with enaDataGet\n\n1. Check the options of `enaDataGet` with command:\n\n```bash\nenaDataGet -h\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Download a file (Pythium iwayamai genome assembly)\n\n```bash\nenaDataGet AKYA02000000 -f fasta\ngunzip AKYA02.fasta.gz \nls\n```\n\n### Extra exercise for fast ones\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Study the downloaded file:\n\n```bash\nhead -20 AKYA02.fasta\ntail AKYA02.fasta\ninfoseq_summary AKYA02.fasta\n```\n\n## 4. Finishing up\n\n1.
