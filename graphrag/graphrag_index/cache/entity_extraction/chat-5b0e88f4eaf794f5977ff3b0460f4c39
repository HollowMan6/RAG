Note \n    Before any data can be made available for researchers in the Sensitive Data services, you need to confirm that the necessary legal agreements are in place between the data controller and CSC. The first register data set must always be submitted in collaboration with the CSC Sensitive Data (SD) services team. You can start a conversation with the SD services team by sending a message to the [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Sensitive Data).\n\nAfter the process is established for the first time, the representative of the data controller can manage the following data submissions on their own. Help is always available via the service desk. Below are the instructions for the data submission and access control.\n\n\n## Data submission\n\n!!! Note\n    Data controller and the persons responsible for the data transfer need to create CSC accounts by logging in with Haka or Virtu credentials at the [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi/). If you don't have Haka or Virtu credentials, you need to request an account from [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Sensitive Data).\n\n### Step 1: Organizational profile in SD Apply\n\nA representative of the data controller has to make the data available for the research group in SD Apply service.\n\nAfter you have created an CSC account, you can log in to [SD Apply service](https://sd-apply.csc.fi/).\n\n[![SD Apply login page](images/apply/apply_login.png)](images/apply/apply_login.png)\n\n!!! note\n    Always use the same identity provider when you log in to SD Apply because all your actions are connected to your login identity (i.e. use always only Haka/Virtu login or the CSC login).\n\nAfter the first log in, CSC service desk can create an organizational profile for the data controller, which will be used for all the data submissions coming from this organization, and assign you as an owner of the organizational profile. There can also be multiple owners for one organization.\n\n### Step 2: Creating objects in SD Apply\n\nAfter you have been set as the owner of the organization profile, you can create a workflow, form and license for the organization in SD Apply.\n\n1. To the **form**, you add all the information needed for access applications. This information will be shown to the applicants in SD Apply. To the form, you can also add fields for the applicant to fill, e.g. ask them to confirm the journal number or other identification information by submitting it via the form.\n2. **License** specifies the terms of use for the data, which the applicants need to approve when they fill in the access application form. In the license, you can for example refer to the terms specified in the data permit.\n3. With a **workflow**, you define who will manage the access applications of the organization in SD services. These named users will always receive a notification via email about new access applications and can approve or reject the applications in SD Apply.\n\nThe forms and licenses are public in SD Apply, so these should not include any sensitive information. These three objects will be used for all secondary use datasets coming from your organization, so they should also be as general as possible. **Resource** and **Catalogue item** will be created for each dataset automatically when the data is transferred via SFTP. \n\n### Step 3: Establishing a secure SSH connection with CSC\n\nTo prepare for the data transfer, we first need to establish a secure ssh connection between your laptop with CSC. Please follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an SSH key pair in **RSA** format via command line. [See detailed instructions](../../cloud/tutorials/ssh-key.md#creating-an-ssh-key-pair-on-a-computer) Do not use a password for your SSH key, leave this field empty.\n2. Log in to [the Sensitive Data user administration portal](https://admin.sd.csc.fi/). If you don't have HAKA or Virtu accounts, please write to our helpdesk to ask for a CSC account. Setting up an account takes few days.\n\n[![Sensitive Data user administration login](images/apply/SUP_Login.png)](images/apply/SUP_Login.png)\n\n\n3. In the administration portal, you add your public SSH key and a defined name (example: your organization and date) for it. \n4. Add the IP address from which the data will be transferred and a defined name for it (e.g.: organization-date). IP address can be checked with [CSC’s My IP app](https://apps.csc.fi/myip/).\n\n\n5. Next, please write to service desk (reply to same email thread) informing that these steps have been completed.\n\nWe will approve your account access to the secure connection and confirm it to you via email. Only at this point, you can test if is it is possible establishing a secure SSH connection with CSC by using this command and your SSH key:\n\n```\nsftp -i X:\\folder\\privateshhfilename.key -P 50527 username@org.fi@porin.lega.csc.fi\nexit\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n```\n-X:\\folder\\privateshhfilename.key is the path to the correspondent private shh key\n```\n\n`username` is the username visible in [the user administration portal](https://admin.sd.csc.fi/) and `org.fi` is the same as in your email address.\n\n\n[![SDS User administration](images/apply/SUP.png)](images/apply/SUP.png)\n\n\n### Step 4: Encrypt and upload the files via the secure connection\n\n\nYou can now encrypt and transfer the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
