In the following, two tools are presented: the\n[Stack Trace Analysis Tool][1] (STAT) and the [Abnormal Termination\nProcessing][2] (ATP). Both tools rely on the analysis of the stack backtrace to\ndetermine where the application is stalled or view where the application was at\nthe time of the crash.\nSee also the Cray documentation page about [debugging tools in Cray Programming Environment](https://cpe.ext.hpe.com/docs/#debugging-tools).\n\n## STAT: The Stack Trace Analysis Tool\n\nThe Stack Trace Analysis Tool (STAT) is a highly scalable, lightweight tool\nthat gathers and merges stack traces[^1] from all the processes of a\nparallel application. STAT is most effective for diagnosing parallel\napplications that are hung, i.e. suffers from a deadlock[^2] or livelock[^3].\n\n## Cray ATP: Abnormal Termination Processing\n\nThe Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a tool that monitors a running\nprogram. In the event of a fatal signal encountered by the program, ATP will\nhandle the signal and perform analysis on the dying application.\n\n### Usage\n\nUsing ATP requires that the target application is built with debug symbols\n(`-g` compiler flag).\n\nThe next step is to set the `ATP_ENABLED` environment variable in you batch\nscript. It's also recommended to set the maximum size of core files to\n`unlimited`.\n\n```bash\nmodule load atp\n\nexport ATP_ENABLED=1\nulimit â€“c unlimited\n\nsrun <srun_options> ./application\n```\n\n[THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN]: <> (### Viewing the Results)\n\n[^1]: A stack trace represents a call stack at a certain point in time, listing\n      the function calls that lead up to the call that caused a problem.\n[^2]: Deadlock is a situation when two threads (or processes) are waiting for\n      each other and the waiting is never ending.\n[^3]: Livelock occurs when two or more processes continually repeat the same\n      interaction in response to changes in the other processes without doing\n      any useful work.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
