`sbatch example_job.sh`\n- List all your jobs that are queuing/running:\n   - `squeue -u $USER`\n- Detailed info of a queuing/running job:\n   - `scontrol show job <jobid>`\n- A job can be deleted using the command:\n   - `scancel <jobid>`\n- Display the resource usage and efficiency of a completed job:\n   - `seff <jobid>`\n\n# Available batch job partitions\n\n- [The available batch job partitions](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/batch-job-partitions/) are listed in Docs CSC\n   - The Slurm partitions available on LUMI are detailed in the [LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/partitions/).\n- In order to use the resources efficiently, it is important to estimate the resource request as accurately as possible\n- By avoiding excessive \"just-in-case\" requests, the job will start earlier\n\n# Different types of HPC jobs\n\n- Typically, an HPC job can be classified as serial, parallel or GPU, depending on the main requested resources\n- The following slides will present an overview of different job types\n- A serial job is the simplest type of job, whereas parallel and GPU jobs require advanced software and programming methods to fully utilise their capacity\n   - Note that GPU-jobs are in principle also parallel, but they run on different hardware (GPUs instead of CPUs) and are programmed differently\n- If you use pre-installed applications, please ensure what kind of resources they need to run efficiently (serial, parallel or GPU)\n\n# HPC serial jobs\n\n- A serial software can only use a single core, so don't reserve more!\n- Why could your serial job benefit from being run using CSC's resources instead of on your own computer?\n    - Part of a larger workflow (high-throughput computing)\n    - Avoid data transfer between the supercomputers and your own computer\n    - Data sharing among other project members\n    - CSC's software licensing\n    - Pre-installed software\n    - Memory and/or disk demands\n\n# Running multiple serial jobs\n\n- You can utilize HPC resources for running multiple independent serial jobs at the same time (task farming)\n    - [Array jobs](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/array-jobs/)\n    - [Other high-throughput tools](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/throughput/)\n- Pure serial resources are only available in Puhti\n    - Some tools, e.g. [HyperQueue](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/hyperqueue/), can make a set of serial jobs suitable for Mahti\n    - **But**, the workflow needs to fill (at least) one Mahti node and keep the CPUs busy for the job duration\n- When running many jobs, make sure that you don't overload the batch queue system or the parallel file system (mind your I/O and job steps)!\n\n# HPC parallel jobs\n\n- A parallel job distributes the calculation over several cores in order to achieve a shorter wall-time (and/or a larger allocatable memory)\n   - The total computational problem is divided into subtasks, which are processed by each core in parallel\n- There are two major parallelization standards: [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) and [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface)\n   - Note, depending on the parallellization scheme there is a slight difference between _how_ the resource reservation is done\n- Batch job scripts for Puhti ([how to create](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/) and [examples](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/example-job-scripts-puhti/)), Mahti ([how to create](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-mahti/) and [examples](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/example-job-scripts-mahti/)) and LUMI ([quickstart](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/slurm-quickstart/), [CPU](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumic-job/) and [GPU examples](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumig-job/))\n- **The best starting point:** [Software specific batch scripts in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)\n\n# HPC GPU jobs\n\n- A graphics processing unit (GPU, a graphics card), is capable of doing a certain type of simultaneous calculations _very_ efficiently\n- In order to take advantage of this power, an application must be (re)programmed to adapt to how the GPUs process data\n- CSC's GPU resources on Puhti and Mahti are relatively scarce and should be used only by applications [that really benefit from GPUs](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/#gpu-nodes)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
