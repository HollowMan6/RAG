A single CSC\n    computing project can have access to multiple projects in Rahti 2.\n    Each CSC computing project with access to Rahti will have a corresponding *group* in\n    Rahti 2.\n\nAll projects in Rahti 2 must be mapped to a CSC computing project. This\nmapping is used to determine which CSC computing project a given resource\nbelongs to for billing and other purposes. You need to\nspecify which of them to use. You have to specify which project to map by entering `csc_project:` followed\nby the name or number of your CSC computing project in the _Description_ field\nwhen creating a new project in Rahti 2. You can also enter other text in the\ndescription field if you want to have a human-readable description for\nthe project you are creating.\n\nFor example, if you have Rahti 2 access via *project_1000123*, you would\nenter the following in the _Description_ field:\n\n```yaml\ncsc_project: 1000123\n```\n\nYou can also enter a human-readable description for the project, in which case\nthe field could look like this:\n\n```yaml\nThis project is used for hosting the Pied Piper web application.\n\ncsc_project: 1000123\n```\n\nThis would make it so that any usage within that Rahti 2 project is billed\nto the billing unit quota of project_1000123. Note that project_1000123 must\nhave Rahti service access and you must be a member of that computing project,\nor the OpenShift project creation will fail.\n\nIf you would like to know which CSC computing projects you are a member of, you\ncan view a list in the [My Projects\ntool](https://my.csc.fi/projects) of MyCSC. \n\nIf you would like to know which CSC computing project a Rahti 2 project is\nassociated with, you can do so using the _oc_ command line tool. You can find\ninstructions for setting up oc in the [command line tool usage\ninstructions ](cli.md). For example, if your Rahti 2 project is called\n*my-openshift-project*, you would run:\n\n```bash\noc get project my-openshift-project -o yaml\n```\n\nThis should produce the following output:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1\nkind: Project\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    ...\n  creationTimestamp: 2018-11-22T12:27:05Z\n  labels:\n    csc_project: \"1000123\"\n  name: my-openshift-project\n  resourceVersion: \"72557736\"\n  selfLink: /apis/project.openshift.io/v1/projects/my-openshift-project\n  uid: df4970e2-abd7-4417-adbf-531293c68cd6\nspec:\n  finalizers:\n  - openshift.io/origin\n  - kubernetes\nstatus:\n  phase: Active\n```\n\nIn the output above, you can find the associated CSC computing project under\n`metadata.labels.csc_project`. In this case, the project is `1000123`.\nThis information is also available via a web interface.\n\n![Labels web UI](../../img/Labels-webui.png)\n\n!!! info\n\n    It is not possible for normal users to change the *csc_project* label\n    after a project has been created. If you would like to change the label for\n    an existing project, please [contact the support](../../../support/contact.md). You can also create\n    a completely new project if you want to use a different label.\n\n## Creating a project\n\nFirst, click this [link](https://rahti.csc.fi/) to access the homepage of Rahti 2 and click **Login Page** under *OpenShift 4.15*.  \n\nAfter being logged in, click the blue \"Create Project\" button to create a project, and you will be presented with the following view:\n\n![OpenShift new project dialog](../../img/new_project_dialog_4.png)\n\nIf you are in \"Developer\" view, click on \"Projects: All projects\" located in the topbar and \"Create Project\":\n![OpenShift new project dialog Developer](../../img/new_project_dialog_4_developer.png)  \n\n1. You *need* to pick a **unique name** that is not in use by any other project\nin the system.\n1. You *can* also enter a **human-readable display name** and.\n1. You *have to* also enter a **CSC computing project** in the _Description_ field. It must be a currently valid CSC project, that your account has access to. In order to view to which CSC projects you have access to, please check <https://my.csc.fi>. If you have access to no CSC project, you will not be able to create any Rahti 2 project. If you have Rahti 2 access via project_1000123, you would enter the following in the Description field:\n\n> csc_project: 1000123\n\n![OpenShift Create Project](../../img/create_project_dialog_4.png)\n\nSee the section about [accounts](../../../accounts/index.md).\n\nOnce you have filled in the fields, click \"Create\", and you will see the application\ncatalog where you can pick an application template or import your\nown one.\n\nFor more information about using the web interface, refer to the\n[official OpenShift documentation](https://docs.okd.io/) (our current version is 4.15).
