It aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [Boost Software License 1.0](https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/tophat/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Available\n\n-   Puhti: 2.1.1\n-   [Chipster](https://chipster.csc.fi) graphical user interface\n\n## Usage\n\nOn Puhti, TopHat is initialized with the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nThe biokit module sets up a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools, including Bowtie2, TopHat2 and Cufflinks.\n\nTophat jobs should be run as batch jobs. Below is a sample batch job file for running a TopHat job on Puhti:\n\n```bash\n!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=tophat\n#SBATCH --output=out_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=err_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --mem=16G\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --account=project_1234567\n\nmodule load biokit\ntophat -p $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -o tophat_results Homo.sapiens_bwt2_index reads1.fq reads2.fq \n```\n\nIn the batch job example above, one task (`--ntasks=1`) is executed. The job uses 4 cores (`--cpus-per-task=4`) with 16 GB of memory (`--mem=16G`). The maximum duration of the job is 24 hours (`--time=24:00:00`). Change `--account` to match your own project name.\n\nNote that we also need to tell TopHat to use the number of cores we reserved. In Tophat, this is done with the `-p` command-line argument. We can use system variable `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` to automatically match the reservation made with `--cpus-per-task`. This way we don't need to change the command-line if we change the reservation.\n\nSee the [Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md) for more information about running batch jobs.\n\n## Support\n\n[CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md)\n\n## More information\n\n* [TopHat Homepage](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml)\n* [TopHat Manual](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/manual.shtml)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TOPHAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TopHat is a software tool for mapping RNA-Seq reads to a genome and identifying splice junctions)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWTIE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bowtie is an ultra high-throughput short read aligner used by TopHat for aligning RNA-Seq reads to genomes)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment where TopHat version 2.1.1 is available for use)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIPSTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chipster is a graphical user interface that provides access to TopHat among other bioinformatics tools)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOKIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Biokit is a module on Puhti that sets up a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools including Bowtie2, TopHat2, and Cufflinks)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUFFLINKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cufflinks is a software tool included in the Biokit module on Puhti, used for analyzing RNA-Seq data)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC Service Desk provides support for users of TopHat and other services on Puhti)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPHAT<|>BOWTIE<|>TopHat uses Bowtie for aligning RNA-Seq reads to genomes<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPHAT<|>PUHTI<|>TopHat version 2.1.1 is available on Puhti<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPHAT<|>CHIPSTER<|>TopHat can be accessed through the Chipster graphical user interface<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPHAT<|>BIOKIT<|>TopHat is included in the Biokit module on Puhti<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOKIT<|>CUFFLINKS<|>Biokit includes Cufflinks among other bioinformatics tools<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPHAT<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>CSC Service Desk provides support for TopHat users<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>CSC Service Desk supports users on Puhti, where TopHat is available<|>5)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
