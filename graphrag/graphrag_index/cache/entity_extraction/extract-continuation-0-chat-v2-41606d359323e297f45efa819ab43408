There are a lot of other \"base images\" in `docker.io/library`, such as `ubuntu` or `alpine`.\n\n* Finally, it is the tag, `latest`. This is the default tag for an image, but an image can have any given name for a tag. This is used to differentiate between version of the same image. Examples for `nginx` are: `stable`, `perl`, `1.25.3-perl`, and lots more. The contents of a given tag can change with time, `latest` will be always the most updated version. But other tags are left unchanged after they are released.\n\n\nOfficial page of [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) on Docker hub provide us more details how different tagged versions of official nginx image is build.\n\n## Advanced image internals\n\nMany times author of Docker images don't necessarily provide details of Dockerfile which were used to build Docker images. It is therefore good idea to inspect images from unknown sources. You can see the detailed information of image internal using `docker inspect`. The output is a JSON object, that can be processed using standard tools like `jq`, see an example at the bottom of this page.\n\nThis allows to see interesting data about the image, like the environment, the entry point, initial command, the layers, and many more.\n\n```bash\n$ docker inspect nginx\n[\n    {\n        \"Id\": \"sha256:81be38025439476d1b7303cb575df80e419fd1b3be4a639f3b3e51cf95720c7b\",\n        \"RepoTags\": [\n            \"nginx:latest\",\n            \"image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi/tristan-tests/nginx-is:latest\"\n        ],\n        \"RepoDigests\": [\n            \"nginx@sha256:86e53c4c16a6a276b204b0fd3a8143d86547c967dc8258b3d47c3a21bb68d3c6\",\n        ],\n        \"Parent\": \"\",\n        \"Comment\": \"\",\n        \"Created\": \"2023-11-01T13:52:55.281520995Z\",\n        \"Container\": \"3082c1b3b5eb0938cb1973e01eee5a137819918bdf18672e4c831f63d7910708\",\n        \"ContainerConfig\": {\n            \"Hostname\": \"3082c1b3b5eb\",\n            \"Domainname\": \"\",\n            \"User\": \"\",\n            \"AttachStdin\": false,\n            \"AttachStdout\": false,\n            \"AttachStderr\": false,\n            \"ExposedPorts\": {\n                \"80/tcp\": {}\n            },\n            \"Tty\": false,\n            \"OpenStdin\": false,\n            \"StdinOnce\": false,\n            \"Env\": [\n                \"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\",\n                \"NGINX_VERSION=1.25.3\",\n                \"NJS_VERSION=0.8.2\",\n                \"PKG_RELEASE=1~bookworm\"\n            ],\n            \"Cmd\": [\n                \"/bin/sh\",\n                \"-c\",\n                \"#(nop) \",\n                \"CMD [\\\"nginx\\\" \\\"-g\\\" \\\"daemon off;\\\"]\"\n            ],\n            \"Image\": \"sha256:f5bb00b8bc235e00779e82f457d2675944d51e7fe463e94e74090f5ce323477a\",\n            \"Volumes\": null,\n            \"WorkingDir\": \"\",\n            \"Entrypoint\": [\n                \"/docker-entrypoint.sh\"\n            ],\n            \"OnBuild\": null,\n            \"Labels\": {\n                \"maintainer\": \"NGINX Docker Maintainers <docker-maint@nginx.com>\"\n            },\n            \"StopSignal\": \"SIGQUIT\"\n        },\n        \"DockerVersion\": \"20.10.23\",\n        \"Author\": \"\",\n        \"Config\": {\n            \"Hostname\": \"\",\n            \"Domainname\": \"\",\n            \"User\": \"\",\n            \"AttachStdin\": false,\n            \"AttachStdout\": false,\n            \"AttachStderr\": false,\n            \"ExposedPorts\": {\n                \"80/tcp\": {}\n            },\n            \"Tty\": false,\n            \"OpenStdin\": false,\n            \"StdinOnce\": false,\n            \"Env\": [\n                \"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\",\n                \"NGINX_VERSION=1.25.3\",\n                \"NJS_VERSION=0.8.2\",\n                \"PKG_RELEASE=1~bookworm\"\n            ],\n            \"Cmd\": [\n                \"nginx\",\n                \"-g\",\n                \"daemon off;\"\n            ],\n            \"Image\": \"sha256:f5bb00b8bc235e00779e82f457d2675944d51e7fe463e94e74090f5ce323477a\",\n            \"Volumes\": null,\n            \"WorkingDir\": \"\",\n            \"Entrypoint\": [\n                \"/docker-entrypoint.sh\"\n            ],\n            \"OnBuild\": null,\n            \"Labels\": {\n                \"maintainer\": \"NGINX Docker Maintainers <docker-maint@nginx.com>\"\n            },\n            \"StopSignal\": \"SIGQUIT\"\n        },\n        \"Architecture\": \"arm64\",\n        \"Variant\": \"v8\",\n        \"Os\": \"linux\",\n        \"Size\": 192076209,\n        \"VirtualSize\": 192076209,\n        \"GraphDriver\": {\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NGINX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NGINX is a software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more.
