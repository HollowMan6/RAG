The InterProScan5 installation at CSC can\nbe used to search protein signatures from following databases:\n\n   * TIGRFAM (15.0)\n   * SFLD (4)\n   * SUPERFAMILY (1.75)\n   * PANTHER (15.0)\n   * Gene3D (4.3.0)\n   * Hamap (2020_05)\n   * Coils (2.2.1)\n   * ProSiteProfiles (2021_01)\n   * SMART (7.1)\n   * CDD (3.18)\n   * PRINTS (42.0)\n   * PIRSR (2021_05)\n   * ProSitePatterns (2021_01)\n   * AntiFam (7.0)\n   * Pfam (34.0)\n   * MobiDBLite (2.0)\n   * PIRSF (3.10)\n\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\n## Available\n\n*   Puhti: 5.55-88.0, 5.67-90.0\n\n## Usage\n\nIn Puhti, first load interproscan module with commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\nmodule load interproscan\n```\n\nAfter that you can submit  InterProScan jobs using command `cluster_interproscan`. Cluster_interproscan\nis a help tool that automatically runs your InterProScan task using the batch job system of Puhti.\nIf your query file contains several sequences the cluster_interproscan tool also automatically splits\nthe InterProScan tasks to several subtasks that are run simultaneously in Puhti.\n\ncluster_interproscan accepts all the normal InterProScan options. To check the available options, give command:\n\n```bash\ncluster_interproscan -h\n```\n\nBelow is two sample InterProScan commands\n\n1. Running InterProScan search for a nucleotide sequence set  against all InterProScan databases.\nResults are reported in XML format.\n\n```bash\ncluster_interproscan -i nucleotides.fasta -o results.xml -f XML -t n\n```\n\n2. Running InterProScan search for protein sequence set against PfamA databases. Results are reported in GFF3 format. GFF3 conversion needs more memory that what is available in the login nodes of Puhti. Because of that you should submit the interporosacn task from an interactive batch job with least 4 GiB of memory reserved.\n\n```bash\nsinteractive -m 4000\ncluster_interproscan -i proteins.fasta -o results.gff3 -f GFF3 -appl PfamA\n```\n\n\n## More information\n\n*   [InterPro home page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
