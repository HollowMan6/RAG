A NumForce job spawns `3*N*2` (`N` = number of atoms) independent\ngradient calculations.  Usually it is most efficient that the single gradient\ncalculations are run as serial (`unset PARA_ARCH`). Each serial calculation is\nexpected to take roughly the same time, hence optimally the total number of\ngradient calculations should be an integer multiple of the allocated cores.\n\nA NumForce step in a job file:\n\n```bash\nunset PARA_ARCH\nexport HOSTS_FILE=$PWD/turbomole.machines\nrm -f $HOSTS_FILE\nsrun hostname > $HOSTS_FILE\nulimit -s unlimited\nkdg tmpdir\nNumForce -ri -central -mfile $HOSTS_FILE > NumForce.out\n```\n\n## References\n\nPlease quote the usage of the program package under consideration of the\nversion number:\n\n- TURBOMOLE V7.8, a development of University of Karlsruhe and\n  Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, 1989-2007, TURBOMOLE GmbH, since 2007;\n  available from https://www.turbomole.org\n- A review article should be mentioned, as well:\n  https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0004635\n- Scientific publications require proper citation of methods and procedures\n  employed.
