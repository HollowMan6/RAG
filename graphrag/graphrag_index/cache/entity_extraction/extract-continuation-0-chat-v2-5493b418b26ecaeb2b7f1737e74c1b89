However, you have to first build or download an Apptainer container elsewhere, and then use _Allas/SD Connect_ to import the container to SD Desktop.\n\nNote: Apptainer is a fork on Singularity container system, so in many occasions instructions may refer to Singularity. In most cases you can just replace \"Singularity\" with \"Apptainer\".\n\nIf you have root access to a machine with Apptainer, you can build your own container that contains exactly the software and datasets you need. Many software are also available as ready-made Apptainer containers or as Docker containers that can be converted into\nAppainer containers. In this document we show how to import a ready-made Apptaner container from a public repository to SD Desktop.\n\n\n## Step by step tutorial\n\n*Before you start, please activate services **Puhti, SD Desktop** and **Allas/SD Connect** for your project. This happens in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/login){ target=\"_blank\" }.*\n\n<iframe width=\"562\" height=\"316\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-_pSrRu4-c\" title=\"Utilizing Apptainer containers in SD Desktop\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nHow to import a ready-made Apptainer container from a public repository to SD Desktop:\n\n1. [Find a suitable container](#find-a-suitable-container)\n2. [Download the container](#download-the-container)\n3. [Upload the container to SD Connect](#upload-the-container-to-allas-sd-connect)\n4. [Download the container to SD Desktop](#using-a-container-in-sd-desktop)\n\n### Importing ready-made container through Puhti\n\n#### Find a suitable container\nIn the example below we import [BETA Binding and Expression Target Analysis](https://cistrome.org/BETA/index.html) software to SD Desktop.\nThis tool is available as a ready-made Apptainer container in [Biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/registry) repository. You can find the tool by searching for _Binding and Expression Target Analysis_ in the repository. When you open the detailed information of the resulting _cistrome_beta_ container, \nyou can see that the Singularity module can be downloaded from URL: <https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/cistrome_beta:1.0.7--py27heb79e2c_4>\n\n#### Download the container\nAs we don't need to build the container from scratch, we can use [puhti.csc.fi](../../computing/index.md) server to download the container image and push it to Allas.\n\nFirst [login to puhti.csc.fi](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/public/){ target=\"_blank\" }. Then, start an interactive batch job session with command:\n\n```text\nsinteractive\n```\n\nIn the interactive session move to `LOCAL_SCRATCH` directory and set some Singularity related environment variables:\n\n```text\nexport SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH\nexport SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH\nunset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\n```\n\nThen download a local copy of the Beta container with command\n\n```text\napptainer pull beta.sif https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/cistrome_beta:1.0.7--py27heb79e2c_4\n```\n\nThis creates a new singularity container file, `beta.sif`. From the home page of BETA software \nwe download also a test data set for confirming that the container works.\n\n```text\nwget http://cistrome.org/BETA/src/BETA_test_data.zip\n```\n\n#### Upload the container to Allas / SD Connect\n\nThen we upload these two files to Allas/SD Connect. In this example we use project _2012345_.\n\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf project_2012345\na-put --sdx beta.sif -b 2012345_beta\na-put --sdx BETA_test_data.zip -b 2012345_beta\n```\n\nThe commands above store the files into bucket `2012345_beta` in Allas. `a-put` is used with option `--sdx` in order to encrypt the uploaded data with SD Desktop compatible encryption. \n\n### Using a container in SD Desktop\n\nFirst [login to sd-desktop.csc.fi](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi/){ target=\"_blank\" } and open your virtual desktop session.\n\nOnce the `.sif` formatted Apptainer container file and the sample data has been uploaded to Allas, we can copy \nthem to SD Desktop. To do this open _DataGateway_, in your session SD Desktop. After that copy the data to local disk in SD Desktop.\n\nYou can do that using the **graphical DataGateway tool** on the Desktop (see the [video](https://youtu.be/6-_pSrRu4-c?t=397){ target=\"_blank\" }).\n\nOr you can use **Linux command line**: Open a Linux terminal in the SD-Desktop. In the terminal, move the Apptainer file and test data to your current locations:\n\n```text\ncp Projects/SD\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer is a software container tool used to add new software to SD Desktop environments, requiring the build or download of containers elsewhere before importing via Allas/SD Connect)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Desktop is a computing environment not directly connected to the internet, utilizing tools like Apptainer for software installation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS/SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service used in conjunction with SD Desktop to import Apptainer containers and other data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A server used to download Apptainer container images and push them to Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETA BINDING AND EXPRESSION TARGET ANALYSIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool available as a ready-made Apptainer container for importing into SD Desktop)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOCONTAINERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A repository where ready-made Apptainer containers, such as BETA software, can be found)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>SD DESKTOP<|>Apptainer containers are used to add new software to SD Desktop environments<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ALLAS/SD CONNECT<|>Allas/SD Connect is used to import Apptainer containers into SD Desktop<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS/SD CONNECT<|>Puhti server is used to download and push Apptainer containers to Allas/SD Connect<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETA BINDING AND EXPRESSION TARGET ANALYSIS<|>BIOCONTAINERS<|>BETA software is available as an Apptainer container in the Biocontainers repository<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETA BINDING AND EXPRESSION TARGET ANALYSIS<|>SD DESKTOP<|>BETA software, as an Apptainer container, is intended for use in SD Desktop environments<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
