However if you you need to have direct access to your data in the HPC servers, you can use `sshfs` to create a temporary remote mounts for your personal directories in Puhti or Mahti.\n\nFor example, if user _kkayttaj_ would like to mount his scratch directory (/scratch/project_2012345) from Puhti to a Ubuntu based virtual machine running in cPouta, he would first need to install sshfs too to the virtual machine:\n\n```\nsudo apt install sshfs\n```\nIn Centos machines the corresponding command is:\n\n```text\nsudo yum install sshfs\n```\n\nAfter that, an empty directory is created to be used as a mount point:\n\n```\nmkdir puhti_scratch\n```\n\nNext the mounting is done with command:\n\n```\nsshfs kkayttaj@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_2012345 ./puhti_scratch\n```\n\n(Here, you should replace /scratch/project_2012345 with the scratch directory of your project).\n\nAfter this, directory _puhti_scratch_ shows the content of scratch in Puhti and it can be used as any mounted directory. However, the I/O performance of the remotely mounted directories is not as good as locally mounted directories. Because of that, in the case of I/O intensive tasks it may be more reasonable to copy the data to the local disks of the virtual machine. Tools like `scp` and `rsync` can be used for that.\n\nTo _**unmount**_; the file system, give a command:\n\n```\nfusermount -u mountpoint\n```\n\nFor example the remote mount created above, would be removed with commands:\n\n```\nfusermount -u puhti_scratch\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
