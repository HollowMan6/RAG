In the case of this argument, array `$0` refers to the name of the\nactual script, `$1` refers to the first arguments, `$2` to the second and so\non. `$#` refers to the number of arguments and `$@` to the full argument\nlist. Below is a sample script that illustrates using the `$` array\nvariable:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfrom_dir=$1\nto_dir=$2\nmkdir $to_dir\ncp $from_dir/*.map $to_dir\n```\n\nIf we now execute this script, named e.g. `my_script2.sh`, we have to\ngive two arguments for the command. The first argument is in this case\nused to define a source directory for the copy command while the second\nargument is the target directory. For example, the command\n\n```bash\n./my_script2.csh source_data map_files\n```\n\nwould copy all the file with extension `.map` from a directory called\n`source_data` to a new directory called `map_files`.\n\n## Quotation marks\n\nThree different quotation marks are used in bash. Quotation marks are\nfrequently needed to define variables and commands to be executed.\nFollowing quotation marks can be used:\n\n- ` \"\" ` Take text within quotes literally after substituting any\n  variables\n- ` '' ` Take text enclosed within quotes literally\n- ` `` ` Take text enclosed within quotes as a command, execute the\n  command and then replace with output of the command at the location\n  of quotation marks\n\nBelow are some examples to illustrate the functional differences of\ndifferent quotation marks. Quotation marks can be used to operate with\nvariables and arguments. When the double or single quotation marks are\nused, all the text inside the quotation marks are used as one\nargument. The difference between these two quotation marks is that\nwhen double quotation marks are used, variables are substituted by their\nvalues, while with single quotation all text is used as it is. If you\nrun the commands\n\n```bash\nvariable=sample1\necho \"value = $variable\"\n```\n\nthe result will be\n\n```bash\nvalue = sample1\n```\n\nBut if you use single quotation marks instead\n\n```bash\necho 'value = $variable'\n```\n\nyou will get output\n\n```bash\nvalue = $variable\n```\n\nIn Linux commands and scripts quotation marks are typically used to\ndefine arguments that contain spaces or other special characters. Say we\nwould like to use `grep` to pick all rows that contain a string\n`file size` from a file called `files.txt`. The following command **would\nnot work**:\n\n```bash\ngrep file size files.txt\n```\n\nIf you run the command above, you'll get an error message, as the word\n*size* is now interpreted to be the second argument defining the input\nfile. We can fix the situation by using quotation marks:\n\n```bash\ngrep \"file size\" files.txt\n```\n\nNow, the first argument defining the string to be searched is `file\nsize` (including the space between the words), and the second argument\ndefining the input file is now `files.txt` as originally intended.\n\nThe third quotation mark type ` `` ` has a special meaning. With these\nquotation marks, you can make one Linux command produce an argument\nfor another Linux command. The basic syntax ` `` ` is:\n\n```bash\ncommand1 `command2`\n```\n\nwhere `command1` will use the product of `command2` as an argument. In\na bash script, the same functionality can be done also with the syntax\n\n```bash\n$(command)\n```\n\n## Loops and conditional statements\n\nLoops and conditional statements are rarely used in interactive command-line\nusage. However, they are frequently used in scripts to perform\nsimilar commands several times and to control the commands to be\nexecuted. Bash provides a wide selection loops, conditional statements\nand other control structures. In this section, we show examples of some\nof the most commonly used control structures.\n\nA *for* loop performs specified commands iteratively so that\non each iteration the loop variable is set to be equal to one of the\nitems in the given element list. In bash, a for loop is made with command\nstructure:\n\n```bash\nfor variable in element_list\ndo\n   commands\ndone\n```\n\nFor example, the loop\n\n```bash\nfor filename in sample1.txt sample2.txt sample3.txt\ndo\n   echo ${filename}\ndone\n```\n\nwould print out\n\n```text\nsample1.txt\nsample2.txt\nsample3.txt\n```\n\nTypically, the argument list contains file names to be processed, but it\ncan also be any other parameter too. For example, say we have a\ndirectory called `project_3` that contains nine files called\n`sample1.txt`, `sample2.txt`, ..., `sample9.txt`. To see the contents of\nthe directory, we may use command `ls`:\n\n```bash\n$ ls project_3/\nsample1.txt sample3.txt sample5.txt sample7.txt sample9.txt  \nsample2.txt sample4.txt sample6.txt sample8.txt  \n```\n\nIf we would like to rename each of these files so that they have\nthe extension `.old`, we could run command `mv` nine times, or we could use a\nfor loop:\n\n```bash\nfor filename in sample1.txt sample2.txt sample3.txt sample4.txt \\\nsample5.txt sample6.txt sample7.txt sample8.txt sample9.txt\ndo\n   echo \"Renaming file: ${filename}\"\n   mv project\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
