It aligns short DNA sequences (reads) \nto the human genome at a rate of over 25 million 35-bp reads per hour. Bowtie2 indexes the genome \nwith a Burrows-Wheeler index to keep its memory footprint small: typically about 2.2 GB for the \nhuman genome (2.9 GB for paired-end).\n\nThere are two versions of Bowtie available: Bowtie2 and Bowtie. The more recent Bowtie2 program differs \nsignificantly from its ancestor Bowtie. For example the command line options are different for these two tools.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\n\n## Available\n\n-   Puhti: 2.3.5.1, 2.4.1, 2.4.4, 2.5.3\n-   Chipster graphical user interface\n\n## Usage\n\nOn Puhti, Bowtie2 can be taken in use as part of the `biokit` module collection:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nThe biokit module sets up a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools, including Bowtie2. Note however that there are other bioinformatics tools on Puhti,\nthat have a separate setup command.\n\nIn a typical Bowtie2 run, you first need to index the reference genome with `bowtie2-build` command. You should do this in scratch directory instead of your \nhome directory. For example;\n\n```bash\nbowtie2-build genome.fa genome\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `chipster_genomes` command to download pre-calculated bowtie2 indexes from the CSC Chipster server to Puhti:\n\n```bash\nchipster_genomes bowtie2\n``` \n\nWhen the reference genome has been downloaded or indexed, the actual alignment job can be launched with `bowtie2` command. For example, for single end reads, this could be done with the command:\n\n```bash\nbowtie2 -x genome -U reads.fq -S output.sam\n```\n\nFor paired end data, the minimal Bowtie2 syntax is:\n\n```bash\nbowtie2 -x genome -1 first_read_set.fq -2 second_read_set.fq -S output.sam\n``` \n\n### Example batch script for Puhti\n\nOn Puhti, `bowtie` and `bowtie2` jobs should be run as batch jobs. Below is a sample batch job file, \nfor running a Bowtie2 paired end alignment on Puhti. The recent Bowtie2 versions scale well, so you can effectively use up \nto 16 cores in your batch job.\n\nNote that the batch job file must define the project that will be used.\nYou can check all the projects that you belong to with the command `groups` or\n`csc-projects`. Use [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) to obtain more specific information about a\nspecific project.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=bowtie2\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=04:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n#SBATCH --account=project_123456\n#SBATCH --mem=16000\n\nmodule load biokit\nbowtie2-build genome.fasta genome\nbowtie2 -p $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -x genome -1 reads_1.fq -2 reads_2.fq > output.sam\n```\n\nIn the batch job example above one task (`--ntasks=1`) is executed. The Bowtie2 job uses 16 cores (`--cpus-per-task=16`) with total of 16 GB of memory (`--mem=16000`). \nThe maximum duration of the job is four hours (`--time=04:00:00`).\nAll the cores are assigned from one computing node (`--nodes=1`).\nIn the example, the project that will be used is `project_123456`. This value should be replaced by the name of your computing project.\n\nYou can submit the batch job file to the batch job system with command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file.bash\n```\n\nSee the [Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md) for more information about running batch jobs.\n\n## References\n\nWhen you use Bowtie2, please cite:\n\n> Langmead B, Salzberg S.
