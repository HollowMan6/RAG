It has been developed as a turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulation\n(LES) model that is especially designed for performing on massively parallel computer\narchitectures.\n\nThe PALM model system has been mainly developed and is maintained by the ​PALM group at the\n​[Institute of Meteorology and Climatology (IMUK)](https://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/?&L=1) of\nLeibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. A number of code parts have been contributed by national\n(German) and international work groups.\n\n## License\n\nThe PALM model system is free software. It can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms\nof the GNU General Public License (v3)(https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\n\n## Available\n\nPALM is available on [Puhti, Mahti and LUMI](../computing/available-systems.md) servers. Versions\navailable are listed when running the installation script, see below.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter login on the server, give the command\n\n```bash\nmodule spider palm\n```\n\nThis gives you a list of the installed versions. To load the version of your choice, give the command\n\n```bash\nmodule load palm/<version>\n```\n\nOn LUMI, you need to first load the module environment\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule spider palm\nmodule load palm/<version>\n```\n\nLink to read the instruction file is created,\n\n```bash\nreadme_palm_csc\n```\n\nalong with link to the command to run the installation script\n\n```bash\ninstallPalm\n```\n\nIt is recommended to read first the instruction file, especially to understand on which disk\npartition on the server the installation should be done (i.e., where to run the installation\nscript).\n\nAn example test case input file is included in the installation. In the instruction\nfile, run commands are given for compilation of the code, and for batch job execution\nusing the example case. For more information about the test case execution, see the latest\n[PALM tutorials](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/tut/palm#Exercisepresentations).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter problems using PALM, [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\n## More information\n\n* [The PALM model system](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac)\n* [PALM documentation](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc)\n* [PALM movie gallery](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/gallery/movies)\n* [PALM Tutorial](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/tut/palm#Exercisepresentations)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PALM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PALM is an advanced meteorological model system for atmospheric and oceanic boundary-layer flows, designed for large-eddy simulation (LES) and optimized for massively parallel computer architectures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTE OF METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY (IMUK)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Institute of Meteorology and Climatology at Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany, maintains the PALM model system and has contributed to its development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITÄT HANNOVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A German university where the Institute of Meteorology and Climatology is located and which contributes to the development and maintenance of the PALM model system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (V3)<|>EVENT<|>The license under which the PALM model system is distributed, allowing for free redistribution and modification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>One of the servers where PALM is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>One of the servers where PALM is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>One of the servers where PALM is available and requires loading a specific module environment before using PALM)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The support service for users encountering problems with PALM)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALM<|>INSTITUTE OF METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY (IMUK)<|>The PALM model system is mainly developed and maintained by the PALM group at the Institute of Meteorology and Climatology<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTE OF METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY (IMUK)<|>LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITÄT HANNOVER<|>The Institute of Meteorology and Climatology is part of Leibniz Universität Hannover<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALM<|>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (V3)<|>PALM is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (v3)<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALM<|>PUHTI<|>PALM is available on the Puhti server<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALM<|>MAHTI<|>PALM is available on the Mahti server<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALM<|>LUMI<|>PALM is available on the LUMI server, requiring specific module environment loading<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALM<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>Users of PALM can contact the CSC Service Desk for support<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
