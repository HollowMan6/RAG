Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

It can be used with several MD codes.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Available\n\n-   Puhti: 2.7.4, 2.8.0\n-   Mahti: 2.6.3, 2.7.2\n\n## License\n\nThe PLUMED license (L-GPL) also allows it to be interfaced with proprietary software.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe standalone module of PLUMED is for building your own applications and linking with\nPLUMED, or analysing results performed with such code. To use, first give `module spider`\nto locate all versions and their library dependencies:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider plumed\nmodule load <dependencies reported by the spider command> plumed/<version>\n```\n\nIf you want to run molecular dynamics with PLUMED, either compile your MD engine of\nchoice with PLUMED (see [selection e.g. here](https://www.plumed.org/)), or use e.g.\n[GROMACS](gromacs.md), which is available at CSC.\n\n## References\n\nCite your work with PLUMED with:\n\n```text\nThis work was carried out using the open-source, community-developed PLUMED library \n[1], version 2.x [2] (or alternatively version 1.x [3]).\n```\n\n[1] The PLUMED consortium. _Promoting transparency and reproducibility in enhanced\nmolecular simulations_, [Nat.
