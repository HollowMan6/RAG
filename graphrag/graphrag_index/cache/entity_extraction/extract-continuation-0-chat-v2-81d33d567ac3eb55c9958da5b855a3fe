Warning    \n    [I/O flavors](../../cloud/pouta/vm-flavors-and-billing.md#io-flavors_2) and [GPU flavors](../../cloud/pouta/vm-flavors-and-billing.md#gpu-flavors_2) cannot be resized to a different family flavors. We recommend to use [snapshots](../../cloud/pouta/snapshots.md#launching-an-instance-from-a-volume-snapshot).\n\n!!! Warning  \n    It's possible to resize from a `standard` flavor *family* to a `hpc` flavor *family*. Nothing will prevent you to do that but it's **highly not recommended!**  \n    You may lose data during the process and CSC is not responsible. We recommend to only resize to the flavors of the same *family* (except for I/O flavors, see above).\n\nIn the **Actions** menu of your instance, choose **Resize** to begin the process:  \n\n![resize-button](img/resize_button.png)\n\nA window will open. Select the new flavor:\n\n![resize-windows](img/resize_window.png)\n\nClick **Resize**\n\nWait few minutes and during the process, it will ask you to confirm the resize:\n\n![confirm-resize](img/confirm_resize.png)\n\n\nWhen your instance is in `Confirm Resize/Migrate` it means that you can connect to your instance to check if everything is working fine because it's already converted into the new flavor.  \nIn the case that you spot something wrong, you can revert to the previous state with the `Revert Resize/Migrate` button in the drop menu.  \n\n!!! error-label  \n    Be aware that an automatic confirm process will be triggered after three days of pending `Confirm or Revert Resize/Migrate` status\n\nAfter the process finished, you should have your instance with a new flavor.\n\n\n## Resize a volume\n!!! Notes  \n    You can only extend a volume. Currently, shrink a volume is not supported in Openstack.\n\nPouta let you create [external volumes](../../cloud/pouta/storage.md). If your initial volume is too small, you can resize it.\n\n!!! Note\n    If your volume is attached to your instance, you must detach it to be able to resize\n\nFrom the Volumes page, in the **Actions** menu, click **Extend Volume**:\n\n![resize-volume](img/resize_volume.png)\n\nA window will open. Enter the new amount of your volume:\n\n![resize-volume-window](img/resize_volume_window.png)\n\nClick **Extend Volume**\n\nYou should see the new size of your volume.\n\nYou can now attach the new volume back to your instance.\n\n## Customize disk size when creating the instance\n\nTo customize the root disk size during instance creation (instead of using a snapshot), follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to **Project > Compute > Instances** and click on **Launch Instance**.\n2. In the **Details** section:\n   - **Instance Name**: Enter a name for your instance.\n   - **Flavor**: Choose the appropriate flavor, such as `standard.tiny` (with default 80 GB disk space).\n   - **Instance Boot Source**: Choose **Boot from image (creates a new volume)**.\n   - **Image Name**: Select the image you want to use (e.g., AlmaLinux-8).\n   - **Device Size**: Adjust the size of the root volume to your desired size, as shown in the image (e.g., 200 GB instead of the default 80 GB).\n   \n   - This field allows you to customize the root volume size beyond the flavor's default disk size as shown in figure below.\n\n3. After configuring the rest of the options (security, networking, etc.), click **Launch**.\n\n![cloud_pouta_resize_custome_disk](img/cloud_pouta_resize_custome_disk.png)\n\nIf you'd like to extend the volume using a snapshot instead, please visit [Volume snapshots](../../cloud/pouta/snapshots.md#volume-snapshots) for more detailed instructions.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>POUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta offers cloud services including instance and volume resizing, snapshot management, and storage solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAPSHOT<|>EVENT<|>A snapshot is a method used in Pouta for creating a point-in-time copy of an instance, which can then be used to boot a new instance with a different flavor\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>I/O FLAVORS<|>EVENT<|>I/O flavors refer to a specific category of virtual machine configurations in Pouta that are optimized for high input/output operations per second\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPU FLAVORS<|>EVENT<|>GPU flavors are a category of virtual machine configurations in Pouta designed for graphical processing and tasks requiring GPU resources\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD FLAVOR FAMILY<|>EVENT<|>The standard flavor family in Pouta includes a range of virtual machine configurations suitable for general purposes\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HPC FLAVOR FAMILY<|>EVENT<|>The HPC (High Performance Computing) flavor family in Pouta is designed for high computational tasks, offering configurations with enhanced processing capabilities\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is the organization responsible for providing the Pouta cloud services, including the management of instances and volumes\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenStack is the underlying technology platform that Pouta uses to offer cloud services, including computing and storage capabilities\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAPSHOT<|>POUTA<|>Snapshots are a feature provided by Pouta for backing up or duplicating instances<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I/O FLAVORS<|>POUTA<|>I/O flavors are specific configurations available in Pouta for instances requiring high I/O operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPU FLAVORS<|>POUTA<|>GPU flavors are provided by Pouta for instances that need graphical processing capabilities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD FLAVOR FAMILY<|>POUTA<|>The standard flavor family is a range of VM configurations offered by Pouta for general purposes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HPC FLAVOR FAMILY<|>POUTA<|>The HPC flavor family is offered by Pouta for high performance computing tasks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>POUTA<|>CSC is responsible for the operation and management of Pouta cloud services<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>POUTA<|>Pouta uses OpenStack technology to provide its cloud services<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
