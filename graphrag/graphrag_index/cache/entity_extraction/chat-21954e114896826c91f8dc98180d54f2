Each task then \n      uses some other parallelization than MPI to do work. The most common strategy \n      is for every MPI task to launch multiple threads using OpenMP.\n    - Quite rare in bioscience applications\n\nTo find out what category your application belongs to, read the documentation.\n\nIt should also be noted that more cores does not automatically mean\nfaster run time. Reserving too many cores can actually make the\nsoftware run slower. The optimal number of cores depends on the\napplication, data and the analysis performed. You should check the\napplication documentation to see if the developers give any\nguidelines. It is also a good idea to run some tests with different\ncore numbers to see how well the application scales.\n\n\n### How much memory does my application need?\n\nEstimating the required memory can be quite difficult. In many cases\nit is affected by the data and the application options chosen. Also\nnumber of threads used can often effect the memory requirements.\n\nYou should read the application documentation to see if the developers\ngive any estimate. Often it is also helpful to check the user forums,\nif the software has one.\n\nOften, especially when running an application for the first time, you\njust have to make a guess. If you get an error message about memory\nrunning out, increase memory reservation and try again. If the job\nfinishes, you can check the actual memory usage and use that to make\nthe reservations in the future.\n\nMore information can be found in this FAQ entry: [How to estimate how\nmuch memory my batch job\nneeds?](../faq/how-much-memory-my-job-needs.md)\n\n\n### How much time should I reserve?\n\nKnowing the run tme in advance can also be difficult if you are not\nfamiliar with the application.\n\nYou should make sure to reserve enough, as the job will be stopped\nwhen the time reservation runs out, whether it is finished or not.\n\nOn the other hand reserving too much time is not that big of a\nproblem. The job will finish when the last task of the job\nfinishes. Your job will only consume billing units according to the\nactual elapsed time, not according to reservation.\n\nIt is OK to reserve the maximum time allowed in the partition you are\nusing when running an application first time. After the job finishes,\nyou can check the elapsed time, and make a more informed reservation\nnext time.\n\n\n## Running your job\n\n### Interactive jobs\n\nInteractive jobs are good for things like testing, running small tasks\nand for software that has a graphical user interface.\n\nAs mentioned, you should not run jobs in the login node. Instead you\ncan use **sinteractive** command to open an interactive shell:\n\n```text\nsinteractive -i\n```\nFor more detailed instructions, see the User Guide: [Interactive usage](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md)\n\nLonger jobs that take more resources are best run as batch jobs.\n\n### Batch jobs\n\nRunning a batch job typically has three steps:\n1. Make sure you have all the necessary input files\n    1. For instructions on how to move data from your own computer to Puhti, see section [Data/Moving data](../../data/moving/index.md) in the User Guide\n2. Write a batch job script\n    1. Use a text editor like nano, vim or emacs to write the script\n    2. If you write the script on your own computer, and move it to \n       Puhti, some care should be taken. Make sure it is saved as text, \n       not as a Word doc or something like that. Also be aware that Windows \n       treats line endings differently than Linux, and this can cause problems.\n3. Submit the job\n\nHere is an example batch job script. It is saved as *myjobscript*\n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=bowtie2\n#SBATCH --account=project_123456\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n#SBATCH --mem=16g\n#SBATCH --time=04:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nmodule load biokit\nbowtie2 -p $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -x genome -1 reads_1.fq -2 reads_2.fq > output.sam\n```\n\nAll the lines staring with **#SBATCH** are passed on to the batch job\nsystem. We use them to request the necessary resources.\n\nJob name (--job-name) is mainly used to identify your job *e.g.* when\nlisting jobs with **squeue** or checking past jobs with **sacct**.\n\nIt is necessary to to inform the system which project should be\nbilled. This is done with **--account**. You can check the projects that\nyou belong to in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/myProjects) or with `csc-projects`\nin the command line.\n\nBowtie2 is a shared memory application. As discussed earlier that\nmeans it can use more than one core, but all cores must be in the same\nnode. We specify that we want to run one task (--ntask=1) in one node\n(--nodes=1) using 16 cores (--cpus-per-task):\n\n```text\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n```\n\nBecause it is a shared memory application we can use `--mem` to specify\nthe total\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
