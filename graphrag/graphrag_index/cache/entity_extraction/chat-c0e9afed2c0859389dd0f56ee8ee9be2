You can get more information about the files and\ndirectories with command `ls -la`. The `-l` option produces a long\ndirectory listing that, in addition to the name, contains also information\nabout the access permissions, the size and the modification time of files and\ndirectories. The option `-a` defines that all files, including also\nhidden files that start with dot (`.`) character, are listed. Below\nis a sample output for `ls -la` command:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -la\ntotal 26914\ndrwx------+ 3  kkayttaj csc         10 Dec 22 09:12 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  20 root     root         0 Dec 22 09:12 ..\ndrwx------+ 42 kkayttaj csc        472 Dec 22 09:07 ..\n-rwxr-x---+ 1  kkayttaj csc       1648 Dec 22 09:01 .cshrc\n-rw-------+ 1  kkayttaj csc         93 Dec 22 09:01 .my.cnf\n-rw-------+ 1  kkayttaj csc         48 Dec 22 09:05 Test.txt\n-rw-------+ 1  kkayttaj csc     878849 Jan 19 2009  input.table\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 2  kkayttaj csc          2 Dec 22 09:11 project1\n-rw-------+ 1  kkayttaj csc   26432051 Dec 22 09:08 results.out\n-rw-------+ 1  kkayttaj csc         25 Mar 27 2009  sample.data\n-rw-------+ 1  kkayttaj csc         49 Mar 27 2009  test.txt\n```\n\nThe first output row `total 26914` tells that the total size of the\nfiles in the directory is 26914 kB. In the list, the first character\ntells if the item is a file (`-`) or a directory (`d`). The next nine\ncharacters display the *access permissions* of the files (see the\n`chmod` command for more details). The next columns show the number of\nlinks pointing to the item, owner, user group, size in bytes,\nmodification time and the name of the file or directory.\n\nBy default, files are presented in alphabetical order. You can order\nthe results by modification time with the option `-t` or by size with the\noption `-S` (note: uppercase S, not lowercase s). Two other\nfrequently used options are `-h` (human-readable) which prints out the\nsizes of large files in megabytes or gigabytes, and `-r` which means\nreverse sorting order. For example, the command\n\n```bash\nls -ltrh\n```\n\nis very handy when you want to check what files have recently been\nmodified or created. The `ls` and `pwd` commands do not modify files in\nany way, so you can use them always when you want to know where you are\nand what files your current directory contains.\n\nThe command `cd directory_name` moves you from the current\ndirectory to a directory you specified. For example, the user `kkayttaj`\ncould go to their local temporary directory using the command\n\n```bash\ncd /local_scratch/kkayttaj\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\ncd $TMPDIR\n```\n\nIn the latter command, the automatically defined *environment variable*\n`$TMPDIR` that contains the explicit directory path is used to define\nthe target directory.\n\nNew directories can be created with the command `mkdir directory_name`.\nFor example, the command:\n\n```bash\nmkdir project1 \n```\n\nCreates a new directory called `project1`. You can use the `ls` command to\ncheck that the directory was created. Now you can go to this directory\nwith the command\n\n```bash\ncd project1 \n```\n\nYou can come back from the `project1` directory using the command\n\n```bash\ncd .. \n```\n\nNote the space between `cd` and the dots in the command. One dot (`.`) and\ntwo dots (`..`) have a special meaning in Linux. One dot (`.`)\nmeans the *current directory*, and two dots (`..`) means the directory that\nis one level up in the directory tree, i.e., the directory where the current\ndirectory resides. Executing the `cd` command without any arguments will\nalways move you back to your home directory, regardless of where you are in\nthe directory tree. An empty directory can be removed with the command\n`rmdir directory_name`. For example:\n\n```bash\nrmdir project1\n```\n\n## Basic commands for files\n\nOn a fundamental level, a file in a Linux system is just a string of\nbytes, were a byte consists of eight bits. So-called text files\ncontain only bytes that can be interpreted as text characters using the\nASCII encoding rules. Thus, these files can be considered as consisting of\nlines of text. In so-called binary files, also non-ASCII bytes are used,\nand they cannot and are not intended to be convertible to readable text.\nTypical examples of binary files are compiled programs, images or compressed\nfiles. Normally, users work mostly with text files, and also in the examples of\nthis guide, we normally assume that the files contain some kind of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
