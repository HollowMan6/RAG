 Load libraries, adjust paths, set environment variables\n- CSC uses [*Lmod*](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment modules which are based on the *Lua* programming language\n\n# How to access pre-installed software on CSC supercomputers\n\n- You can check the available applications and their respective modules in the [application list](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)\n   - Each application page in Docs CSC contains information on basic usage\n- You can use `module spider` to search for an application\n  - On LUMI you need to first run `module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles` to see modules installed by CSC\n- Use the software by loading the module: `module load modulename`\n   - For example: `module load gromacs-env`\n\n# How to use modules\n\n- The general syntax is simple: `module command modulename`\n   - [List of the most common commands](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/modules/#module-commands-table)\n- These modules are used both in *interactive sessions* and *batch jobs*\n   - Include `module purge` and `module load modulename` in your batch scripts to always get the same modules in consecutive jobs\n- You can't just load all the modules because of possibly conflicting dependencies\n\n# Useful commands for the module environment\n\n- These commands will help you navigate the module environment:\n   - `module list`: See a list of the currently loaded modules\n   - `module avail`: Modules currently available for loading (hides modules that can't be loaded at the moment due to dependencies)\n   - `module spider modulename`: Search for an application in the list of all existing modules\n   - `module spider modulename/version`: Gives information on how to load a specific version of a module (prerequisites *etc.*)\n- If you try to load a module that is unavailable, you will get an error message\n\n# Various kinds of modules\n\n- Some modules contain software that have a graphical user interface\n   - For example, the chemistry visualization software [VMD](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/vmd/)\n   - Use the [Puhti](https://www.puhti.csc.fi) or [Mahti web interface](https://www.mahti.csc.fi), or [another method to open the GUI](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/#using-graphical-applications)\n- Some modules contain software that only provide a command-line interface\n   - For example, the [OpenBabel module](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/openbabel/)\n- A module might contain only one program (*e.g.* `gromacs-env`), while some provide a collection of applications (*e.g.* Python or R packages)\n   - For example, [Geoconda](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/geoconda/) and [Python Data](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python-data/)\n\n# Conda, Python and R packages\n\n- Some pre-installed software are distributed through the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package management tool\n   - Do not install Conda environments directly on the Lustre parallel file system, [containerize](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/singularity-scratch/) them instead using *e.g.* [Tykky](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/)\n   - See the [usage policy](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/#conda-installations) for further details\n- Pre-installed Python packages are available in [Python-related modules](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python/)\n   - Check Docs CSC for the available packages and usage instructions \n   - It is not possible to load multiple modules with Python packages at once\n   - `pip list` shows a [list of packages](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_list/) installed in the current environment\n- Instructions on [how to check installed R libraries](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/#r-package-installations)\n   - RStudio shows available packages in the sidebar\n  \n# Customizing your own environment\n\n- If you \"always\" use certain modules, it is possible to load them in your `.bashrc`, but **we do not recommend this**\n   - This causes the modules to be always loaded, also in batch jobs which may cause hard-to-spot issues\n   - If you already did this, see the [`csc-env`](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/) command\n-\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
