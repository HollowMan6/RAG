When these commands are\nused, the user must use option `-p` to define the number of processor\ncores to be used. For example, compressing the file `my_data.dat` using\nfour cores can be done with command:\n\n```bash\npbzip2 -p4 my_data.dat\n```\n\nSimilarly, to decompress the file with two cores you can use command:\n\n```bash\npunbzip2 -p2 my_data.dat.bz2\n```\n\nThe `pbzip2` and `pbunzip2` commands scale well for small core numbers.\nAlready with two cores the `pbzip2` is about as fast as `gzip`. The number\nof processors used does not affect to the actual output file. Thus, a\nfile that has been compressed with parallel `pbzip2` can be uncompressed\nwith normal `bunzip2` command and vice versa.\n\n### zip and unzip: the combined compression and file archiving tool\n\nThe **zip** program can be used for both archiving and compressing\nfiles. Given a list of files or directories, the `zip` command archives\nand compresses all the files into a single zip archive file. So, in\nprinciple, `zip` is analogous to the combination of `tar` and `gzip`\ncommands. Later, the whole archive, or just certain files, can be\nextracted from the archive. The basic syntax of `zip` command is:\n\n```bash\nzip -options archive_file source_name\n```\n\nThe `source_name` can be a list of files, directories, or a combination\nof both that will be packed in to the `archive_file`. If the\n`archive_file` already exists, `zip` will replace the existing files in the\narchive with new ones from the `source_name` list, or add files if they\ndo not exist in the `archive_file` yet. Note that unlike the `tar` command,\n`zip` does not add any files from subdirectories into the archive by\ndefault. The option `-r` is needed to recursively add all files and\nsubfolders from a given directory to the zip archive. Below is listed\nsome commonly used `zip` command options.\n\n| Option   | Function                                                                                                                             |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `-d`     | Remove (delete) entries from a zip archive                                                                                           |\n| `-e`     | Encrypt the contents of the zip archive using a password which is entered on the terminal in response to a prompt                    |\n| `-f`     | Replace (freshen) an existing file in the archive only if it has been modified more recently than the version already in the archive |\n| `-l`     | Translate the Unix end-of-line character LF into the MSDOS convention CR LF                                                          |\n| `-ll`    | Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF                                                                                   |\n| `-r`     | Travel the directory structure recursively                                                                                           |\n| `-u`     | Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files                                                                |\n| `-@`     | Take the list of input files from standard input.
