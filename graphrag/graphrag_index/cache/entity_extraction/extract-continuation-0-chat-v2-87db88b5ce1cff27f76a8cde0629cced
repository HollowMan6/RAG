Remember the username, password, database name and the database service name. Use the `-p` flag to modify default parameters\n\n```bash\noc new-app --template=mariadb-persistent\n```\n\n- Add WebSocat by launching the [OpenShift template](https://github.com/CSCfi/websocat-template/blob/main/websocat-template.yaml). You can check the target port with `oc describe services <service name>`. The default parameters for the service name and target port are `mariadb` and 3306, respectively\n\n```bash\noc new-app --file=/path/to/websocat-template.yaml\\\n  --param=DATABASE_SERVICE=<service name>.<project name>.svc\\\n  --param=DATABASE_PORT=<port>\n```\n\n- Remember the route hostname of the form `websocat-<project name>.2.rahtiapp.fi`. You can check this later with `oc get route websocat`\n\nIf you visit the Route URL with you browser, you should see this message:\n\n```\nOnly WebSocket connections are welcome here\n```\n\n## Step 2: Running WebSocat on CSC supercomputers\n\nMariaDB and WebSocat have now been set up on Rahti 2 and you should have the following details: MariaDB username, password, database name and the WebSocat route hostname. These are needed when connecting to the database. However, first we need to run the `websocat` binary on Puhti/Mahti to open the required TCP tunnel.\n\n- [Download `websocat` from GitHub](https://github.com/vi/websocat/releases) and add it to your `PATH`. For example:\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/vi/websocat/releases/download/v1.8.0/websocat_amd64-linux-static \\\n  -O websocat\nchmod +x websocat\nexport PATH=$PATH:$PWD\n```\n\n- We do not want to run WebSocat on the login node, so open an interactive session with `sinteractive -i` and launch `websocat`. By passing 0 as the target port, WebSocat gets handed an available port which we can extract using `lsof` (the below commands are conveniently put into a script). Recall that the `<project name>` placeholder in the route hostname provided to `websocat` refers to the name of your Rahti 2 project\n\n```bash\nwebsocat -b tcp-l:127.0.0.1:0 wss://websocat-<project name>.2.rahtiapp.fi -E &\nws_pid=$!  # $! contains the process ID of the most recently executed background command\nmkdir -p /tmp/$USER\nlsof -i -p $ws_pid 2>/dev/null | grep TCP | grep -oE \"localhost:[0-9]*\" | \\\n  cut -d \":\" -f2 > /tmp/$USER/${SLURM_JOB_ID}_rahtidb_port\necho \"Got target port $(cat /tmp/$USER/${SLURM_JOB_ID}_rahtidb_port)\"\n```\n\n!!! info\n\n    If you want to access your database within a batch job, run `websocat` within your batch script. You can utilize the same obtained target port if you're submitting your job from an interactive session in which `websocat` is already running, `websocat -b tcp-l:127.0.0.1:<port> wss://websocat-<project name>.2.rahtiapp.fi -E &`. Otherwise, pass 0 as the target port and check which one it gets handed using `lsof`.\n\n- Now `websocat` is running in the interactive session/batch job and you may connect to your MariaDB database on Rahti 2 using the obtained target port. You can verify the connection with e.g. Python. Note that the username and password below refer to the created database service, not your CSC credentials\n\n!!! info\n\n    For this example to work, you need to install the mariadb python module. At the time of writing this the command to use is:\n    `pip3 install mariadb=1.0.11`\n    This is due to the fact that the current last version of the module is broken for the platforms we tested this with. See the upstream documentation for more information: <https://mariadb-corporation.github.io/mariadb-connector-python/install.html>\n\n\n```python\n# Module Imports\nimport mariadb\nimport sys\n\n# Connect to MariaDB Platform\ntry:\n    conn = mariadb.connect(\n        user=\"<username>\",\n        password=\"<password>\",\n        host=\"127.0.0.1\",\n        port=<port>,\n        database=\"<database name>\"\n\n    )\nexcept mariadb.Error as e:\n    print(f\"Error connecting to MariaDB Platform: {e}\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Get Cursor\ncur = conn.cursor()\n```\n\n**Note:** The websocat client will only listen on IPv4. On some systems it is then necessary to use `127.0.0.1` as host, otherwise IPv6 will be used and it will not connect.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARIADB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MariaDB is a database management system that uses SQL for database access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBSOCAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WebSocat is a command-line tool that provides WebSocket client and server functionality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>GEO<|>Rahti 2 is a cloud service platform where MariaDB and WebSocat are set up for this project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is one of CSC's supercomputers where websocat binary is run to open a TCP tunnel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is another supercomputer by CSC, alongside Puhti, where websocat can be run)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIADB<|>RAHTI 2<|>MariaDB is set up on Rahti 2 as part of the project's database system<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEBSOCAT<|>RAHTI 2<|>WebSocat is deployed on Rahti 2 to facilitate WebSocket connections for the project<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEBSOCAT<|>PUHTI<|>WebSocat is run on Puhti to open a TCP tunnel for the project<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEBSOCAT<|>MAHTI<|>WebSocat can also be run on Mahti for the same purpose as on Puhti<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIADB<|>WEBSOCAT<|>WebSocat connects to MariaDB database on Rahti 2 for the project<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
