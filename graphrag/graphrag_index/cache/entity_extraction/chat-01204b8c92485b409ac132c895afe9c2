The main benefit of using a\ncontainer is that it provides an isolated software environment for each\napplication, which makes it easier to install and manage complex applications.\n\nThis page provides guidance on preparing your Singularity/Apptainer containers\nfor use with LUMI. Please consult the [container jobs page][container-jobs] for\nguidance on running your container on LUMI.\n\n!!! note\n    There are two major providers of the `singularity` runtime, namely\n    [Singularity CE][singularityce] and [Apptainer][apptainer], with the latter\n    being a fork of the former. For most cases, these should be fully compatible.\n    LUMI provides a Singularity CE runtime.\n\n## Pulling container images from a registry\n\nSingularity allows pulling existing container images (Singularity or Docker)\nfrom container registries such as [DockerHub][dockerhub] or [AMD Infinity\nHub][infinity-hub]. Pulling container images from registries can be done on\nLUMI. For instance, the Ubuntu image `ubuntu:22.04` can be pulled from\nDockerHub with the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ singularity pull docker://ubuntu:22.04\n```\n\nThis will create the Singularity image file `ubuntu_22.04.sif` in the directory\nwhere the command was run. Once the image has been pulled, the container can be\nrun. Instructions for running the container may be found on the [container jobs\npage][container-jobs].\n\n!!! warning \"Take care when pulling container images\"\n    Please take care to only use images uploaded from reputable sources as\n    these images can easily be a source of security vulnerabilities or even\n    contain malicious code.\n\n!!! hint \"Set cache directories when using Docker containers\"\n    When pulling or building from Docker containers using `singularity`, the\n    conversion can be quite heavy. Speed up the conversion and avoid leaving\n    behind temporary files by using the in-memory filesystem on `/tmp` as the\n    Singularity cache directory, i.e.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ mkdir -p /tmp/$USER\n    $ export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/tmp/$USER\n    $ export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/tmp/$USER\n    ```\n\n## Building Apptainer/Singularity SIF containers\n\nBuilding your own container on LUMI is, unfortunately, not in general possible.\nThe `singularity build` command, in general, requires some level of root\nprivileges, e.g. `sudo` or `fakeroot`, which are disabled on LUMI for security\nreasons. Thus, to build your own Singularity/Apptainer container for\nLUMI, you have two options:\n\n1. Use the [cotainr](#building-containers-using-the-cotainr-tool) tool to build\n   containers on LUMI (only for certain use cases).\n2. [Build your own container](#building-containers-on-local-hardware) on your\n   local hardware, e.g. your laptop.\n\n### Building containers using the cotainr tool\n\n[Cotainr][cotainr] is a tool that makes it easy to build Singularity/Apptainer\ncontainers on LUM\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
