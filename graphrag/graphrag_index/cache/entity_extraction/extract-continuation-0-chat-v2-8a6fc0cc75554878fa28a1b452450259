Also meanwhile you are allowed to edit Grub boot parameters, the root single mode access is disabled by default for security reasons. The procedure to perform a rescue is as follows:\n\n1. You need to have installed the [OpenStack command line tools](/cloud/pouta/install-client/). And you have to login, and see [Configure your terminal environment for OpenStack](/cloud/pouta/install-client/#configure-your-terminal-environment-for-openstack) for reference.\n\n1. Get the server's ID, and store it in an environment variable called: `INSTANCE_UUID`:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ openstack server list\n\t+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------+----------------------------+-------+----------------+\n\t| ID                                   | Name      | Status | Networks                   | Image | Flavor         |\n\t+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------+----------------------------+-------+----------------+\n\t| 55555566-ffff-4a52-5735-356251902325 | comp1     | ACTIVE | net=192.168.211.211        |       | standard.small |\n\t+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------+----------------------------+-------+----------------+\n\n\t```\n\n1. Get the image ID. You can store the ID into an environment variable `IMAGE_UUID`. You should use the same image as your instance: (The ID may vary from the example below)\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ openstack image list\n\t+--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+\n    | ID                                   | Name                 | Status |\n\t+--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+\n\t| 56b70226-0c52-48c6-973f-3f726b5e7dc0 | CentOS-7             | active |\n\t| 2d20266d-43f7-499e-b6e6-090b09416b16 | CentOS-7-Cuda        | active |\n\t| c80adfec-05a8-4c42-8922-4bccdf90df40 | CentOS-8-Stream      | active |\n\t| 2ca237c5-bd0a-4469-ae9f-20878dd288a9 | Fedora Cloud Base 31 | active |\n\t| ee19819d-17d5-4f71-ac38-e024d046eb6a | Ubuntu-18.04         | active |\n\t| 668d235f-e6e4-421d-964c-0016f9560206 | Ubuntu-20.04         | active |\n\t| aea0bf58-85fb-4f9c-b2ea-ffa6c7a07c02 | Ubuntu-22.04         | active |\n\t| 3a9aad67-0f9c-4493-b574-17fe28d40afc | cirros               | active |\n\t+--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+\n\t```\n\n1. Shutdown the instance:\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack server stop $INSTANCE_UUID\n\t```\n\n1. Check that the VM is stopped:\n\t\n\t```sh\n\topenstack server list\n\t```\n\n\tThe Status should be `SHUTOFF`\n\n1. You are now ready to launch the rescue of the instance:\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack server rescue --image $IMAGE_UUID $INSTANCE_UUID\n\t```\n\n1. Make sure that the instance is in rescue mode with:\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack server list\n\t```\n\n\tThe Status should be `RESCUE`\n\n## Connecting\n\n### Using ssh \n\nThe rescue image will get the same SSH keys as configured in the VM you are rescuing,\nso you should be able to ssh into the instance, using the same user and IP as the normal ones.\n\n```sh\nssh <default-user>@<floating-ip>\n```\n\nYou will get this warning: `WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!`. This is what is called the `host keys`, they are stored in the VM's disk, and they change because you are booting using a different disk. Fix it by removing the line of your instance IP address from the file `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. An alternative way is the execution of the following command:\n\n```sh\nssh-keygen -f \"~/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R \"$INSTANCE_IP\"\n```\n\n### Using Pouta's web console (with Cirros)\n\nIn some cases, like when you lose the private SSH key, you will need to use Pouta's web console. For this to work, you need to select the **Cirros** image in the step 3 above.\n\nLogin in Pouta's web interface: <https://pouta.csc.fi>. Look for your instance and click in `console`.\n\n![Web console](/img/pouta-web-console.png)\n\nThe username and password should be printed in the console text, above the login.\n\n!!! Warning \"Cirros\"\n    The Cirros image is a small Linux distribution image with limited software support and security updates. It should be used only for rescue operations when normal SSH access is not possible.\n\n## Mount the disk \n\n1. Check what volumes you have. If you don't have any other volumes attached it should look something like this:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ lsblk\n\tNAME   MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\n\tvda    253:0    0  10\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK COMMAND LINE TOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of tools for interacting with the OpenStack cloud software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS-7<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Linux distribution that is a community-supported enterprise software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU-20.04<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Linux distribution based on Debian, focused on user-friendliness and stability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIRROS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A small Linux distribution designed for use as a test image on clouds such as OpenStack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUTA'S WEB CONSOLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A web interface provided by CSC for accessing and managing cloud instances)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK COMMAND LINE TOOLS<|>CENTOS-7<|>OpenStack command line tools can be used to manage instances running on CentOS-7<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK COMMAND LINE TOOLS<|>UBUNTU-20.04<|>OpenStack command line tools can be used to manage instances running on Ubuntu-20.04<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK COMMAND LINE TOOLS<|>CIRROS<|>OpenStack command line tools can be used to manage instances running on Cirros<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUTA'S WEB CONSOLE<|>CIRROS<|>Pouta's web console can be used for accessing instances running on Cirros, especially in rescue operations<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
