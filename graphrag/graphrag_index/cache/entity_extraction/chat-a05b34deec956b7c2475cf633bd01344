In this example, we use this feature to run 16\n    MPI tasks on a LUMI-C compute nodes. In a way that spreads out the MPI ranks\n    across all compute core complexes (CCDs, L3 cache). Typically, this is done\n    to get more effective memory capacity and memory bandwidth per MPI rank and\n    increase cache capacity available to each rank.\n\n    ```bash\n    #SBATCH ...\n    #SBATCH --partition=standard\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16\n    \n    # First socket\n    export SLURM_CPU_BIND=\"map_cpu:0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56\"\n    # Second socket\n    export SLURM_CPU_BIND=\"${SLURM_CPU_BIND},64,72,80,88,96,104,112,120\"\n    \n    # Alternative way using the seq command\n    #export SLURM_CPU_BIND=\"map_cpu:$(seq -s ',' 0 8 127)\"\n\n    srun <app> <args>\n    ```\n\n    The example above, we use the `SLURM_CPU_BIND` environment variable to set\n    the CPU map. This is equivalent to using `--cpu-bind` option with `srun`.\n\n    For hybrid MPI+OpenMP application multiple core need to be assigned to each\n    of the tasks. These can be achieved by setting a CPU mask, \n    `--cpu-bind=cpu_mask:<task1_mask,task2_mask,...>`, where the task masks are\n    hexadecimal values. For example, with 16 tasks per node and 4 cores\n    (threads) per task, one every 2 cores assigned to the task. In this \n    scenario, the base mask will be `0x55` in hexadecimal which is `0b01010101`\n    in binary. Then, to binding masks for the tasks will be\n\n    - First task `0x55`: cores 0, 2, 4 and 6\n    - Second task `0x5500`: cores 8, 10, 12 and 14\n    - Third task `0x550000`: cores 16 18 20 and 22\n    - ...\n\n    So that, the CPU mask will be `0x55,0x5500,0x550000,...`. Setting the CPU\n    mask can be tedious, below is an example script that computes and set the\n    CPU mask based on the values of `SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE` and \n    `OMP_NUM_THREADS`.\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16\n    #SBATCH --partition=standard\n    #SBATCH --time=12:00:00\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    \n    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\n    export OMP_PROC_BIND=true\n    export OMP_PLACES=cores\n    \n    cpus_per_task=$((SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE / SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE))\n    threads_spacing=$((cpus_per_task / OMP_NUM_THREADS))\n    \n    base_mask=0x0\n    for i in $(seq 0 ${threads_spacing} $((cpus_per_task-1)))\n    do\n      base_mask=$((base_mask | (0x1 << i)))\n    done\n\n    declare -a cpu_masks=()\n    for i in $(seq 0 ${cpus_per_task} 127)\n    do\n      mask_format=\"%x%$((16 * (i/64)))s\"\n      task_mask=$(printf ${mask_format} $((base_mask << i)) | tr \" \" \"0\")\n      cpu_masks=(${cpu_masks[@]} ${task_mask})\n    done\n\n    export SLURM_CPU_BIND=$(IFS=, ; echo \"mask_cpu:${cpu_masks[*]}\")\n\n    srun <app> <args>\n    ```\n\nMore options and details are available in the [srun documentation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
