With the help of the `module`\ncommand, you will be able to load and unload the desired compilers, tools and\nlibraries.\n\nSoftware modules allow you to control which software and versions are available\nin your environment. Modules contain the necessary information to allow you to\nrun a particular application or provide you access to a particular library so\nthat\n\n- different versions of a software package can be provided.\n- you can easily switch to different versions without having to explicitly\n  specify different paths.\n- you don't have to deal with dependent modules, they are loaded at the same\n  time as the software.\n\nAlmost all compute clusters use software modules. Currently, there are three\ncompeting implementations, so you may not be familiar with Lmod yet. And\neven if you are already familiar with Lmod in your home cluster, we still\nencourage you to read through this page as not all sites promote the same Lmod\nfeatures.\n\n??? Info \"Which module system am I using?\"\n    There are currently three different popular implementations of modules:\n\n     - Environment Modules version 3.X which uses modules written in Tcl but itself\n       is written in C. This version is no longer maintained, but is one of the\n       systems offered on Cray systems.\n     - [Environment Modules version 4.X and 5.X](http://modules.sourceforge.net/)\n       which is a continuation of the Tcl modules but now entirely written\n       in Tcl itself. It is developed at CEA in France.\n     - [Lmod][lmod] uses module files written in Lua and itself is also written\n       in Lua. It is compatible with many Tcl module files (from both versions\n       of Environment Modules) through an automatic translation layer. Lmod is\n       developed at TACC.\n\n    You can see which version of modules your home cluster is using by executing\n    ```bash\n    module --version\n    ```\n    at the command prompt. For the old environment modules,\n    the output will start with `VERSION=3.2.11` or something similar, for the\n    new Environment Modules it will report as `Modules Release 4.X` or\n    `Modules Release 5.x` or something similar, and for Lmod it will explicitly\n    say `Modules based on Lua`.\n\n## The `module` command\n\nModules are managed by the `module` command:\n\n```bash\n$ module <sub-command> <module-name>\n```\n\nwhere the _sub-command_ indicates the operation you want to perform. The\n_sub-command_ is followed by the name of the module on which you want to perform\nthe operation.\n\n| Sub-command      | Description                                          |\n| -----------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| `spider`         | Search for modules and display help                  |\n| `keyword`, `key` | Search for modules based on keywords                 |\n| `avail`, `av`    | List available modules                               |\n| `whatis`         | Display short information about modules              |\n| `help`           | Print the help message of a module                   |\n| `list`           | List the currently modules loaded                    |\n| `load`, `add`    | Load a module                                        |\n| `unload`         | Remove a module from your environment                |\n| `purge`          | Unload all modules from your environment             |\n| `show`           | Show the commands in the module's definition file    |\n\n## Finding modules\n\nLmod is a hierarchical module system. It distinguishes between installed modules\nand available modules. Installed modules are all modules that are installed on\nthe system. Available modules are all modules that can be loaded directly at\nthat time without first loading other modules. The available modules are often\nonly a subset of the installed modules. However, Lmod can tell you for each\ninstalled module what steps you must take to also make it available so that\nyou can load it. Therefore, the commands for finding modules are so important.\n\nSome modules may also provide multiple software packages or extensions. Lmod can\nalso search for these.\n\n\n### module spider\n\nThe basic command to search for software on LUMI is `module spider`.\nIt has three levels, producing different outputs:\n\n 1. `module spider` without further arguments will produce a list of all\n    installed software and show some basic information about those packages.\n    Some packages may have an `(E)` behind their name and will appear in blue\n    (in the default color scheme) which means that they are part of a different\n    package. The following levels of `module spider` will then tell you how to\n    find which module(s) to load.\n\n    Note that `module spider` will also search in packages that are hidden from\n    being displayed. These packages can be loaded and used. However, we hide them\n    either because they are not useful to regular users or because we think that\n    they will rarely or never be directly loaded by a user and want\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a computing environment where software can be accessed through modules using the `module` command to load and unload compilers, tools, and libraries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LMOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lmod is a module system that uses module files written in Lua for managing software modules, including loading and unloading of software versions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENT MODULES VERSION 3.X<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An older module system implementation using modules written in Tcl and written in C, no longer maintained but offered on Cray systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENT MODULES VERSION 4.X AND 5.X<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A continuation of the Tcl modules system, now entirely written in Tcl, developed at CEA in France)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TACC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Texas Advanced Computing Center, where Lmod is developed)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LMOD<|>TACC<|>Lmod is developed at TACC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LMOD<|>ENVIRONMENT MODULES VERSION 3.X<|>Lmod is compatible with many Tcl module files from Environment Modules Version 3.X through an automatic translation layer<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LMOD<|>ENVIRONMENT MODULES VERSION 4.X AND 5.X<|>Lmod is compatible with many Tcl module files from Environment Modules Version 4.X and 5.X through an automatic translation layer<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
