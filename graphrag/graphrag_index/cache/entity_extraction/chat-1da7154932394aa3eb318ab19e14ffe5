Next, we encrypt a file with public keys of two different collaborators (research group A and research group B).\n\n**Python 3.6+ is required** to use the Crypt4GH encryption utility. If you need help installing Python, please follow [these instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).\n\n1. Install the Crypt4GH encryption CLI tool\n\n      You can install Crypt4GH directly with pip tool:\n\n      ```bash\n      pip install crypt4gh     \n      ```\n\n      or, if you prefer the latest sources from GitHub:\n\n      ```bash\n      pip install -r crypt4gh/requirements.txt\n      pip install ./crypt4gh\n      ```\n\n      or even:\n\n      ```bash\n      pip install git+https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh.git\n      ```\n\n      The usual `-h` flag shows you the different options that the tool accepts:\n\n      ```bash\n      $ crypt4gh -h\n\n      Utility for the cryptographic GA4GH standard, reading from stdin and outputting to stdout.\n\n      Usage:\n         {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] encrypt [--sk <path>] --recipient_pk <path> [--recipient_pk <path>]... [--range <start-end>]\n         {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] decrypt [--sk <path>] [--sender_pk <path>] [--range <start-end>]\n         {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] rearrange [--sk <path>] --range <start-end>\n         {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] reencrypt [--sk <path>] --recipient_pk <path> [--recipient_pk <path>]... [--trim]\n\n      Options:\n         -h, --help             Prints this help and exit\n         -v, --version          Prints the version and exits\n         --log <file>           Path to the logger file (in YML format)\n         --sk <keyfile>         Curve25519-based Private key.\n                              When encrypting, if neither the private key nor C4GH_SECRET_KEY are specified, we generate a new key\n         --recipient_pk <path>  Recipient's Curve25519-based Public key\n         --sender_pk <path>     Peer's Curve25519-based Public key to verify provenance (akin to signature)\n         --range <start-end>    Byte-range either as  <start-end> or just <start> (Start included, End excluded)\n         -t, --trim             Keep only header packets that you can decrypt\n\n      Environment variables:\n         C4GH_LOG         If defined, it will be used as the default logger\n         C4GH_SECRET_KEY  If defined, it will be used as the default secret key (ie --sk ${C4GH_SECRET_KEY})\n      ```\n\n      You may notice that crypt4gh uses `--sk` option for the private key. This might seem odd but apparently, crypt4gh uses term _secure key_ for private key, hence `sk`, and consequently `pk` refers to public key instead of the private key.\n\n2. Generate your public-private key pair\n\n      You use `crypt4gh-keygen` command to create your private and public keys:\n\n      ```bash\n      $ crypt4gh-keygen --sk mykey.sec --pk mykey.pub\n      Generating public/private Crypt4GH key pair.\n      Enter passphrase for meykey.sec (empty for no passphrase): \n      Enter passphrase for mykey.sec (again): \n      Your private key has been saved in mykey.sec\n      Your public key has been saved in mykey.pub\n      ```\n\n      where `--sk mykey.sec` is your private (secret, sk) key and `--pk mykey.pub` is your public key (pk). The tool will ask you to enter a password (passphrase) for your private key. For security reasons, the password is not shown when you type it, so the tool will ask you to enter it a second time to make sure you made no typing errors (or, you make the same errors twice). Please, use a strong password!\n\n    !!! Note\n        If you lose or forget your private key, or the password to it, you will be unable to decrypt the files. Do not share your private key or your password.\n\n    !!! Note\n        You need to create your keys only once and use them for all your encryption needs, but you can of course, choose to generate separate keys for encryption as you wish.\n\n3. Encrypt a file\n\n      To encrypt files you will need the public keys of the recipients of the data. In this example we are sharing the data with two recipients: yourself and research group A. Your own public key (`mykey.pub`) was created in the previous step, and the public key of research group A (`groupA.pub`) we have received somehow (e.g. via email). To encrypt a file you use `crypt4gh encrypt` command:\n\n      ```bash\n      $ crypt4gh encrypt --recipient_pk mykey.pub --recipient_pk groupA.pub <dog.jpg >dog.jpg.c4gh\n      ```\n\n      The `crypt4gh` command uses\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
