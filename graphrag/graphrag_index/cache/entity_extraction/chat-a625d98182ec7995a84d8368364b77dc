Clean the Puhti scratch\n\nIf you do not need to continue working with the data on Puhti after uploading\nit to IDA, remove it from the scratch disk area of Puhti to free up disk space.\n\n## Copying data from IDA to Allas via Puhti\n\nIn order to copy data from IDA to Allas with this procedure, you need to be a\nmember of a project that has Allas and Puhti services in use. On the IDA side,\nyou either need to be a member of a project which has IDA service in use, or\nthe data in question needs to be publicly available for downloading. Note that\nthe projects in Allas, Puhti and IDA do not need to be the same.\n\nIn short, there are four steps to follow:\n\n1. Download the data from IDA to Puhti scratch disk\n2. Rearrange the data on the scratch disk, if necessary\n3. Upload the data to Allas\n4. Clean the Puhti scratch disk\n\n### Step 1. Download the data from IDA to Puhti scratch\n\nScratch disk area in Puhti is recommended as it is by default much larger than\nother areas, e.g. user's home folder. Also, you can request even larger scratch\nquota if the default is not enough. For more details about Puhti disk areas,\nsee [Supercomputer disk areas](../../computing/disk.md).\n\nFor example, create a new directory `xferdir` for the data under the scratch\narea of `project_2000012` (replace this with your own project ID):\n\n```bash\nmkdir /scratch/project_2000012/xferdir\n```\n\nIf the data to be downloaded from IDA is in a project the user belongs to, then\ndownloading the data from IDA can be done with the IDA command-line tool:\n\n```bash\nida download <target_in_ida> <local_file>\n```\n\nContinuing our example, if the data in IDA is in a directory `testi` of project\n2000001, the download commands to run on Puhti are:\n\n```bash\nmodule load ida\ncd /scratch/project_2000012/xferdir\nida download -p 2000001 testi testi.zip\n```\n\nThe last argument of the `ida download` command is the file name given to the\ndata on Puhti. As in this case a directory is downloaded, it will be downloaded\nas a zip package. If the user has used and configured the IDA command-line\ntool previously, then the download command uses that configuration. If not,\nthen the upload command asks the user for their username and password in IDA.\n[See detailed instructions here](../ida/using_ida.md#configuring-and-using-ida-in-csc-supercomputers).\n\nIf the data to be downloaded from IDA is a published open dataset visible in\nFairdata Etsin, then downloading it requires two steps; locating and copying\nthe download command in Etsin, and then downloading the dataset. The download\nbutton in Etsin has an option to show download commands for a few command-line\ntools.\n\nAgain continuing our example, the user selects a dataset directory for\ndownloading in Etsin. After a while, the zip package is ready, and Etsin shows\nthe download button:\n\n![Etsin download](img/etsin-download.png)\n\nUser clicks the option menu of the download button to see the command-line\noptions:\n\n![Etsin download options](img/etsin-download-options.png)\n\nThe user could then, for example, copy the `curl` command and run it on Puhti:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2000012/xferdir\ncurl -fOJ \"https://ida191.csc.fi:4430/download?token=18f6e5b7edae4f12a8a654ea22d57aa9.PA0p5PMqnzvgcXAU0Lw9SuVcyoQGgV8Ugnk3GEppU0b4UUhGWRLP8FRHB2MvyUTjPA0p5PMqnzvgcXAU0Lw9SuVcyoQGgV8Ugnk3GEppU0b4UUhGWRLP8FRHB2MvyUTjPA0p5PMqnzvgcXAU0Lw9SuVcyoQGgV8Ugnk3G_e3668097e34d437484e15d53624e7905=76679a7a-367c-474f-9e8c-c3869a106e2f_ehr3hd76&package=76679a7a-367c-474f-9e8c-c3869a106e2f_ehr3hd76.zip\"\n```\n\n### Step 2. Rearrange the data on scratch, if necessary\n\nIn case you would like to rearrange the data or remove parts of it, you can do\nit on the scratch disk before you upload it to Allas.\n\nContinuing our example, once the data is downloaded as `testi.zip` (or\n`76679a7a-367c-474f-9e8c-c3869a106e2f_ehr3hd76.zip` in case of an open dataset)\nin the project's scratch area, the package can simply be extracted with unzip:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2000012/xferdir\nunzip testi.zip\n```\n\n### Step 3. Upload the data to Allas\n\nThe easiest way to upload the data to Allas is using\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
