A task\ncorresponds to a process (or an MPI rank). One CPU thread (used, for example,\nwith OpenMP) is requested for the one task as well as 2 GiB of memory should be\nallocated to the whole job.\n\nThe next line defines the [Slurm partition][partitions] to which the job will\nbe submitted. Slurm partitions are (possibly overlapping) groups of nodes with\nsimilar resources or associated limits. In our example, the job doesn't use a\nlot of resources and will fit perfectly onto the `small` partition.\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n```\n\nNow that the needed resources for the job have been defined, the next step is\nto set up the environment. For example, copy input data from your home\ndirectory to the scratch file system or export environment variables.\n\n```bash\nmodule load MyApp/1.2.3\n```\n\nIn our example, we load a module so that the `MyApp` application is available\nto the batch job. Finally, with everything set up, we can launch our program\nusing the `srun` command.\n\n```bash\nsrun myapp -i input -o output\n```\n\nMore details may be found on the dedicated [batch jobs][batch-jobs] page.\n\n### Submit a batch job\n\nTo submit the job script we just created, we use the `sbatch` command.\nThe general syntax can be condensed as\n\n```bash\n$ sbatch [options] job_script [job_script_arguments ...]\n```\n\nThe available options are the same as the one you use in the batch script:\n`sbatch --nodes=2` in the command line and `#SBATCH --nodes=2` in a batch\nscript are equivalent. The command line value takes precedence if the same\noption is present both on the command line and as a directive in a script.\n\nFor the moment, let's limit ourselves to the most common way to use the\n`sbatch`: passing the name of the batch script which contains the submission\noptions.\n\n```bash\n$ sbatch myjob.sh\nSubmitted batch job 123456\n```\n\nThe `sbatch` command returns immediately. If the job is successfully\nsubmitted, the command prints out the ID number of the job.\n\nMore details may be found on the dedicated [batch jobs][batch-jobs] page.\n\n### Examine the queue\n\nOnce you have submitted your batch script, it won't necessarily run immediately.\nIt may wait in the queue of pending jobs for some time before its required\nresources become available. To view your jobs in the queue, use the `squeue` command.\n\n```bash\n$ squeue\n  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER  ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n 123456     small exampleJ lumi_usr  PD       0:00      1 (Priority)\n```\n\nThe output shows the state of your job in the `ST` column. In our case, the job\nis pending (`PD`). The last column indicates the reason why the job isn't\nrunning: `Priority`. This indicates that your job is queued behind a higher\npriority job. One other possible reason can be that your job is waiting for\nresources to become available. In such a case, the value in the `REASON` column\nwill be `Resources`.\n\nLet's look at the information that will be shown if your job is running:\n\n```bash\n$ squeue\n  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER  ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n 123456     small exampleJ lumi_usr   R      35:00      1 node-0123\n```\n\nThe `ST` column will now display a `R` value (for `RUNNING`). The `TIME` column\nwill represent the time your job has been running. The list of nodes on which\nyour job is executing is given in the last column of the output.\n\nIn practice, the list of jobs printed by this command will be much longer since\nall jobs, including those belonging to other users, will be visible. To see only\nthe jobs that belong to you, use the `squeue` command with the `--me` flag.\n\n```bash\n$ squeue --me\n```\n\nThe `squeue` command can also be used to determine when your pending job will\nstart.\n\n```bash\n$ squeue --me --start\n JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST          START_TIME  NODES SCHEDNODES           NODELIST(REASON)\n123456     batch Computat   vananh PD 2021-06-01T16:10:28      1 node0012             (Priority)\n123457     batch Computat   vananh PD 2021-06-01T18:21:28      1 (null)               (Priority)\n```\n\nIn our example, both jobs listed will start June 1 at different times. You will\nalso notice that for the first job, the scheduler plan to run the job on\n`node0012` while for the second job, no node has been chosen yet.\n\n### Cancelling a job\n\nSometimes things just don't go as planned. If your job doesn't run as expected,\nyou may need to cancel your job. This can be achieved using the `scancel`\ncommand which takes the job ID of the job to cancel.\n\n```bash\n$ scancel <jobid>\n```\n\nThe job ID can be obtained from the output of the `sbatch` command when\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM PARTITION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm partitions are groups of nodes with similar resources or associated limits, used to manage job submissions in a computing environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYAPP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MyApp is an application that can be loaded and executed in a batch job environment, indicating software or a tool used in computational tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBATCH<|>EVENT<|>SBATCH is a command used to submit a job script in a batch processing system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUEUE<|>EVENT<|>SQUEUE is a command used to view jobs in the queue of a batch processing system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCANCEL<|>EVENT<|>SCANCEL is a command used to cancel a submitted job in a batch processing system)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SBATCH<|>SLURM PARTITION<|>SBATCH command submits jobs to Slurm partitions based on the job's resource requirements<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SQUEUE<|>SBATCH<|>SQUEUE command is used after SBATCH to view the status of submitted jobs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCANCEL<|>SBATCH<|>SCANCEL command is used to cancel jobs that were submitted using SBATCH<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYAPP<|>SBATCH<|>MyApp is an example of an application that can be executed using the SBATCH command<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
