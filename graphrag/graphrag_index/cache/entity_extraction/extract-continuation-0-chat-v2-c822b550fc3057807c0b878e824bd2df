In this case, select the\n    _Accelerated Visualization_ app instead of _Desktop_ in the Puhti web\n    interface. On LUMI, select the regular _Desktop_ app and `lumid`\n    partition ([mode information](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/desktop/)).\n\n## License\n\nVisIt is free also for commercial use and has been released under\n[BSD Open Source License](https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/blob/develop/LICENSE)\n\n## Available\n\nPuhti: 3.1.3, 3.3.3\nMahti: 3.1.3, 3.3.1\nLUMI: 3.2.2\n\n## Parallel use\n\nVisIt can be run interactively in parallel configuration using several\nprocessors. Login to Puhti and submit the following to launch VisIt on a\ncompute node\n\n```bash\nmodule load visit/3.1.3\nvisit -l srun -np 2 -p test -t 00:10:00 -la --mem-per-cpu=2G -la --account=<your project>\n```\n\nThe job reservation parameters are:\n\n* `-np <number of cores>`\n* `-p <queue>`\n* `-t <time>` (hours:minutes:seconds)\n* `-la --mem-per-cpu=<memory per processor>` (in GB)\n* `-la --account=<the billing project for the job>`\n  \nNote that running VisIt with many processors does not necessarily bring speed\nbenefits. It will depend on VisIt's particular data reader if (and to what\nextent) the data can be distributed between the processors.\n\n## Using host profile of local VisIt installation\n\nThe VisIt client can be run on your local desktop computer while having VisIt\ncomponents that process the data remotely on Puhti. Local VisIt host profiles\ncan be used to launch jobs on Puhti compute nodes. Local and remote VisIt\nversions have to match.\n\nAn example of a working host profile is screen captured below.
