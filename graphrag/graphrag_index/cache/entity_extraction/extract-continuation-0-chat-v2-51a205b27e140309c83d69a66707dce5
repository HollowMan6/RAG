This can either be all the CPU\nnodes, all GPU nodes or even a combination of CPU and GPU nodes if needed. For\nthese runs, we can make changes to queue policies as needed. The slot we provide\nis at most 6 hours, but can be shorter if you either do not need the full 6h or\nthere are a lot of other users that have requested time for the same day.\n\nProvide at most a 1-page description of what you are intending to do with the\nfull-machine access (see template below). Do not request access before you have\nthe code and cases well-prepared, as the time slot is fixed and cannot be moved.\n\nThe deadline for the application is the Wednesday 11 days before the last Sunday every\nmonth, and acceptance notifications will be sent out on the Monday of the run week.\nResource usage for any runs during this window will be billed as\nusual, so make sure you have enough resources to complete any runs planned. The\napplications are submitted via the [LUMI helpdesk](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/)\nthrough the general contact form, as the \"large-scale runs\" category.\n\n## How to structure your proposal\n\n- **Project information:** project number and who will be performing the runs.\n  Provide direct contact details to everyone involved.\n- **Describe use case:** code(s) that will be used, what are you trying to\n  achieve.\n- **Requested resources:** describe the resources needed in enough detail so\n  that we can make any changes needed to the queue system etc. what nodes, how\n  many nodes, how many jobs running/queuing at the same time, size and length of\n  jobs, any other special considerations.\n- **Your preparations:** Describe what preparations you have done for the runs.\n  The idea here is to convince us that you are actually ready to utilize the\n  time slot. For scaling runs we require at least one run with the code at the\n  partition limits, so the largest run you can get through in normal production\n  use. For workflows, we require at least a description of how they will fill the\n  requested resources and how they will efficiently use them and achieve\n  something that cannot be done in the normal production queues. As well as\n  evidence that you already have it running on LUMI.\n\n## Post runs\n\nWe also require that you provide a short and simple summary of the runs you did\nafter you completed them, along with any issues you encountered.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI provides opportunities for large-scale runs on its supercomputer, offering access to CPU and GPU nodes for research and projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULY<|>EVENT<|>One of the months during which no full machine runs are scheduled at LUMI due to holiday seasons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUGUST<|>EVENT<|>One of the months during which no full machine runs are scheduled at LUMI due to holiday seasons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECEMBER<|>EVENT<|>One of the months during which no full machine runs are scheduled at LUMI due to holiday seasons)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULY<|>LUMI<|>No full machine runs are scheduled in July at LUMI due to reduced personnel<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUGUST<|>LUMI<|>No full machine runs are scheduled in August at LUMI due to reduced personnel<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECEMBER<|>LUMI<|>No full machine runs are scheduled in December at LUMI due to reduced personnel<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
