In addition, CSC organizes a [wide variety of training courses](https://www.csc.fi/en/trainings), many of which are related to data analytics and machine learning in CSC's computing environments.  Finally, CSC's specialists are happy to help with all aspects of your data driven research, and can be contacted via the [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, you need to:\n\n- have a [CSC account](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md)\n- be member of a CSC project, either by [creating a new project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md) or joining an existing project, e.g. by asking the [project manager to add you](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md)\n\nFinally, the project needs to have [access to the services](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) you will use.  More on our services below, and when you might use them.\n\n## CSC's services\n\nBelow is a short glossary of CSC's services that are most relevant for data analysis.\n\n[**Puhti**](../../computing/index.md) is CSC's supercomputer where most computing should be done.  [Puhti has a large set of pre-installed applications](../../apps/index.md), and scales up to very computing heavy tasks, including GPU-based processing.\n\n[**Allas**](../../data/Allas/index.md) is CSC's data storage service.  If you have big datasets or need to share data with people outside of your project, you should consider using Allas.\n\n[**Pouta**](../../cloud/pouta/index.md) is CSC's cloud service where you can create your own virtual server.  This gives you more control over the computing environment, but may not be suitable for very heavy computing tasks.  Pouta is also more suitable for processing sensitive data, especially the ePouta variant.\n\n[**Rahti**](../../cloud/rahti/index.md) is CSC's container cloud.  Here you can easily create virtual applications based on container images.\n\n[**Noppe**](https://noppe.csc.fi/) is a great service if you just want to run a quick analysis directly in your web browser. Noppe supports Jupyter with Python tools for data analysis and machine learning, and also RStudio.\n\n## Example use cases\n\n### Getting into data-driven research\n\n*You have been dabbling in Excel or SPSS but now you are looking for more powerful ways to handle your data.*\n\nA great way to start with data analytics is to attend a course. You can check out upcoming courses on the [CSC training website](https://www.csc.fi/en/trainings). Also, CSC has some training materials that are suitable for self-learning, such as these introductory courses:\n\n- [R for Beginners](https://github.com/csc-training/R-for-beginners)\n- [Data Analysis with R](https://github.com/csc-training/da-with-r-remote)\n- [Practical Machine Learning (using Python)](https://e-learn.csc.fi/course/view.php?id=14)\n\nIf you are in the field of bioinformatics, you might also want to check out the [Chipster platform](https://chipster.csc.fi/).\n\nThere is also plenty of data science information available online, some popular resources include [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/data-science/),\n[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/data-science).\n\nIf you don't want to set up a development environment on your own laptop, you can easily use [Rahti](../../cloud/rahti/access.md) to set up an RStudio environment using a ready-made RStudio template from the template catalog.\nMore info about the RStudio template can be found in the [RStudio-openshift GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSCfi/rstudio-openshift).  \nWe also have [instructions on how to use the Allas object storage from RStudio](https://github.com/CSCfi/rstudio-openshift/blob/master/Allas.md).\n\n### Scaling up from your laptop (beginner)\n\n*You have been running analyses in R or Python for some time already, but you have reached the limits of your own laptop or desktop computer. Perhaps you need more memory or faster processing?*\n\nIn most cases, the next step would be to move to CSC's supercomputer Puhti, which is a high performance computing (HPC) cluster. That means it's not one computer, but a collection of many computers. Users access the front-end server (login node) of Puhti, where they can submit computing jobs to a queuing system which takes care of distributing them to the cluster's different computers (compute nodes).  Please read the [instructions on how to access Puhti](../../computing/index.md), and [how to submit computing jobs to Puhti's queuing system](../../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\nPuhti has a [large selection of scientific computing applications pre-installed](../../apps/index.md), including [R and RStudio Server](../../apps/r-env.md), and [Python libraries for data analysis](../../apps/python-data.md).  If you find something missing, don't hesitate to contact our [Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).\n\nAs Puhti is a shared computing environment, users are restricted in what they can do, for example when it comes to installing customized software or processing sensitive data.  In some cases, it might make sense to instead use [**P\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
