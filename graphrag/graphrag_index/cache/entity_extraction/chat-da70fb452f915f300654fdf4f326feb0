The aggregated HPL Linpack performance\nof LUMI-G is 379.70 PFlop/s.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/lumig-overview.svg\" \n    width=\"800\"\n    alt=\"LUMI-G overview\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Overview of a LUMI-G compute node</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe LUMI-G compute nodes are equipped with four AMD MI250X GPUs based on the\n2nd Gen AMD CDNA architecture. A MI250x GPU is a multi-chip module (MCM) with \ntwo GPU dies named by AMD Graphics Compute Die (GCD). Each of these dies features \n110 compute units (CU) and has access to a 64 GB slice of HBM memory for a total\nof 220 CUs and 128 GB total memory per MI250x module.\n\n!!! note \"GCDs are GPUs for Slurm and the HIP runtime\"\n\n    From a software perspective as well as from the Slurm perspective, one\n    MI250x module is considered as two GPUs. It means the LUMI-G nodes can be\n    considered as 8 GPUs nodes. If you do a `hipGetDeviceCount` runtime call the\n    value returned for a full node will be 8.\n\nMore information about the AMD MI250x can be found here:\n\n- [MI250X information on the AMD website][MI250x-amd]\n- [Applications performance and benchmarks][benchmarks]\n\nThe LUMI-G nodes CPU is a single 64-core AMD EPYC 7A53 \"Trento\" CPU. The cores\nof this CPU are [\"Zen 3\" compute cores][zen3-wiki] supporting AVX2 256-bit\nvector instructions for a maximum throughput of 16 double precision FLOP/clock\n(AVX2 FMA operations). The cores have 32 KiB of private L1 cache, a 32 KiB\ninstruction cache, and 512 KiB of L2 cache. The L3 cache is shared between the\ngroups of eight cores and has a capacity of 32 MiB for a total 256 MiB of L3\ncache per processor. The CPU is configured as 4 NUMA nodes (NPS4), i.e., 128 GiB\nof DDR4 memory per NUMA node for a total of 512 GiB CPU memory.\n\nThe figure below gives a general overview of a LUMI-G node as well as the \ntopology of the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU links.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/lumig-node-overview.svg\" \n    width=\"990\"\n    alt=\"LUMI-G compute node overview\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Overview of a LUMI-G compute node</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe two GCDs in the MI250x modules are connected by an in-package Infinity\nFabric interface that can provide a theoretical peak bidirectional bandwidth of\nup to 400 GB/s. Additionally, GCDs on different MI250x modules are linked with\neither a single or double Infinity Fabric link, which can provide a peak\nbidirectional bandwidth of 100 GB/s and 200 GB/s, respectively.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no direct correlation between the GPU\n(GCD) numbering and the NUMA node numbering. For example, NUMA 0/core 0 is not\nconnected to GPU 0/GCD 0. Properly binding the NUMA node to the GPU might be\ncrucial for achieving optimal performance in your application. The figure below\nillustrates these links from both the CPU and GPU perspectives.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/lumig-cpu-gpu-links.svg\" \n    width=\"900\"\n    alt=\"LUMI-G CPU-GPU links\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>CPU-GPU links from a CPU centric or GPU centric point of view</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nEach MI250x module is directly connected to the slingshot-11 network providing\nup to 25+25 GB/s peak bandwidth.\nDetails about the LUMI network are provided [here][network].\n\nTo summarize, each MI250x modules have 5 GPU-GPU links, 2 CPU-GPU links and 1 \nPCIe links to the slingshot-11 interconnect.\n\n\n## The MI250x Graphics Compute Die\n\nAs mentioned previously, the MI250x GPU modules have two Graphics Compute Dies (GCD).\nEach GCD has 112 physical compute units (CUs), but 2 of these are disabled\nwhich means that 110 CU can actually be used.\nTo boost memory throughput, all CU share a L2 cache.\nThis L2 cache has an 8 MB capacity and is\ndivided in 32 slices capable of delivering 128 B/clock/slice for a total of 6.96\nTB/s peak theoretical bandwidth.\n\nThe L2 cache also improves synchronization capabilities for algorithms that rely\non atomic operations to coordinate communication across an entire GPU.
