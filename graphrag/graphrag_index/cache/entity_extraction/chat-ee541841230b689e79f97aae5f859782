For example,\n\n```bash\ntr \".\" \"\\n\" < authors.txt\n```\n\nwould replace the dots with line breaks in the file `authors.txt`:\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen\n Oulu 50\nMarkus Aho\n Turku 50\nPekka Niemi\n Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen\n Kuopio 32\n```\n\nModifying the file so that all the text is written with upper case\nletters can be done with\n\n```bash\ntr \"[:lower:]\" \"[:upper:]\" < authors.txt\n```\n\nwhich results in\n\n```text\nEEVA PEKKANEN, OULU 50\nMARKUS AHO, TURKU 50\nPEKKA NIEMI, TAMPERE 26\nLEENA VIRTANEN, KUOPIO 32\n```\n\nCheck the manual page of `tr` (`man tr`) to see the list of all special\ncharacters and character sets that `tr` can use.\n\n## Replacing words and strings with `sed`\n\nReplacing text strings can be done with `sed`. `sed` is a stream\neditor that can be used for many text processing operations.\n`sed` reads string data, either from a file or piped from another\ncommand, and does the edit operations defined by the user and then\nprints the edited string to the standard output. `sed` is a very\npowerful tool for automatic text editing, though a bit hard to learn. In\nthis guide we do not provide a general introduction to `sed`, as even a\nmodest overview would take several pages. Instead, we show few practical\nexamples of how `sed` can be used. `sed` is commonly used with the syntax:\n\n```bash\nsed -e sed_script input_file\n```\n\nThe `sed_script` is typically a short formulation that defines what kind\nof editing should be done. For example, to do a replacement operation we\ncould use the `sed` operation `s/\"search string\"/\"replacement string\"/g`.\nIn this formulation `s` means search and replace operation.\nThe `g` in the end of the formulation means that the replacement\noperation is global, i.e. all matching strings will be replaced. You\ncould replace, for example, just the first or second occurrence of the\nsearch string on a row by using number 1 or 2 instead of `g`. For\nexample the operation where Oulu is replaced by Turku in the file\n`authors.txt` can be done with the command\n\n```bash\nsed -e s/\"Oulu\"/\"Turku\"/g authors.txt\n```\n\nwhich results in\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen. Turku 50\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n\nJust like the `grep` command, `sed` interprets the given search string\nas a *regular expression*. This means that some characters are\ninterpreted as special regular expression defining characters. For\nexample, the dot (`.`) is used to define any single character. Thus, the\n`sed` command `s/\".\"/\",\"/g` would change not just dots but all\ncharacters to commas (`,`). In these kinds of situations you can use the\n*backslash* character (`\\`) to tell the `sed` command that the following\ncharacter should not be interpreted as part of a regular expression. On\nthe other hand, using the regular expressions can make `sed` very\neffective. Below are some regular expression examples applied to the\n`authors.txt` file with `sed`.\n\n### `sed` example 1\n\nUsing the `$` character to define the end of a line (note\nthe single quotation marks (`'`) that prevent the `$` character to be\ninterpreted as a bash variable indicator):\n\n```bash\nsed -e s/'0$'/\"1 changed\"/g authors.txt\n```\n\nPrints out:\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 51 changed\nMarkus Aho. Turku 51 changed\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n\n### `sed` example 2\n\nUsing dot (`.`) to define any single character:\n\n```bash\nsed -e s/\"e.a\"/\"EXA\"/g authors.txt\n```\n\nPrints out:\n\n```text\nEEXA Pekkanen. Oulu 50\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeEXA Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n\n### `sed` example 3\n\nUsing `^` to define the beginning of a line.\n\n```bash\nsed -e s/\"^P\"/\"START:P\"/g authors.txt\n```\n\nPrints out:\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\nSTART:Pekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
