These basis gates are the actual quantum gates on the quantum computer. The process of decomposition involves turning the above Hadamard and controlled-x gates into something that can be physically run on the quantum computer. Helmi's basis gates are the two-qubit controlled-z and a the one-qubit rotational gate around the x-y plane. In Qiskit these are defined in the backend and can be printed with `backend.operation_names`. \n\n```python\ncircuit_decomposed = transpile(circuit, backend=backend)\n```\nYou can also print your circuit like before with `print(circuit_decomposed.draw())` to see what it looks like! \n\n### *Optional* Qubit Mapping\n\nThis is an optional step but may be useful to extracting the best out of the quantum computer. This is a python dictionary which simply states which qubits in the Quantum register should be mapped to which *physical* qubit.\n\n```python\nqubit_mapping = {\n                qreg[0]: 0,\n                qreg[1]: 2,\n            }\n```\n\nHere we are mapping the first qubit in the quantum register to the first of Helmi's qubits, QB1, located at the zeroth location due to Qiskit's use of zero-indexing. The second qubit is then mapped to QB3. This is where we have made use of Helmi's topology. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"../../../../img/helmi_mapping.png\" alt=\"Helmi's node mapping\">\n</p>\n\n\nThe two qubit Controlled-X gate we implemented in our circuit is currently on the second of our two qubits in the Quantum register, `qreg[1]`. Due to Helmi's topology this needs to be mapped to QB3 on Helmi. The 1 qubit Hadamard gate can be mapped to any of the *outer* qubits, QB1, QB2, QB4, QB5, here we choose QB1. \n\nNote that this step is entirely optional. Using the `execute` function automatically does the mapping based on the information stored in the backend. Inputting the qubit mapping simply gives more control to the user. \n\n### Submitting the job\n\nNow we can run our quantum job!\n\n```python\njob = execute(circuit, backend, shots=shots)\n# Optional input the qubit mapping\n# job = execute(circuit, backend, shots=shots, initial_layout=mapping)\n```\n\n### Results\n\nBefore submitting we need to ensure we can get some results! The quantum job will return what are called **counts**. Counts are the accumulation of results from the 1000 times the circuit is submitted to the QPU. Each time the circuit is submitted a binary *state* is returned, this is then added to the tally.  In this case as we are submitting a 2 qubit circuit there are 4 possible resulting states: `00, 11, 01, 10`.  The expected results should be that approximately 50% of the counts should be in state `00` and 50% in state `11`. The states of the qubits are thus entangled: if one of the qubits is measured to be in state |0>, the other one will immediately also collapse to the same state, and vice versa. As real quantum computers are not perfect, you will most likely also see that some measurements find the states |01> and |10>.\n\nTo print your results add:\n\n```python\ncounts = job.result().get_counts()\nprint(counts)\n```\n\nYou can also print the entirety of `job.result()` which will contain all the information about your jobs results. \n\n## Save your file\n\nOnce you've made your first quantum program remember to save! CTRL+X then Y to save your file. \n\n## Running the job through LUMI\n\nTo run your quantum programme on LUMI you will need to submit the job through the SLURM batch scheduler on LUMI. Accessing Helmi is done through the `q_fiqci` partition. In the same directory where you have saved your quantum program, you can submit the job to SLURM using:\n\n```bash\nsrun --account project_xxx -t 00:15:00 -c 1 -n 1 --partition q_fiqci python -u first_quantum_job.py\n```\n\nRemember to add your own project account!\n\nThis submits the job *interactively* meaning that the output will be printed straight to the terminal screen. If you wish you can also submit it using `sbatch` using this skeleton batch script. Using `nano` as before create the script `batch_script.sh`. \n\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n\n#SBATCH --job-name=helmijob   # Job name\n#SBATCH --output=helmijob.o%j # Name of stdout output file\n#SBATCH --error=helmijob.e%j  # Name of stderr error file\n#SBATCH --partition=q_fiqci   # Partition (queue) name\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1              # One task (process)\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G       # memory allocation\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1     # Number of cores (threads)\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00         # Run time (hh:mm:ss)\n#SBATCH --account=project_xxx  # Project for billing\n\nmodule use /appl/local/quantum/modulefiles\nmodule load helmi_qiskit\n\npython -u first_quantum_job.py\n```\nThis can be submitted with `sbatch batch_script.sh` in the same directory as your python file. Jobs in the SLURM queue can be monitored through `squeue -u username` and after the job has completed your results can be found\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
