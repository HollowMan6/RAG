However, in many cases, \nusing Allas directly trough S3 or Swift is limited by the rather plain structure \nof user management and by the fact that the access is based on personal CSC user accounts.\n\nUsing Nextcloud server as a front end allows you to create and manage your own user \nbase for your Allas storage area and control the access to different datasets and storage areas. \nFurther, Nextcloud provides several user interfaces (including a WWW-interface and a cell phone app) \nthat are often easier to use and more flexible to use that native Swift or S3 applications.\n\nIn this document we show a simple use case with the following steps:\n\n   1. Launch a new Ubuntu18 Virtual Machine\n   2. Install a Nextcloud server into the new VM\n   3. Link The Nextcloud server is linked to a data bucket in Allas\n   4. New Nextcloud user account is created for an external user\n\n## 1. Launch a new Ubuntu18 Virtual Machine\n\nFirst, launch a new Ubuntu18 based server in cPouta service. \nSee instructions in the [cPouta documentation](../../../cloud/pouta/) and\nin [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvoN4pv0RJQ).\n\nIn most cases the combination of “standard small” flavor and Ubuntu18.04 image is sufficient.\n\nWhen you create the security group for the VM, the instructions above show how \nport 22 is opened for ssh access. In this case, use the same procedure to open \nport 443 (https), too, as it will be used to access the Nextcloud server.\n\n\n## 2. Setting up a Next Cloud sever in the VM\n\nOpen a terminal connection to your server (ssh or Putty) to install the Nextcloud server.\nFirst, it is good to update the Ubuntu system:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\n```\nIn this example we use _snap_ as it provides an easy way to install Nextcloud.\nYou can do the installations with just few commands.\n\nFirst do the next-cloud installation with command:\n```bash\nsudo snap install nextcloud\n```\nThen, Nextcloud administration account is created. In the command below the account name is\ndefined to be _ncadmin_ with password _1Hu9kgFsN_.\n```bash\nsudo nextcloud.manual-install ncadmin 1Hu9kgFsN\n```\nNext you need to enable https with self signed certificate. Self signed certificates are sufficient for testing, but \nfor production you should use real certificates (e.g. lets-encrypt instead of self-signed).\n```bash\nsudo nextcloud.enable-https self-signed\n```\n\nAs a last step. add the IP-address of your Nextcloud server to the list of trusted domains. The IP-address is the Floating IP address \nthat you assigned for the VM and that you used to open the terminal connection. \nFor example the case of IP:86.50.252.77 the definition could be done with command:\n```bash\nsudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=86.50.252.77\n```\n\nNow you should be able to connect your Nextcoud server running in _https://ip-of-your-VM_\n\nSo in this example: _https://86.50.252.77_\n\n\nIf the connection web interface fails check that:\n\n*   you are using the right protocol and ip address\n*   port number 443 and your local IP address (not the server IP) is defined in the cPouta security group and that this security group is in use\n*   your browser accepts self-signed certificates\n \n\nNextcloud software is modular, it can be extended with Nextcloud Apps. Once you have the\nNextcloud up and running, it is a good practice to check what Apps are enabled and how\ndifferent features are configured to work. You can do this in the Nextcloud user interface\nwhen you are logging in as admin. If you wish, you can also start this by running a CSC\nprovided script that disables a few and configures some Apps in order to make the Nextcloud\nless overloaded with features for this kind of Allas front end testing. The script can be\ndownloaded and run like this:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/master/nextcloud_snap/clean_nextcloud_snap >clean_nextcloud_snap\nchmod +x clean_nextcloud_snap\n./clean_nextcloud_snap\n```\n\n\n## 3. Link Nextcloud to a bucket in Allas\n\nTo be able to link Allas to your Nextcloud server, you must have a valid S3 key pair and a ready made data bucket in Allas. The bucket can be empty or it can already contain some data objects.\n\nYou can do this things for example in puhti.csc.fi with commands:\n\n### 1. Setting up the connection:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf --mode s3cmd\n```\n\n### 2. Creating a new empty bucket\n\n```bash\ns3cmd mb s3://your-proj-num-nextcloud\n```\nIn this example we are using project 2001234 so\nthe bucket name could be:\n\n```text\n2001234-nextcloud\n```\n\n### 3. Printing out the keys\n\n```bash\ngrep key $HOME/.s3cfg\n```\n\nNow return to the Nextcloud WWW-interface and log in as the admin. \nClick the round symbol on the right end of the blue menu bar and select _+Apps_ from the pop-up menu.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
