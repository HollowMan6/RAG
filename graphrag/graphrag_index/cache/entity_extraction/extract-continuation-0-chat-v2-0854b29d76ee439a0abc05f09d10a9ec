By starting\nthe workers using the `srun` command, we create one worker per Slurm task. We also\nwait for all workers to connect, which is generally good practice as we can notice\nissues with the workers early.\n\n```bash\n# Start the workers in the background.\nsrun --overlap --cpu-bind=none --mpi=none hq worker start \\\n    --manager slurm \\\n    --on-server-lost finish-running \\\n    --cpus=\"$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\" &\n\n# Wait until all workers have started\nhq worker wait \"$SLURM_NTASKS\"\n```\n\n**Computing tasks**\n\nNow we can submit tasks with `hq submit` to the server, which executes them on the\navailable workers. It is a non-blocking command; thus, we do not need to run it in\nthe background. Regarding file I/O, we turn off output by setting `--stdout=none`\nand `--stderr=none`. Otherwise, HyperQueue will create output files for each task,\nwhich can create excess I/O on the parallel filesystem when there are many tasks.\nAfter submitting all the tasks, we wait for them to complete to synchronize the script.\n\n```bash\n# Submit tasks to workers\nhq submit --stdout=none --stderr=none --cpus=1 --array=1-1000 ./task\n\n# Wait for all the tasks to finish\nhq job wait all\n```\n\nIt is worth reading the sections about\n[Jobs and Tasks](https://it4innovations.github.io/hyperqueue/stable/jobs/jobs/)\nand [Task Arrays](https://it4innovations.github.io/hyperqueue/stable/jobs/arrays/)\nto understand the different ways to run computations with HyperQueue. For more\ncomplex task dependencies, we can use HyperQueue as the executor for other workflow\nmanagers, such as [Snakemake](#using-snakemake-with-hyperqueue) or\n[Nextflow](#using-nextflow-with-hyperqueue).\n\n**Stopping the workers and the server**\n\nOnce we are done running all of our tasks, we shut down the workers and server to\navoid a false error from Slurm when the job ends.\n\n```bash\n# Shut down the workers and server\nhq worker stop all\nhq server stop\n```\n\n### Using local disks with HyperQueue\n\nWe can use [temporary local disk areas](../computing/disk.md#temporary-local-disk-areas)\nwith HyperQueue to perform I/O intensive tasks. Since a HyperQueue task can run on any\nallocated node, the local disk of each node must have a copy of all the files that the\ntask may use. A typical workflow consists of\n\n1. Copying and extracting archived input files from the parallel file system to\n   the local disk.\n2. Computing the HyperQueue tasks (`hq submit`) that use the local disk.\n3. Archiving and copying the output files from the local disk to the parallel file\n   system.\n\nFor steps 1 and 3, we can run an `<executable>` on each allocated node as a Slurm\njob step as follows:\n\n```bash\nsrun -m arbitrary -w \"$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST\" <executable>\n```\n\nWithout the options, `srun` would run the executable on every Slurm task, which\ncould be on the same node. The `srun` command can be omitted if only a single node\nis requested.\n\n### Complete example scripts for Puhti\n\n=== \"Single node\"\n\n    File: `task`\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    echo \"Hello from task $HQ_TASK_ID!\" > \"output/$HQ_TASK_ID.out\"\n    sleep 1\n    ```\n\n    File: `batch.sh`\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=small\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10\n    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n    #SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n\n    module load hyperqueue\n\n    # Specify a location and create a directory for the server\n    export HQ_SERVER_DIR=\"$PWD/hq-server/$SLURM_JOB_ID\"\n    mkdir -p \"$HQ_SERVER_DIR\"\n\n    # Start the server in the background and wait until it has started\n    hq server start &\n    until hq job list &> /dev/null ; do sleep 1 ; done\n\n    # Start the workers in the background\n    srun --overlap --cpu-bind=none --mpi=none hq worker start \\\n        --manager slurm \\\n        --on-server-lost finish-running \\\n        --cpus=\"$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\" &\n\n    # Wait until all workers have started\n    hq worker wait \"$SLURM_NTASKS\"\n\n    # Create a directory for output files\n    mkdir -p output\n\n    # Submit tasks to workers\n    hq submit --stdout=none --stderr=none --cpus=1 --array=1-1000 ./task\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to finish\n    hq job wait all\n\n    # Shut down the workers and server\n    hq worker stop all\n    hq server stop\n    ```\n\n=== \"Multinode + local disk\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm is a workload manager used for allocating resources, managing jobs, and providing a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work on a set of allocated nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HyperQueue is a tool for managing and executing computing tasks on a distributed set of workers, allowing for efficient task submission and resource utilization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snakemake is a workflow management system that allows the creation of complex bioinformatics workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXTFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nextflow is a workflow framework that simplifies the writing of data-intensive computational pipelines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science, providing high-performance computing resources)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>SLURM<|>HyperQueue utilizes Slurm for managing and executing tasks on allocated resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>HyperQueue can be used as an executor for Snakemake workflows, integrating with its task management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>NEXTFLOW<|>HyperQueue can be used as an executor for Nextflow workflows, facilitating efficient task execution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>PUHTI<|>HyperQueue is utilized on the Puhti supercomputer for executing computing tasks, demonstrating its application in high-performance computing environments<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
