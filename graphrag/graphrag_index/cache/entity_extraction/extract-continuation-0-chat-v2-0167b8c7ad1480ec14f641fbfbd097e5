When you use Allas with these encryption tools, remember that:\n   \n   1. You can store encrypted sensitive data in Allas, but are allowed to decrypt it only in environments with a high enough security level. For example, the CSC HPC environment (i.e. Puhti, Mahti, LUMI) is **not** secure enough for sensitive data.\n   \n   2. You should use strong enough encryption passwords and keep them safe.  \n   \n   3. If you forget the encryption password, the data is lost. CSC can't provide you a new password to read your data as the password was set by you, not CSC.\n   \n   \n## 1. Encrypting a single file or directory with `a-put`\n  \nIf you install [allas-cli-utils](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/) to the machine you are using, you can use `a-put` with option _--encrypt_ to encrypt the file or directory you want to upload to Allas. You can use either symmetric (i.e. password) encryption with [**gpg**](https://gnupg.org/) or asymmetric key based encryption with [**crypt4gh**](https://crypt4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Gpg is available in most linux systems while crypt4gh is not so widely used so you may need to install it to your local system if you wish to use asymmetric encryption.\n\nNote, that by default `a-put` creates an additional metadata object that contains information about the uploaded files. When _--encrypt_ option is used, the actual data content will be encrypted, but the metadata objects (the _\\_ameta_ files) will not be encrypted. In cases where the file names should not be stored in readable format, you should turn off the metadata object creation by using `a-put` with option _--no-ameta_.\n\n\n### Symmetric gpg encryption\n\nSymmetric gpg encryption can be executed with command:\n \n```text\na-put --encrypt gpg data_dir -b my_allas_bucket\n``` \nWhen option _--encrypt gpg_ is in use the data is encrypted with `gpg` command using _AES256_ encryption algorithm, that generally considered good enough for sensitive data. When you launch the command it will ask for encryption password, and password confirmation. In this approach only the content of the file or directory is encrypted. Object name and metadata remain in human readable format. \n\nWhen you retrieve the data with `a-get`, you will be asked for the encryption password so that the object can be decrypted after download.\n\n```text\na-get my_allas_bucket/data_dir.tar.zst.gpg\n```\n\n### Asymmetric crypt4gh encryption\n\nIf you want to use asymmetric `crypt4gh` encryption, you need to have a public key file for encryption and a secret key file for decryption.\nIn Puhti, you first need to make `crypt4gh` available with the command:\n```text\nmodule load allas\n```\nNow you can create keys with a command like: \n```text\ncrypt4gh-keygen --sk allaskey.sec --pk allaskey.pub\n```\nData can now be uploaded to Allas with command:\n```text\na-put --encrypt c4gh --pk allaskey.pub data_dir -b my_allas_bucket\n```\nThe command above first encrypts the data using `crypt4gh` and the public key and then uploads the encrypted data to Allas. Note, that you don't need the secret key for encryption. You can deliver the public key to a another server (and to another user) so that data can be securely uploaded to Allas from an external secure location. Secret key is needed only in the environment where to data is downloaded to from Allas:\n```text\na-get --sk allaskey.sec my_allas_bucket/data_dir.tar.zst.c4gh\n```\nThe command above will download the encrypted object from Allas, ask for the password of the secret key and the unpack then data into readable files. \n\n\n## 2. Creating encrypted repository with rclone\n \n`rclone` has a client side encryption feature that allows you create an encrypted data repository to Allas. In this approach, you need to once define an encrypted `rclone` connection to Allas, and when this connection is used, all the transported data will be automatically encrypted. The automatic encryption of `rclone` is based on the _Salsa20_ stream cipher. Salsa20 is not as widely used as AES256, but it is one of the encryption tools that were recommended by the European [eSTREAM](https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/) project.\n\nIn the example here, we assume that you are using a server where you have [rclone](https://rclone.org/) and [allas-cli-utils](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/) installed. First, you have to configure a normal, un-encrypted swift-connection to Allas. This can be done with the `allas-conf` script that is included in _allas-cli-utils_ package:\n```text\nsource allas\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a storage platform not certified for high-level security, recommended for storing encrypted sensitive data\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service providing web and command line interfaces for automatically encrypting data stored to Allas\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC HPC ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Includes Puhti, Mahti, LUMI, not secure enough for sensitive data\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for symmetric encryption, using AES256 algorithm, available in most Linux systems\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for asymmetric key based encryption, not widely used and may require installation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command line program to manage files on cloud storage, supports client-side encryption\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>SD CONNECT SERVICE<|>SD Connect is recommended for encrypting data before storing it on Allas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC HPC ENVIRONMENT<|>CSC HPC environments are not secure enough for decrypting sensitive data stored on Allas<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>GPG<|>GPG can be used for encrypting data before storing it on Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CRYPT4GH<|>Crypt4GH can be used for encrypting data before storing it on Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>RCLONE<|>Rclone can be used for creating an encrypted data repository on Allas<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
