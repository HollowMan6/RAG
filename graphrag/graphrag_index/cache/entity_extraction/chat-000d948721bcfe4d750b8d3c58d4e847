The new version will also be available in RStudio in the Puhti web interface shortly.\n\n## Schrödinger Maestro 2023.2, 25.5.2023\n\nSchrödinger Maestro version 2023.2 has been installed and set as the default module on\nPuhti and Mahti. See [release notes](https://www.schrodinger.com/releases/new-features/)\nfor a list of new features and improvements.\n\n## NoMachine will no longer be available on CSC's supercomputers, 9.5.2023\n\nThe NoMachine remote desktop service will be discontinued on 25th May 2023, at the end of the\ncurrent licensing period. The service is superseded by web interfaces on CSC's supercomputers. The\nfirst of them, [Puhti web interface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md), has been liked by the\nresearchers, the number of users is still rapidly increasing and now represents 36% of all users.\nSimilar web interfaces will be opened for both Mahti and LUMI, in the near future. For replacements\nin specific use cases, please see\n[the application page for NoMachine](../../apps/nomachine.md#replacements).\n\n## Gromacs and CP2K now available on LUMI, 19.4.2023\n\nCPU and GPU-enabled versions of [Gromacs](../../apps/gromacs.md) and [CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md)\nhave been installed on LUMI. Before loading the modules, first take the CSC module tree into\nuse with `module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles`. Note that the GPU-enabled Gromacs version\nis an unofficial HIPified fork of the software by AMD and hence unsupported by the upstream\ndevelopers.\n\n## PyTorch 2.0 and TensorFlow 2.12, 27.3.2023\n\n[PyTorch](../../apps/pytorch.md) 2.0 and\n[TensorFlow](../../apps/tensorflow.md) 2.12 are now available on Puhti and Mahti. \nSee [PyTorch 2.0 blog post](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-2.0-release/) or the\n[TensorFlow 2.12 release notes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.12.0).\n\n## Turbomole 7.7, 3.3.2023\n\n[Turbomole](../../apps/turbomole.md) 7.7 has been installed and set as the default module on Puhti\nand Mahti. [See release notes here](https://www.turbomole.org/turbomole/release-notes-turbomole-7-7/).\n\n## Schrödinger Maestro 2023.1 and module removal policy, 10.2.2023\n\n* The latest version of [Schrödinger Maestro](../../apps/maestro.md) (v2023.1)\n  has been installed and set as the default module on CSC supercomputers.\n  See [release notes](https://www.schrodinger.com/releases/new-features/)\n  for a list of new features and improvements.\n* Henceforth, a two-year cleaning cycle is applied on the Maestro modules on CSC\n  supercomputers. Specifically, module versions older than two years will be removed\n  in order to free up disk space and encourage use of the latest versions which tend\n  to be more performant and have less bugs.\n\n## CSC software collection on LUMI, 31.1.2023\n\nApplications pre-installed by CSC on the LUMI supercomputer can now be viewed in the\n[application list grouped by availability](../../apps/by_system.md). For a comprehensive\nlist of available EasyBuild recipes for personal or project-specific installations, see\nthe [LUMI Software Library](https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/).\n\n## CP2K 2023.1, 30.1.2023\n\n[CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md) 2023.1 has been installed and set as the default module on Puhti\nand Mahti. [See release notes here](https://www.cp2k.org/version_history).\n\n## Gromacs 2022.4, 16.1.2023\n\n[Gromacs](../../apps/gromacs.md) 2022.4 has been installed and set as the default module on Puhti\nand Mahti. [See release notes here](https://manual.gromacs.org/2022.4/release-notes/2022/2022.4.html).\n\n## License for Materials and Discovery Studio no longer available, 3.1.2023\n\nThe national [Materials Studio](../../apps/materialsstudio.md) and\n[Discovery Studio](../../apps/discovery-studio.md) licenses provided by CSC ended at the end of 2022.\nPlease consider using, e.g., [Maestro](../../apps/maestro.md) or [AMS](../../apps/ams.md)\ninstead.\n\n## sbatch-hq, 19.12.2022\n\nA wrapper for HyperQueue called `sbatch-hq` has been created to enable easy and efficient\ntask farming, *i.e.* high-throughput computing workflows where the intention is to run many\nsimilar (non-MPI parallel, independent) commands/programs.
