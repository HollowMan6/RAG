Before proceeding, contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md), *(subject: Sensitive Data)* to ensure optimal use, as limited resources require careful planning.\n\n## 3. Add an external volume\n\n* Attach an external volume (virtual external hard drive) to your virtual desktop, extending default storage (80 GB) up to 200 GB. Choose *Volume size* (recommended: 50 GB for small computing, 100 GB for medium, 200 GB for heavy computation) and assign a name in the *Volume name* -field [(See screenshot)](images/desktop/SD-Desktop_Volume.png){ target=\"_blank\" }.\n\n* **It's advisable to save critical analyses or files on the volume, which can also serve as a backup if the virtual desktop becomes unresponsive.** Note that after the virtual desktop is created, disk space/volume extension requires contacting [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md), *(subject: Sensitive Data)*. \n\n* **You can detach and attach a volume from your virtual desktop** on the SD Desktop Management page. This can be compared to connecting/disconnecting a hard drive to your laptop. This feature is available only on desktops created after February 2023. For additional details, refer to: [Managing volume and desktops](./sd-desktop-manage.md).\n\n## 4. Desktop creation\n\n* Finally, press on _Create desktop_. The operation is entirely automated and can take up to 30 minutes. If you try accessing the virtual desktop during this process, an error message will be displayed asking you to return later.\n\n### Screenshots\n=== \"Go to SD Desktop Mangement\"\n    ![Go to SD Desktop Management -button](images/desktop/SD-Desktop_GoToManagement.png)\n=== \"1.

[List of pre-installed softwares](./sd-desktop-software.md#default-software-selection-in-sd-desktop).\n\n* **Delete or pause unused desktops**: Ensure to [delete](./sd-desktop-manage.md#deleting-a-desktop) or [pause](./sd-desktop-manage.md#pausing-or-unpausing-a-virtual-desktop) your desktop when not in use. Unused desktops trigger email notifications after 14 days of inactivity.\n\n* Additional volume or disk space can only be requested by writing to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Sensitive data).\n  \n* **You can detach and attach a volume from your virtual desktop** on the SD Desktop Management page. This can be compared to connecting/disconnecting a hard drive to your laptop. This feature is available only on desktops created after February 2023.
