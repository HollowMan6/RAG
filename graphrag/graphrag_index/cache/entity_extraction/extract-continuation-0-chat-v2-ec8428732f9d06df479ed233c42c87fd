Executable `wtpoa-cns` takes this file as input and produces the final consensus in FASTA. \n\n\nA typical workflow looks like this:\n\n```bash \nwtdbg2 -x rs -g 4.6m -t 16 -i reads.fa.gz -fo prefix\nwtpoa-cns -t 16 -i prefix.ctg.lay.gz -fo prefix.ctg.fa\n```\n\nIn the `wtdbg2` command, `-g` is the estimated genome size and `-x` specifies the sequencing technology, which could take value `rs` for PacBio RSII, `sq` for PacBio Sequel, `ccs` for PacBio CCS reads and `ont` for Oxford Nanopore. This option sets multiple parameters and should be applied before other parameters. When you are unable to get a good assembly, you may need to tune other parameters as described in the wtdbg2 manual.\n\nIn the case of any large (more than 10 Mb) genomes, wtdbg2 assembly process can take several hours or days. On Puhti, such large tasks should always be executed as batch jobs.\n\nBelow is a sample batch job file for assembling _C. elegans_ genome. \n\nThe sample dataset was downloaded from ENA database with commands:\n\n```bash\nenaDataGet SRR5439404 -f fastq\nmv SRR5439404/SRR5439404_subreads.fastq.gz ./\n```\n\nThe actual assembly task was executed with the batch job below:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=wtdbg2\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=12:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --output==wtdbg2_out_32_%j\n#SBATCH --error=wtdbg2_err_32_%j\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n#SBATCH --mem=64G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nmodule load biokit\n\nwtdbg2 -x rs -g100m -t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -i SRR5439404_subreads.fastq.gz -fo c_elegas_test\nwtpoa-cns -t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -i c_elegas_test.ctg.lay.gz -fo c_elegabs.ctg.fa\n```\n\nIn the example above `<project>` should be replaced with your project name. You can use `csc-projects` to check your CSC projects. Maximum running time is set to 12 hours (`--time=12:00:00`). As wtdbg2 uses thread-based parallelization, the process is considered as one job that should be executed within one node (`--ntasks=1`, `--ntasks=1`). The job reserves 32 cores `--cpus-per-task=32` that can use in total up to 64 GB of memory (`--mem=64G`). Note that the number of cores to be used needs to be defined in `wtdbg2` and `wtpoa-cns` commands too. This can be set with the option `-t`. In this case, we use `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` variable that contains the `--cpus-per-task` value (we could as well use `-t 32`, but then we have to remember to change the value if the number of the reserved CPUs is changed later.\n\nThe job is submitted to the batch job system with `sbatch` command. For example, if the batch job\nfile is named `wtdbg2_job.sh`, then the submission command is: \n\n```bash\nsbatch wtdbg2_job.sh \n```\n\nMore information about running batch jobs can be found from the [batch job section of the Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\n## More information\n\n* [wtdbg2 home page](https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WTDBG2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>wtdbg2 is a fast de novo assembly tool for long-read sequence data produced by PacBio or Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU GPLv3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Free to use and open source license under which wtdbg2 is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing environment where wtdbg2 is available for use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PACBIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of the sequencing technologies supported by wtdbg2, known for long-read sequence data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXFORD NANOPORE TECHNOLOGIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of the sequencing technologies supported by wtdbg2, known for long-read sequence data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C.
