The connection to the encrypted bucket could be opened by anyone who has 1) access to the Allas project and 2) has the same settings (including the passwords) in their own rclone configuration file. This is handy in cases where you need an encrypted data storage that can used by several trusted persons and sites. However, this causes potential security concerns as the same passwords are used by several users. Further, in the configuration file the passwords are only _obscured_ but not encrypted.\n\nTo enhance security, the `rclone` configuration file can be encrypted. This can be done by running `rclone conf` command again.\nIn this case select _s_ to go to _Set configuration password_ and then _a_ to add a password. Setting the password has two effects:\n\n  1. The `rclone` configuration file is converted to an encrypted format\n  2. Each time you execute an `rclone` command, you must give the configuration file password, so that `rclone` can read the settings.\n\nThe second feature can be quite annoying, especially if you mostly use the normal, non-encrypted Allas connection. Because of this, it can be more reasonable to create a separate rclone configuration file for the encrypted Allas usage and then, when encryption is needed, define the usage of encrypted configuration file with rclone option _--config_.\n\nFor example:\n\nMake a copy of the existing `rclone` configuration file (before you define the encrypted connection described above).\n\n```text\ncp $HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf $HOME/rc-encrypt.conf\n```\nThen run the `rclone config` command to add the information of the encrypted Allas bucket and then to encrypt the configuration file. You can do the both two steps in one `rclone config` session.\n```text\nrclone config --config $HOME/rc-encrypt.conf\n```\nThe configuration file encryption key can and should be personal. \n\nNow you can use your protected configuration file with `rclone` command. For example:\n\n```text\nrclone copy --config $HOME/rc-encrypt.conf job_6 allas-crypt:job_6\n```\n\n\n## Restic - Backup tool that includes encryption\n\n[Restic](https://restic.net/) is a backup program that can use Allas as storage space for the backuped data. In stead of importing the data directly, `restic` stores the data as a collection hash. This feature enables effective storage of datasets that include small changes. Thus, different versions of a dataset can be stored so that in the case of a new dataset version, only the changes compared to the previous version needs to be stored. This approach also enables retrieving not just the latest version, also earlier versions of the backuped data. \n\nIn addition to hashing, `restic` encrypts the data using AES256 cipher.
