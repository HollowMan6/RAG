Providing comprehensive metadata according to your discipline's conventions makes your data discoverable and reusable.\n\n### Get identifiers for your data\n\nData used in research and publications should be uniquely identifiable. Make sure the data repository you use provides your data with a [persistent identifier](publishing-datasets.md#persistent-identifiers) (e.g. DOI, URN). Use your dataset's identifier when sharing it and using it so it collects data citations for you.\n\n### Take care of storage\n\n[Deposit your data](publishing-datasets.md#where-to-host-and-publish-datasets) in a well-established repository provided by a trusted party to ensure that your data is safely stored. Take note of the data policy of your organization and the requirements from funding bodies and journals. Consider where other researchers in your community are storing their data, what services the repositories provide and what needs you have in terms of e.g. storage quota and of data openness.\n\n### Open your data\n\nData sharing is increasingly required by funding agencies and journals as it benefits the scientific community at large. It is also beneficial for data collectors as it is associated with increased visibility, collaboration and credit. You should consider sharing your data so that others can access and cite it. Equip your data with an established [license](publishing-datasets.md#licensing-rights) (e.g. Creative Commons licenses) so the others know what they can and cannot do with the data.\n\n!!! note \"Additional readings and resources on data management\"\n    - [Data management checklist](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/why-fairdata/data-management-checklist/) on the [Fairdata.fi](http://fairdata.fi/) website\n    - The Finnish Social Science Data Archive's [Data Management Guidelines](http://www.fsd.uta.fi/aineistonhallinta/en/)\n    - The Academy of Finland [Open Science pages](https://www.aka.fi/en/research-funding/responsible-science/open-science/)\n    - The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit, [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), is an online guide containing good data management practices throughout the data life cycle\n    - [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/) A curated, informative and educational resource on data and metadata standards, interrelated to databases and data policies.\n    - [CSC's videos on Research Data Management](https://video.csc.fi/playlist/details/0_xtsuml9w)  \n\n\n## Budgeting Research Data Management\n\nThe processes of data management may incur costs. Researchers should plan to address these costs and the allocation of resources in the early planning phases of the project. The majority of funders accept data management as a legitimate cost that can and should be accounted for in the project budget.\n\nEstimate the resources needed to manage, share and preserve the data. Consider the additional computational facilities and resources that need to be accessed.\n\nBudgeting and costing for your project is often dependent upon institutional resources, services, and policies. Remember to consult your organisation’s data support office.\n\n!!! note \"Examples of possible data management costs\"\n    \n    - Will there be costs involved in storing the data? Will you need additional server space or tailored solutions?\n    - Are you planning to use commercial services for example for anonymising data, transcribing audio material, or using an electronic laboratory notebook?\n    - Will you need additional paid help for organising and documenting data; are your data files, sheets etc. stored in uniform format and clearly named and well organised and understandable? Higher costs will apply if organising data has been neglected during the project. \n    - When you archive and open data, will there be costs involved?\n\nRead more about [CSC free-of-charge use cases and pricing](https://research.csc.fi/pricing-and-resources).\n\n\n## How to manage sensitive data\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) outlines the principles on sensitive data processing, without giving exact technical details on how to process sensitive data. You can learn about sensitive data more from [CSC's definition of sensitive data](https://research.csc.fi/en/definition-of-sensitive-data). At this point only certain basic rules regarding sensitive personal data are highlighted.\n\n  1. Minimize the data. This means that you should only process the data that is absolutely needed. \n  2. Anonymize or pseudonymizse the data whenever possible. \n  3. Encrypt the data.\n  4. Destroy the data you do not need. \n\nRemember to identify and name a\n  - **Data Controller** (e.g. the Principal Investigator alone or together with another person or legal entity), who determines the means and procedures for processing the data, meaning that they control how data is processed and for what purposes.\n  - **Data Processor**, who processes the data on behalf of the controller. \n\n!!! note \"Additional information on sensitive data management\"\n    - [CSC's Sensitive Data Services for Research](https://research.csc.fi/sensitive-data)\n    - [Managing sensitive data](https://research.csc.fi/en/managing-sensitive-data)\n    - [User Guide for Sensitive Data Services for Research](../sensitive-data/index.md)\n    - [Tools for client side encryption for Allas](../Allas/allas_encryption.md)\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/29XmiG5Zj0s\" title=\"Webinar: What are the policies and possibilities for managing your sensitive data?\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n\n**Sources for this best practice review**\n\nGoodman, A., Pepe, A., Blocker, et. al.
