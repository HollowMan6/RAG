Each node is equipped with two Intel\nXeon processors, code name _Cascade Lake_, with 20 cores each running\nat 2,1 GHz. The cores support AVX-512 vector instructions and VNNI\ninstructions for AI _inference_ workloads. The interconnect is based\non Mellanox HDR InfiniBand. The\nnodes are connected with a 100 Gbps HDR100 link, and the topology is a\nfat tree with a blocking factor of approximately 2:1.\n\nThe **Puhti AI** artificial intelligence partition has a total of **80 GPU\nnodes** with a total peak performance of 2,7 petaflops. Each node has\ntwo latest generation Intel Xeon processors, code name _Cascade Lake_,\nwith 20 cores each running at 2,1 GHz. They also have four Nvidia\nVolta V100 GPUs with 32 GB of memory each. The nodes are equipped with\n384 GB of main memory and 3,6 TB of fast local storage. This partition\nis engineered to allow GPU-intensive workloads to scale well across\nmultiple nodes. The interconnect is based on a dual-rail HDR100\ninterconnect network connectivity providing 200 Gbps of aggregate\nbandwidth in a non-blocking fat-tree topology.\n\n\n### Nodes\n\n\n| Name      |  Number of nodes |  Compute       | Cores                  | Memory  | Local disk |\n|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|---------|------------|\n| M         |  484             | Xeon Gold 6230 | 2 x 20 cores @ 2,1 GHz | 192 GiB |            |\n| M-IO      |  48              | Xeon Gold 6230 | 2 x 20 cores @ 2,1 GHz | 192 GiB |  1490 GiB  |\n| L         |  92              | Xeon Gold 6230 | 2 x 20 cores @ 2,1 GHz | 384 GiB |            |\n| L-IO      |  40              | Xeon Gold 6230 | 2 x 20 cores @ 2,1 GHz | 384 GiB |  3600 GiB  |\n| XL        |  12              | Xeon Gold 6230 | 2 x 20 cores @ 2,1 GHz | 768 GiB |  1490 GiB  |\n| BM-IO     |  6               | Xeon Gold 6230 | 2 x 20 cores @ 2,1 GHz | 1,5 TiB |  5960 GiB  |\n| GPU       |  80              | Xeon Gold 6230<br>Nvidia V100  | 2 x 20 cores @ 2,1 GHz<br> 4 GPUs connected with NVLink | 384 GiB<br>4 x 32 GB |  3600 GiB  |\n\nIn addition to the compute nodes above, Puhti has two login nodes with 40 cores and 2900 GiB\n[local disk](disk.md#login-nodes) each.\n\n\n### Storage\n\nPuhti has a 4.8 PB Lustre parallel storage system providing space for\n[home](disk.md#home-directory), [project](disk.md#projappl-directory) and\n[scratch](disk.md#scratch-directory) storages.\n\nCurrent Lustre configuration for Puhti is:\n\n| Storage area | # OSTs | # MDTs |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| home         |  24    |   4    |\n| projappl     |  24    |   4    |\n| scratch      |  24    |   4    |\n\nPlease see [Lustre documentation](lustre.md) for the terminology.\n\nAll the OSTs and MDTs are shared across the storage areas, thus the\nperformance should be similar between them.
