This makes `rsync`\nsuitable for:\n\n1. **Synchronizing folders**. Using `scp` or `cp` would copy and transfer\n   everything, while `rsync` will only copy and transfer the modifications.\n2. **Transferring large files**. `rsync` can be set to save progress, so if the\n   transfer is interrupted, it can be resumed at the same point.\n\nThe basic command syntax of `rsync` is:\n\n```bash\nrsync -options source target\n```\n\nIf the data source or target location is a remote site, it is defined with the\nsyntax:\n\n```bash\nusername@server:/path/on/server\n```\n\nHowever, both the target and source can also be located on the same machine. In\nthat case you can just give directory paths to source and target sites.\n\nThe table below lists the most commonly used options:\n\n|Option      |Argument|Description|\n|------------|--------|-----------|\n|`-r`        |        |Recurse into directories|\n|`-a`        |        |Use archive mode: copy files and directories recursively and preserve access permissions and timestamps|\n|`-v`        |        |Verbose mode|\n|`-z`        |        |Compress|\n|`-e`        |`ssh`   |Specify the remote shell to use|\n|`-n`        |        |Show what files would be transferred|\n|`--partial` |        |Keep partially transferred files|\n|`--progress`|        |Show progress during transfer|\n|`-P`        |        |Same as `--partial --progress`|\n\nSo the command for transferring a local folder to Puhti, while showing the\nprogress and keeping partially transferred files, would for example be:\n\n```bash\nrsync -rP /path/to/local/folder username@puhti.csc.fi:/path/to/target\n```\n\nThis would either:\n\n1. Create a folder on Puhti at `/path/to/target/folder` if the folder was not\n   present before. In this case, everything in the local folder will be\n   transferred.\n2. Synchronize the source and target folders if the folder already exists on\n   Puhti. In this case, only changes we have made will be transferred.\n\nAnd the same thing in reverse:\n\n```bash\nrsync -rP username@puhti.csc.fi:/path/to/target/folder /path/to/local\n```\n\n!!! warning\n    `rsync` will always overwrite any changes made to the target, even if they\n    are newer than the source!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RSYNC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rsync is a data transfer tool that synchronizes folders and transfers large files efficiently by only copying and transferring modifications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a location, possibly a server or computing resource, mentioned as a target or source for data transfer using rsync)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSYNC<|>PUHTI<|>Rsync is used to transfer data to and from Puhti, indicating a functional relationship where Puhti is a target or source in data synchronization activities<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
