Just follow the instructions in the [main R page](r-env.md).\n\n### GDAL and SAGA GIS support\n\nThe `r-env` module includes the following GDAL and SAGA GIS installations.\n\n| Module name (R version) | GDAL version | SAGA GIS version | \n| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | \n| r-env/4.2.1             | 3.5.1        | 8.2.2            | \n\n\n### Parallel computing\n\nSome R packages like __raster__ and __spatial.tools__ include functions that support parallel computing. There is an example of using predict function from raster package in parallel among our [examples](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/raster_predict). \n\nOther than those, you have to parallelize your own R code which can be done with libraries including __snow__ (see the documentation for the [r-env module](r-env.md)).\n\n## Interactive usage\n\nIt is possible to use [RStudio with an interactive session](../support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks.md).\n\n## Using Allas from R\n\nYou can use Allas from R with the package __aws.s3__. You can find CSC examples how to use it [here](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/R/allas/working_with_allas_from_R_S3.R). \n\nIt is also possible to __read__ and __write__ files from and to Allas or other cloud object storage directly with GDAL-based packages such as `sf` and `terra`. Please check our [Using geospatial files directly from cloud, inc Allas tutorial](../support/tutorials/gis/gdal_cloud.md) for instructions and examples.\n\nWith large quantities of data in Allas, consider using [virtual rasters](https://research.csc.fi/virtual_rasters). \n\n## License and acknowledgement\n\nAll packages are licensed under various free and open source licenses (FOSS), see the linked pages above for exact details.\nFor finding out the correct citations for R and different R packages, you can type:\n\n```r\ncitation() # for citing R\ncitation(\"package\") # for citing R packages\n```\n\nPlease acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072531) and the Open Geospatial Information Infrastructure for Research (Geoportti, urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072513) for computational resources and support\".\n\n## References\n\n* [Examples for using R spatial packages for GIS in Puhti](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R), CSC\n* [List of spatial R packages in CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html)\n* [Spatial Data Science](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app/), Edzer Pebesma, Roger Bivand\n* [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/), Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow\n* [Spatial data science with R](https://rspatial.org/index.html), Robert J.
