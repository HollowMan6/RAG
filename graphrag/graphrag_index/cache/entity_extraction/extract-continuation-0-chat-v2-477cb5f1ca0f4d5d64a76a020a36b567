If you have only a small set of hyperparameters to try out then use the methods what are offered in scikit-learn.\n\n**TuneSearchCV** function enables the use of Randomized and Adaptive Search. To switch to adaptive search, change the **search_optimization** argument. By default TuneSearchCV uses Randomized search. Instead of fixed set of hyperparameters, use suitable ranges using Numpy or Scipy functions. Note that different *search_optimization* arguments may have packages dependencies which you have to install if they are missing.\n\n```python\nfrom ray.tune.sklearn import TuneSearchCV \nhyperparameter_grid = { ... } # Set hyperparameter ranges\n\n# Randomized search\ntune_randomized = TuneSearchCV( model, hyperparameter_grid, early_stopping = True, \n                                    search_optimization = 'random',\n                                    max_iters = 10, use_gpu = False, n_jobs = -1 )\n\ntune_bayes      = TuneSearchCV( model, hyperparameter_grid, early_stopping = True, \n                                    search_optimization = 'bayesian',\n                                    max_iters = 10, use_gpu = False, n_jobs = -1 )\n```\n\n### Example using CSC's supercomputers\n\nHere are case examples of doing model selection using Puhti and Mahti. Be sure to assign the number of CPUs **explicitly** in Puhti. In Mahti when you reserve a node, you automatically reserve the max number of CPUs. Also check the documentation for the partition names to use in both Puhti and Mahti.\n\n\n```batch\n# example-slurm.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --time=10:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --mem=64G\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40\n#SBATCH --account=projectname\n\nmodule load python-data/3.9-1\n\nset -xv\npython3 $*\n```\n\n```python\n# hyperparameter_example.py\nfrom ray.tune.sklearn import TuneGridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\n\n\nmodel               = SGDClassifier()\nhyperparameter_grid = { \"loss\": [ 'hinge', 'log', 'modified_huber', 'squared_hinge', 'perceptron' ],\n                        \"max_iter\": [ 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 ],\n                        \"n_iter_no_change\": [ 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 60 ] \n                      }\n\ntune_search = TuneGridSearchCV( model, hyperparameter_grid, early_stopping = True, max_iters = 10, \n                                use_gpu = False, n_jobs = -1 )\n\nX, y = load_digits(n_class=10, return_X_y=True)\n\nXtrain, Xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split( X, y, train_size = 0.90, test_size = .1, random_state = 0 ) # Split chosen arbitrarily\n\ntune_search.fit( Xtrain, ytrain )\nprint( tune_search.best_params_ )\nprint( tune_search.best_score_ )\nprint( tune_search.score( Xtest, ytest ) )\n```\n\n```batch\nsbatch example-slurm.sh hyperparameter_example.py \n```\n\n### More examples\n\nMore examples can be found from <https://github.com/bilbrait/ml-guide-examples>.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TUNESEARCHCV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TuneSearchCV is a function from the Ray Tune library that enables hyperparameter tuning with early stopping and support for both Randomized and Adaptive Search strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SGDCLASSIFIER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SGDClassifier is a linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, a.o.) with stochastic gradient descent training from the scikit-learn library)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is one of CSC's supercomputers used for model selection and other high-performance computing tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is another supercomputer provided by CSC, designed for demanding simulations and analyses in research)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUNESEARCHCV<|>SGDCLASSIFIER<|>TuneSearchCV is used to optimize hyperparameters of the SGDClassifier model<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>TUNESEARCHCV<|>TuneSearchCV can be executed on Puhti supercomputer for model selection tasks<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>TUNESEARCHCV<|>TuneSearchCV can also be run on Mahti supercomputer for high-performance computing tasks<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
