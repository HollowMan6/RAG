You must remove your data from Allas when the research project ends.\n\nThere is no automatic backup processes in Allas. In technical level Allas is very reliable and fault-tolerant, \nbut if you, or some of your project members, remove or overwrite some data in Allas, \nit is permanently lost. Thus, you might consider making a backup copy of your data to some other location.\n\nThis document provides an example of how a research group can use Allas service to receive **sensitive data** from external \ndata provider like a sequencing center. \n\nThe steps 1 (Obtaining storage space in Allas), and 2 (Generating encryption keys) require some work, \nbut they need to be done only once. Once you have the keys in place you can move directly to step 3 when you \nneed to prepare a new shared bucket. \n\n\n## 1. Obtaining a storage space in Allas\n\nIf you are already using Allas service, you can skip this chapter and start from [chapter 2](#2-generating-keys-for-encrypting-sensitive-data).\nOtherwise, do following steps to get access to Allas.\n\n\n### Step 1.1. Create a user account\n\nIf you are not yet CSC customer, register yourself to CSC. You can do these steps in the \nCSCâ€™s customer portal [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi). \n\nCreate a CSC account by logging in to MyCSC with Haka or Virtu. \n\n\n### Step 1.2. Create or join a project\n\nIn addition to CSC user account, new users must either join a CSC computing project \nor set up a new computing project. You can use the same project to access other \nCSC services too like Puhti, cPouta, or SD desktop.\n\nCreate a CSC project in MyCSC and apply access to Allas. See if you are eligible to act as a project manager. \nIf your work belongs to any of the free-of-charge use cases, select 'Academic' as the project type. \nAs a project manager, you can invite other users as members to your project. \n\nIf you wish to be joined to an existing project, please ask the project manager to add your CSC user account to the \nproject member list.\n\n### Step 1.3. Add Allas access for your project\n\nAdd _Allas_ service to your project in MyCSC. Only the project manager can add services. \nAfter you have added Allas to the project, the other project members need to login to \nMyCSC and approve the terms of use for the service before getting access to Allas. \n\nAfter these steps, your project has 10 TB storage space available in Allas. \nPlease [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) if you need more storage space. \nThe data in Allas can be downloaded to your local environment or to CSC computers. \nMore information about different ways to access data in Allas can be found from [Allas user guide](../Allas/index.md).\n\n\n## 2. Generating keys for encrypting sensitive data\n\n### 2.1 What are encryption keys for?\n\nIn case of sensitive research data, for example human nucleotide sequence data, \nthe data needs to be properly encrypted before it can be uploaded to Allas. \nThe CSC Sensitive Data Services encrypts data by default with CSC specific \nkey that can be used only in the CSC environment. If you want to use your \nsensitive data in other locations too you need to create a _Crypt4GH_ compatible key pair \nconsisting of _secret key_ and _public key_ for your own use. You can use the same key pair \nseveral times, and normally it is practical to use the same keys for all data of a project so that \nkey management does not get too complicated. \n\nInstructions for creating _crypt4gh_ compatible keys can be found [here](./sd-connect-upload-for-storage-and-sharing.md).\n(The key generation processes are described in the second steps of graphical user \ninterface and command line client instructions).\nOnce the keys have been generated, you can send the public key to all data producers, \nso that they can then encrypt the data that they will send for you. After that, only the owners \nof the private key, i.e. project members, can decrypt the data.  \n\nThe potential danger with data encryption is that if the secret key or \nits password is lost, the data canâ€™t be decrypted by any means anymore. \nThus, you should store the keys and password so that the information will \nbe preserved also when servers and project members change. On the other hand, \nthe secret key should be moved only to those places where decryption is done,\nand the password should remain unreachable for non-project members.\n\nCSC does not provide an encryption key management system at the moment. If you\ndon't have access to a proper key management system, one solution is to \nstore the secret key and a text file containing the password to _CSC Sensitive \nData environment_ using _SD Connect_ interface. \nThe interface encrypts this data with CSC public key, after which the project members, \nand only them, can use SD Desktop service to check, what were the keys and \npasswords the project uses. \n\nCSC Sensitive Data environment uses _Crypt4GH_ encryption tool that allows \nencryption with several public\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS STORAGE SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A general purpose data storage service maintained by CSC for academic research projects at Finnish universities and research institutes, not intended for data archiving\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC - IT Center for Science provides IT support and resources for academia, research institutes, and companies in Finland\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSCâ€™s customer portal for user registration and project management\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A federation through which users can log into MyCSC and other services using their home organization credentials\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An authentication service used for logging into MyCSC\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC service for computing projects\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC cloud service for computing projects\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC service for accessing sensitive data securely\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Encryption tool compatible with CSC Sensitive Data Services for encrypting sensitive research data\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Interface for storing secret keys and passwords in the CSC Sensitive Data environment securely\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS STORAGE SERVICE<|>CSC<|>Allas Storage Service is maintained by CSC for academic research purposes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYCSC<|>CSC<|>MyCSC is CSC's customer portal for user and project management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAKA<|>MYCSC<|>Haka is used as an authentication method for logging into MyCSC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTU<|>MYCSC<|>Virtu is used as an authentication method for logging into MyCSC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a computing service provided by CSC<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPOUTA<|>CSC<|>cPouta is a cloud service provided by CSC<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>CSC<|>SD Desktop is a service provided by CSC for secure access to sensitive data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA SERVICES<|>Crypt4GH is used by CSC Sensitive Data Services for data encryption<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT<|>SD Connect is used for secure storage of encryption keys within the CSC Sensitive Data environment<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
