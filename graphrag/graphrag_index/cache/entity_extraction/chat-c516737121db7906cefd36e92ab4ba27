By default, users need to import and index themselves the reference genomes they are using.\n\nThe Chipster server, however, contains indexes for a set of commonly used reference organisms for several aligners.\n\nThe genome data and indexes used in Chipster are based on the data available in Ensembl and Ensembl genomes databases. \nHowever, in Chipster, only those sequences (chromosomes) that have been assigned to a karyotype, are included. \nFurther, in GTF files negative location values are removed.\n\nThus, the data downloaded from Chipster server may, in some cases, differ from the data obtained directly from Ensembl.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source.\n \n## Available\n\nAvailable in Puhti.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe `chipster_genomes` tool is included in the `biokit` module, so to make it available, you must first run the set-up command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nAfter that, you can use `chipster_genomes` command. This command needs two parameters:\n\n* File or index type (bed, gtf, fasta, bowtie, bowtie2, BWA, Hisat2, TopHat2)\n* Species name\n\nIf the command is launched without any arguments, it first lists the available data types and asks to select one of them.\nThen the species available for the given datatype are listed, and the tool asks the user to select one of them.\n\n```bash\nchipster_genomes\n```\n\nThe data type can, alternatively, be given as the first argument and the species name as the second argument.\nFor example, the BWA indexes of Danio_rerio.GRCz11 can be retrieved with the command:\n\n```bash\nchipster_genomes bwa Danio_rerio.GRCz11\n```\n\nNote that as the index files may be rather large, you should normally download the data to your `/scratch` disk area.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
