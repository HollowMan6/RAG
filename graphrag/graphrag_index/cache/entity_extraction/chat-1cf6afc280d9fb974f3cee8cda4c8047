In the second example, the files `output1.dat`\nand `output2.dat` are copied to an existing directory called `results`.\nThe command `mv` (move) is used to rename or move a file to\nanother location. For example:\n\n```bash\nmv output.dat output_copy.dat\nmv output1.dat output2.dat results/ \n```\n\nwould create the same new files as the `cp` example commands. However, in the\ncase of `mv`, the original files `output.dat`, `output1.dat` and\n`output2.dat` would be removed from the current working directory.\n\nFiles are removed using the command `rm filename`. By default, the file is\ndeleted immediately. If you would like to first confirm file deletion, you can\nadd a parameter to the command: `rm -i`.  To make this behavior permanent, you\ncan set an alias in your `.bashrc`:\n\n```bash\nalias rm=\"rm -i\"\n```\n\nNote that after editing your `.bashrc` file, you need to use the\n`source ~/.bashrc` command or open a new shell. After that, the `rm` command\nwill always ask the user to confirm that they really want to remove the\nfile:\n\n```bash\n$ rm output_copy.dat\nrm: remove output_copy.dat (yes/no)?\n```\n\nYou can answer `y` (yes) or `n` (no). Note that this confirmation step\nis not necessarily in use in your local Linux environment or currently in\nPuhti. You can skip the confirmation query using the option `-f`, standing for\n*force*. However, you should use this option with caution as the `rm` command\nwill remove the file immediately and permanently!\n\n## Special characters\n\nSome characters have special functions in Linux. In the following\nparagraphs, we present the characters that are used for redirecting standard\ninput and output or used as the so-called *wildcard characters*.\n\nThe `$` sign that serves as an indicator of a variable name, the `#`\nsymbol that is used to place comments, and the different kind of quotation\nmarks are discussed later on in the\n[linux scripting chapter](linux-bash-scripts.md).\n\n### Commonly used special characters\n\n| Character | Function                                                        |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `$`       | Indicates a shell or environment variable                       |\n| `|`       | Pipes standard output to the standard input of the next command |\n| `#`       | Starts a comment                                                |\n| `&`       | Executes a process in the background                            |\n| `?`       | Matches one character                                           |\n| `*`       | Matches any string (including an empty string)                  |\n| `>`       | Output redirection operator                                     |\n| `<`       | Input redirection operator                                      |\n| `>>`      | Output redirection operator (to append to a file)               |\n| `\\`       | Ignore the possible special function of the following character |\n\n### Wildcard characters\n\nIn Linux, a question mark (`?`) and an asterisk (`*`) are used as the so-called \nwildcard characters. They can be used to define arguments that\nmatch many files or directories. When given as command arguments, the\n`?` sign is interpreted as *any single character* and `*` sign as *any\nstring of characters*. For example,\n\n```bash\nls test?.input \n```\n\nwould produce a list of files that begin with `test` and end with `.input`\nand have exactly one character in between. Thus, the files with names\n`testA.input` and `test4.input` would be listed, but filenames like\n`test10.input` or `testOld.input` would be ignored. Instead, the command\n\n```bash\nls test*.input \n```\n\nwould list all files mentioned above as `*` matches any string.\nHere, the only limitations would be that the command must start with the\nstring `test` and end with string `.input`.\n\n### Redirecting standard input and output\n\nThe characters *less than* (`<`), *greater than* (`>`), `>>`\nand *pipe* (`|`) are used to control the standard input and output. The\n*less than* symbol (`<`) instructs the command to read data \nfrom a file defined after that `<` character instead of reading from the\nkeyboard.\n\nThe *greater than* character (`>`) would redirect the output of a command to\na new file instead of the display (standard output). For example, the command\n\n```bash\nls test*.input > input_files\n```\n\nwould produce a new file called `input_files` that would contain the\nnames of files that start with the string `test` and end with `.input`.\nUsing two *greater than* signs with no space between them (`>>`)\nwould append the results of a command to the end of an existing file or,\nif the file does not exist yet, direct the output to a new file with the\nspecified filename.\n\nThe pipe character (`|`) redirects the output of the command\nas input for the next command. In this way, you can\ncombine several Linux commands into a command chain. For example, if your\nfile listing does not fit to one screen, you could redirect it to `less`\nso that you can browse it one screenful at a time.\nThis kind of redirecting could be done like this:\n\n```bash\nls -l | less\n```\n\nAs another example, we could use the `grep`\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
