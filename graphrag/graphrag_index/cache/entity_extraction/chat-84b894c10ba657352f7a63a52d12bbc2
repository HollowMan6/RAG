The terms of use are usually defined in a license, such as an open [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license. Data can be completely open for use or its use may be subject to certain restrictions, which are normally due to the sensitivity of information, business secrets, or agreements signed by researchers. As a general rule, you can use data in accordance with its terms of use.\n\nThe terms of use for a dataset are always determined by the person producing it or a person to whom the producer has transferred the rights to that dataset ([Copyright Act 404/1961](http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1961/en19610404.pdf)). If necessary, you can contact the owner of the data in order to clarify any uncertainty regarding its use.\n\n### How to license your own data?\n\nWhen making data available, it is recommended that licenses are used. This allows you to for example retain the copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make use of your data. [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) (CC BY) are widely used for licensing. Creative commons license spectrum between public domain (on top in the picture below) and all rights reserved (bottom).

It means that you give full rights to others for using the data. \n\n\n\n## Access restrictions\n\nPublishing your data doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that your datasets must be available to anyone and everyone. If you have concerns that releasing your data openly could cause harm to someone or something, or have other negative consequences, you can choose to apply specific restrictions on how people can gain access to your data. Usually, the options are to:\n\n1. **allow anyone** to download the files attached to your dataset (Open),\n1. allow anyone to download the files attached to your dataset **from a certain date onwards** (Embargo),\n1. allow anyone to **apply for access** to download the files attached to your dataset (Mediated), or\n1. **not allow** anyone to download the files attached to your dataset at all (Restricted). Â \n\nWhichever option is selected does not affect the visibility of the datasetâ€™s descriptive metadata, meaning that even if access to data is restricted, descriptive information about the published dataset is displayed in the publishing platform. Any restriction needs however to be specified and contact information made available and kept up to date.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
