Inspect the task list with `more`, `less` or `cat`. The file should look\n   like:\n\n   ```bash\n   g16 < /scratch/<project>/$USER/gaussian-hq/C7O2H10/dsC7O2H10nsd_0001.com >> output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0001.log\n   g16 < /scratch/<project>/$USER/gaussian-hq/C7O2H10/dsC7O2H10nsd_0002.com >> output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0002.log\n   g16 < /scratch/<project>/$USER/gaussian-hq/C7O2H10/dsC7O2H10nsd_0003.com >> output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0003.log\n   ...\n   ```\n\n4. Notice that the output will be directed into a directory called `output`.\n   Create this directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p output\n   ```\n\n### Run the HyperQueue task array with `sbatch-hq`\n\nðŸ’¬ Running a HyperQueue task array is similar to running a Slurm array job.\nHowever, HyperQueue packs the individual tasks within a single Slurm job step\nand is thus much more efficient, especially if there are a huge number of\ntasks. In this case, submitting the job is also very easy since we can use the\n`sbatch-hq` wrapper to avoid having to create a batch script by hand.\n\n1. Submit the list of Gaussian commands using `sbatch-hq`:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load sbatch-hq gaussian\n   sbatch-hq --cores=4 --nodes=1 --account=<project> --partition=small --time=00:15:00 commandlist\n   ```\n\nðŸ’¬ The `sbatch-hq` command creates and submits a batch script that starts the\nHyperQueue server and worker(s) and submits the task array with inputs read\nfrom the `commandlist` file. The following resources are requested:\n\n- One Puhti node, `--nodes=1`, i.e. 40 cores in total\n- 4 cores per command, `--cores=4`, matching the specification in each Gaussian\n  input file\n- Computing time for 15 minutes, `--time=00:15:00`\n- Billing project `--account <project>` (replace `<project>` accordingly)\n- The `small` partition\n\nðŸ’¬ Given that 40 cores are requested for running 200 tasks, each using 4 cores,\n10 tasks are able to run concurrently. The number of commands in the file can\n(usually should) be much larger than the number of commands that can fit\nrunning simultaneously on the reserved resources to avoid creating too short\nSlurm jobs.\n\n## Monitor the job\n\n1. You can monitor the Slurm queue with (replace `<slurmjobid>` with the\n   assigned Slurm job ID):\n\n   ```bash\n   squeue -j <slurmjobid>\n   # or\n   squeue --me\n   # or\n   squeue -u $USER\n   ```\n\n2. This does, however, not provide you information about the progress of the\n   individual sub-tasks. To monitor these, export the location of the\n   HyperQueue server and use the `hq` commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   export HQ_SERVER_DIR=$PWD/hq-server-<slurmjobid>   # replace <slurmjobid> with the actual id of your Slurm job\n   hq job info 1\n   ```\n\n3. Once the workflow has finished (should take a bit more than 10 minutes),\n   print a list of the `b3lyp/cc-pVDZ` energies for each of the 200 structures\n   sorted by energy (most stable structure first):\n\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"E(RB3LYP)\" output | sort -k6 -n -o energies.txt\n   ```\n\n4. Using `head energies.txt`, the output should look like:\n\n   ```bash\n   output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0015.log: SCF Done:  E(RB3LYP) =  -423.218630672     A.U. after   14 cycles\n   output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0192.log: SCF Done:  E(RB3LYP) =  -423.216601925     A.U. after   12 cycles\n   output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0193.log: SCF Done:  E(RB3LYP) =  -423.214963908     A.U. after   12 cycles\n   output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0028.log: SCF Done:  E(RB3LYP) =  -423.214781165     A.U. after   13 cycles\n   output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0037.log: SCF Done:  E(RB3LYP) =  -423.214421420     A.U. after   14 cycles\n   output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0026.log: SCF Done:  E(RB3LYP) =  -423.214326717     A.U. after   14 cycles\n   output/dsC7O2H10nsd_0008.log\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
