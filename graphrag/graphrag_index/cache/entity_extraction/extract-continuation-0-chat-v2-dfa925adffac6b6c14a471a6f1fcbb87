It is especially great for Python and bash scripts but can be used with any programming language. VS Code has a lot of extensions for your needs, some notable are the Python extension and the Jupyter notebook extension. \n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install VS Code to your computer [from the VS Code webpage](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the Remote SSH Plugin from the Extension tab on the program. \n\n![Remote SSH extension in Visual Studio Code](../../img/VSCode_remote_extension.png 'Remote SSH extension')\n\n!!! note\n        __Windows users__ also need an SSH client installed as PuTTy is not supported. \n\n        If you have access to admin privileges, you can [enable the OpenSSH on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). \n\n        If you don't have access to admin privileges, you can install [Git for Windows from here](https://gitforwindows.org/) and configure VS Code to use the SSH client included in Git (__File__ -> __Preferences__ -> __Settings__ -> search for __\"Remote SSH Path\"__ and add path to your ssh.exe e.g __C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USER>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\usr\\bin\\ssh.exe__). You might also need to disable the setting \"useLocalServer\" if you encounter problems with VS Code using your Windows username rather than CSC username.\n\n\n### Usage\n\nAfter installation go to the Remote Explorer tab in VS Code and add new remote machine from the __+__ symbol. When VS Code asks for the SSH command, type\n```\nssh <csc_username>@puhti.csc.fi\n```\nAlso you need to choose a config file where it will save that connection to.\n\n![Adding a SSH Remote connection](../../img/VSCode_add_connection.png 'Adding SSH connection')\n\nSee also the [Remember hosts and advanced settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_remember-hosts-and-advanced-settings) section of the VS Code documentation for further details.\n\nAfter that you can connect to the new host and it will ask you what operation system the target machine has (Puhti is Linux) and also your CSC password.\n\n![Connecting to a host in VSCode](../../img/VSCode_connect_to_host.png 'Connecting to host')\n\nYou are now in Puhti and can open a folder and edit files remotely. Notice that you can also transfer files to Puhti/Mahti by dragging and dropping them to VS Code.\n\nIf you prefer to use an ssh private key instead of your password, you can add `-i <path_to_your_keyfile>` to the command shown above. This is mandatory for LUMI, but for Puhti and Mahti you need to first add the corresponding public key to the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file on the remote system.\n\n### Configuring CSC software environments in VS Code Remote SSH\n\nDue to usage of the [module](../../computing/modules.md) system and singularity containers for loading software environments, the VS Code Remote SSH extension is sometimes unable to correctly detect installed software, especially in Python environments. This means that e.g. code completion hints and many other convenient features will not work. Some additional configuration is required in order for VS Code to enable these.\n\nThis typically requires running an SSH remote command upon connection and varies depending on your exact use case - details on the exact commands that need to be run are listed below for a few examples. However, in all cases you need to\n\n1. Enable remote commands in the Visual Studio Code Remote-SSH extension:\n   Open the settings screen (`Ctrl ,`) and type \"enable remote command\" in the search field. The `Enable Remote Command` setting should appear as the first search result. Make sure it is enabled (shows the tick mark). ![Enabling Remote Command in Remote SSH extension](../../img/VSCode_enable_remote_command.png).\n\n2. Configure a connection with remote command in your SSH configuration file:\n   Open the SSH configuration file (`Ctrl Shift p` or `F1`) and type `ssh configuration`, then `Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File` should appear as the first result. Click it.\n\n   In the now opened file, add a new block like the following and save the file:\n   ```\n   Host puhti-software-environment\n        HostName puhti.csc.fi\n        User <csc_username>\n        RemoteCommand <remote_command>\n   ```\n   Adjust the `HostName` to the system you want to connect to. You can freely choose the label after `Host` (`puhti-software-environment`) and this is how it will appear in the remote host selection of the VS Code Remote SSH extension when you make a connection. We recommend giving each combination of system and software environment you work with a recongnizable name (e.g., `puhti-pytorch`).\n\n   If you prefer to use an SSH key instead of being prompted for your password,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open source code editor made by Microsoft that supports remote development with the Remote SSH extension)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOTEPAD++<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A text editor that supports remote development through the NppFTP plugin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing environment where scripts can be developed remotely)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another computing environment where scripts can be developed remotely)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A virtual machine environment for developing scripts remotely)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>PUHTI<|>Visual Studio Code can be used to develop scripts remotely on Puhti<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>MAHTI<|>Visual Studio Code can be used to develop scripts remotely on Mahti<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>CPOUTA<|>Visual Studio Code can be used to develop scripts remotely on cPouta<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOTEPAD++<|>PUHTI<|>Notepad++ can be used to develop scripts remotely on Puhti<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOTEPAD++<|>MAHTI<|>Notepad++ can be used to develop scripts remotely on Mahti<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOTEPAD++<|>CPOUTA<|>Notepad++ can be used to develop scripts remotely on cPouta<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
