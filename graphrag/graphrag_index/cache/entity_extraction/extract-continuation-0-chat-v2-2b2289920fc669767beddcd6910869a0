However, you do not have access to the uploaded files until either you or the sender shares the bucket with your project:\n```text\nswift post <your_bucket_name> -r \"your_project:*\"\n```\n\nFor example:\n```text\nswift post my_fishbucket -r \"project_1234:*,project_4567:*\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the project public and then access the file.\n\n## Files larger than 5 GB\n\nSwift has a single-object size limit of 5 GiB. In order to upload files\nlarger than this, you must create a large object that consists of\nsmaller segments. To achieve this, you can use Swift to upload a\nso-called _Static Large Object_ (SLO).\n\nTry to upload a large file:\n```text\n$ md5sum /tmp/6GB.zero\n9e6a77a2d5650b2e2a710a08e9e61a81  /tmp/6GB.zero\n$ stat /tmp/6GB.zero\nFile: '/tmp/6GB.zero'\nSize: 6424625152      Blocks: 12548104   IO Block: 4096   regular file\n...\n$ swift upload my_bigfishes /tmp/6GB.zero\nObject PUT failed: https://a3s.fi:443/swift/v1/my_bigfishes/tmp/6GB.zero 400 Bad Request   EntityTooLarge\n```\n\nIt fails with the message `EntityTooLarge`, so instead:\n```text\n$ swift upload my_bigfishes --use-slo --segment-size 1G /tmp/6GB.zero\ntmp/6GB.zero segment 3\ntmp/6GB.zero segment 5\ntmp/6GB.zero segment 1\ntmp/6GB.zero segment 0\ntmp/6GB.zero segment 4\ntmp/6GB.zero segment 2\ntmp/6GB.zero\n```\n\nThis creates a new bucket:\n```text\n$ swift list |grep my_bigfishes\nmy_bigfishes\nmy_bigfishes_segments\n```\n\nIn this case the target bucket (my_bigfishes) contains just a front object that contains information what segments, stored in the segments bucket (my_bigfishes_segments) make the stored file. Operations performed to the front object are automatically reflected to the segments. Normally users don't need to operate with the segments buckets at all and objects inside these buckets should not be deleted or modified.\n\nDownload the entire 6GB.zero:\n\n```text\n$ swift download my_bigfishes tmp/6GB.zero -o /tmp/6GB.zero\ntmp/6GB.zero [auth 0.594s, headers 0.881s, total 74.467s, 86.969 MB/s]\n$ md5sum 6GB.zero\n9e6a77a2d5650b2e2a710a08e9e61a81  6GB.zero\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bucket in Swift for storing files with configurable access permissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project whose members can have read access to MY_FISHBUCKET)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project with specific member(s) having read access to MY_FISHBUCKET)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project with specific member(s) having write access to MY_FISHBUCKET)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project with a member having write access to MY_FISHBUCKET)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT6<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project whose members can have write access to MY_FISHBUCKET)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT_1234<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project whose members can have read access to MY_FISHBUCKET)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT_4567<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project whose members can have read access to MY_FISHBUCKET)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY_BIGFISHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bucket in Swift specifically for storing large files, utilizing Static Large Object (SLO) storage strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY_BIGFISHES_SEGMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bucket in Swift that stores segments of large files uploaded to MY_BIGFISHES)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT1<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>Members of PROJECT1 can have read access to MY_FISHBUCKET<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT2<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>Specific member(s) of PROJECT2 have read access to MY_FISHBUCKET<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT3<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>Specific member(s) of PROJECT3 have write access to MY_FISHBUCKET<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT5<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>A member of PROJECT5 has write access to MY_FISHBUCKET<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT6<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>Members of PROJECT6 can have write access to MY_FISHBUCKET<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_1234<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>Members of PROJECT_1234 can have read access to MY_FISHBUCKET<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_4567<|>MY_FISHBUCKET<|>Members of PROJECT_4567 can have read access to MY_FISHBUCKET<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY_BIGFISHES<|>MY_BIGFISHES_SEGMENTS<|>MY_BIGFISHES uses MY_BIGFISHES_SEGMENTS to store segments of large files<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
