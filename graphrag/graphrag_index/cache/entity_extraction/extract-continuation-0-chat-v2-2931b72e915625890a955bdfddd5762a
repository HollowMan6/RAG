To run multi-node subjobs you need to modify the submission script generated by the GUI\n    by specifying a separate driver HOST (e.g. `-DRIVERHOST interactive -SUBHOST parallel`, see also\n    [below](#advanced-host-selection)).\n\nThe following figures show the time to solution and scaling of the [PSIWAT\nbenchmark](https://github.com/QEF/benchmarks/tree/master/PSIWAT) (2552 electrons,\n4 k-points, Maestro 2021.3, pure MPI).\n\n![QE scaling](../../img/qe-scaling.svg)\n\n* Scaling is almost ideal up to 4 nodes when using `-npools 4 -ntg 4` .\n* For this system and QE binary the performance does not scale beyond 320 cores.\n* Always confirm the appropriate scaling of your system before running large multi-node jobs\n  (minimum 1.5 times speedup when doubling the number of cores).\n\n## Additional flags for Maestro modules\n\nDifferent modules have different options. You can set some of them in\nthe GUI, but you may find more options with the `-h` flag, e.g.\n\n```bash\nglide -h\n```\n\nwhere `glide` would be the Maestro module you want to run, like\n`qsite`, `pipeline`, `bmin`, `ligprep`, etc.\n\n[The Maestro documentation](https://www.schrodinger.com/documentation) has a nice summary\nof the different options for different modules. In the documentation, go to\n\"Getting started\" > \"Running Schrödinger Jobs\" > \"Running Distributed Schrödinger Jobs\".\n\n### Simple HOST selection\n\nFor jobs that finish within about two days and run 10 subjobs, just use:\n\n```bash\n-HOST normal_72h:10\n```\n\nor if they all finish within 14 days, use:\n\n```bash\n-HOST longrun:10\n```\n\nIf you have a workflow that will last longer, read on.\n\n### Advanced HOST selection\n\nThe general aim is to have the \"driver process\" running on a \"HOST\"\nthat will be alive for the whole duration of the workflow. Good\noptions are _interactive_ and _longrun_ if you estimate the complete\nworkflow to take more than 3 days (queuing included). A \"driver process\"\nthat is not using a lot of CPU is also allowed on a login node, but\na subjob is not. Never submit jobs on Puhti _login nodes_ with\n`-HOST localhost`. It's ok if you create your own batch script or\n[interactive session](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) _and_ use\nlocalhost on a compute node, but that's for special cases only and not\ndiscussed on this page.\n\nSet the \"driver\" or \"master\" to run on a HOST that allows for long\nrun times (if it's a big calculation). The driver needs to be alive\nfor the whole duration of the workflow, otherwise your subjob\nlikely ends up fizzled. You can use \"interactive\" which allows\nfor 7 days for one core, or \"longrun\" which allows for 14 days.\nIf you need to run multiple workflows at the same time, choose\n\"longrun\" for the next drivers. In both cases select some \"normal\"\nHOST (i.e. \"small\" Slurm partition) for the (sub)jobs. Suitable\nsplitting will reduce your queuing time. Asking for the longrun HOST\n\"just in case\" is not forbidden, but may lead to unnecessary queuing.\n\nYou may be able to set the number of subjobs already in the GUI.\nTypically, it would set the \"number of processors\", which in many drivers\nwill be equal to the number of subjobs. Alternatively, you may be able\nto set also the number of subjobs. This enables you to limit the number\nof simultaneous jobs with the \"processor count\" (so that you and others\nwon't run out of licenses) but keep a single subjob at a suitable size.\nPlease have a look at the help text of your driver via the Help path\ndescribed above.\n\nIn summary, for a large workflow, edit the GUI-generated script along the\nlines: `-HOST \"normal_72h:10\"` to `-HOST \"longrun:1 normal_72h:9\"` or e.g.\n`-HOST \"normal_72h\"` to `-HOST \"interactive:1 normal_72h:9\"`. Another\nalternative is to use explicit flags, `-DRIVERHOST interactive -SUBHOST normal_72h`.\n\nNote that you can only have two jobs running in the interactive HOST at the same time.\n\nDesmond jobs can have the `-HOST gpu` flag as set by the GUI, but Windows users\nneed to change the forward slash \"/\" to backward slash \"\\\" in the binary name.\n\n### Authoritative job control instructions from the manual\n\nA more detailed discussion on advanced jobs can be found in the Maestro documentation\nvia the GUI or the [Schrödinger website](https://www.schrodinger.com/documentation):\n\n* \"Getting Started\" > \"Running Schrödinger Jobs\" > \"Running Schrödinger Applications from the Command Line\" >\n  \"The HOST, DRIVERHOST, and SUBHOST Options\"\n\nand a table of driver process conventions from:\n\n* \"Getting started\" > \"Running Schrödinger Jobs\" > \"Running Distributed Schrödinger Jobs\"\n\n## Setting number of subjobs or molecules per subjob\n\n!!! info \"Tip\"\n    If you don't know how\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment where multi-node subjobs and core jobs are managed, requiring specific partition and host selection for job submission)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSIWAT BENCHMARK<|>EVENT<|>A benchmark test involving 2552 electrons and 4 k-points, using Maestro 2021.3 and pure MPI, to measure the performance and scaling of computational tasks on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maestro is a software module used in computational tasks, offering various options for running jobs, including different flags for performance optimization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHRÖDINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Schrödinger provides documentation and software for running distributed jobs, including Maestro modules and job control instructions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PSIWAT BENCHMARK<|>PUHTI<|>The PSIWAT benchmark is used to measure the performance and scaling of computational tasks specifically on the Puhti computing environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTRO<|>SCHRÖDINGER<|>Maestro is a module or software that is documented and possibly developed by Schrödinger, as indicated by the provision of documentation and running instructions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTRO<|>PUHTI<|>Maestro modules are used for running computational jobs on Puhti, indicating that Puhti supports or is compatible with Maestro software<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
