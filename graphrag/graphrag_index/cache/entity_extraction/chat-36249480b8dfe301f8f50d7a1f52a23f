You may\nuse these as templates for your own project batch scripts.\n\n!!! info \"About memory specification\"\n\n    - The LUMI-C compute nodes have 256GB of memory installed but 224GB is really \n      available to the job. The exception is the 512 GB and 1TB nodes located in\n      the `small` partition.\n    - If you submit to the `standard` partition, were the node are in exclusive\n      mode we recommend to use the `--mem=0` option, i.e., all  the memory on \n      the node.\n    - If you use the small partition, we recommend you to use `--mem-per-cpu=1750`\n      or a lower value. If you request more than 2GB/core then you will be \n      billed for the memory according to the [billing policy][billing].\n\n\n## Shared memory jobs\n\nBelow is an example job script for a single node run of an OpenMP application \nrequesting 128 cores on a compute node of the LUMI-C `small` partition.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=examplejob   # Job name\n#SBATCH --output=examplejob.o%j # Name of stdout output file\n#SBATCH --error=examplejob.e%j  # Name of stderr error file\n#SBATCH --partition=small       # Partition (queue) name\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1              # One task (process)\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=128     # Number of cores (threads)\n#SBATCH --time=12:00:00         # Run time (hh:mm:ss)\n#SBATCH --account=project_<id>  # Project for billing\n\n# Any other commands must follow the #SBATCH directives\n\n# Set the number of threads based on --cpus-per-task\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n \n./your_application\n```\n\n### MPI-based jobs\n\n!!! Failure \"Fortran MPI program fails to start\"\n    If a Fortran-based program with MPI fails to start when utilizing a large\n    number of nodes (512 nodes for instance), add\n    `export PMI_NO_PREINITIALIZE=y` to your batch script before running `srun`.  \n\nBelow is an example job script for a 2 nodes run of an MPI application running \n128 ranks per node, i.e., 256 ranks in total.
