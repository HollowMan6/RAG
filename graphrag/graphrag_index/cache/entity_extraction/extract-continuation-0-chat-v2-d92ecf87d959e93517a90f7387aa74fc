Please consult the [Python packages installation guide][python-install] for an overview of recommended ways to manage pip installations on LUMI. Alternatively, the container images provided by [AMD on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocm) may be used on LUMI.\n\n## Running PyTorch within containers\n\nWe recommend using container images from [`rocm/pytorch`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch) or [`rocm/deepspeed`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/deepspeed).\n\nThe images can be pulled with Singularity:\n\n```bash\n$ SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$SCRATCH/tmp-singularity singularity pull docker://rocm/pytorch:rocm5.4.1_ubuntu20.04_py3.7_pytorch_1.12.1\n```\n\nThis will create an image file named `pytorch_rocm5.4.1_ubuntu20.04_py3.7_pytorch_1.12.1.sif` in the directory where the command was run. After the image has been pulled, the directory `$SCRATCH/tmp-singularity singularity` can be removed.\n\nPlease consult the [Singularity containers page][containers] for more details about using Singularity/Apptainer containers on LUMI.\n\n### Installing other packages along the container's PyTorch installation\n\nOften we may need to install other packages to be used along PyTorch.\nThat can be done by creating a virtual environment within the container in a host directory.\nThis can be done by running the container interactively and creating a virtual environment in your `$HOME`.\nAs an example, let's do that to install the package `python-hostlist`:\n\n```bash\n$ singularity exec -B $SCRATCH:$SCRATCH pytorch_rocm5.4.1_ubuntu20.04_py3.7_pytorch_1.12.1.sif bash\nSingularity> python -m venv pt_rocm5.4.1_env --system-site-packages\nSingularity> . pt_rocm5.4.1_env/bin/activate\n(pt_rocm5.4.1_env) Singularity> pip install python-hostlist\n```\n\nWhen running the container, the virtual environment must be activated before calling python.\n\n## Multi-GPU training\n\nThe communication between LUMI's GPUs during training with Pytorch is done via [RCCL](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl),\nwhich is a library of collective communication routines for AMD GPUs.\nRCCL works out of the box on LUMI, but a special plugin is required to take advantage of the [Slingshot 11 interconnect][interconnect].\nThat's the [`aws-ofi-rccl`](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/aws-ofi-rccl) plugin,\nwhich is a library that can be used as a back-end for RCCL to interact with the interconnect via `libfabric`.\n\nThe `aws-ofi-rccl` plugin can be installed by the user with EasyBuild:\n```bash\n$ module load LUMI/22.08 partition/G\n$ module load EasyBuild-user\n$ eb aws-ofi-rccl-66b3b31-cpeGNU-22.08.eb -r\n```\nOnce installed, loading the module `aws-ofi-rccl` will add the path to the library to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so RCCL can detect it.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's now consider an example to test the steps above.\nWe will use the script [cnn_distr.py](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/lumi-reframe-tests/blob/main/checks/apps/deeplearning/pytorch/src/cnn_distr.py) \nwhich uses the [pt_distr_env.py](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/lumi-reframe-tests/blob/main/checks/apps/deeplearning/pytorch/src/pt_distr_env.py) module \nto setup PyTorch's distributed environment.\n\nThat module is based on `python-hostlist`, which we installed earlier.\n\nThe Slurm submission script can be something like this:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=pt-cnn\n#SBATCH --ntasks=32\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8\n#SBATCH --time=0:10:0\n#SBATCH --exclusive\n#SBATCH --partition=standard-g\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8\n\nmodule load LUMI/22.08
