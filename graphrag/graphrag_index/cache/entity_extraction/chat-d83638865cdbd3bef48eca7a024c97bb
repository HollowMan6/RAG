See [examples for using GRASS GIS commands in Puhti with GRASS bash scripting, Python scripting or PyGRASS](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/grass). See also the references section at the end of this page.\n\n### GRASS GIS Graphical User Interface\n\n#### GRASS in Puhti\n\nThe easiest option for using GRASS GIS is to open it in Puhti web interface.\n\n1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi). \n2. Open [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). \n3. After launching the Desktop, double-click GRASS-GIS icon for the newest version.\n \nIf you want to use older version, open `Terminal` (Desktop icon) and start GRASS GIS:\n\n```\nmodule load qgis/3.22\ngrass\n```\n\n#### GRASS in LUMI\n\nUntil LUMI web interface is available, GRASS needs to be used with\n[SSH X11 forwarding](../computing/connecting/index.md#graphical-connection).\n\n```\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule load qgis\ngrass\n```\n\n## License \n\nGeographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) is Copyright, 1999-2020 GRASS Development Team, and licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
