This is a quite common issue with\n   self-installed software. To fix the situation, add the `lib` path to the\n   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/projappl/<project>/$USER/hello-cmake/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n5. Retry running the program, it should now work!\n\n## Bonus: Create your own module for the program\n\nðŸ’¡ Users can create their own modules for self-installed applications. See the\n[\"Module system\" section](../../part-1/modules/index.md) for more details about\nthe CSC module system.\n\nðŸ’¬ CSC uses the [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module system\nin which the Lua language is used to write modulefiles.\n\n1. Create a directory for your own modulefiles:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /projappl/<project>/$USER/my-modules  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   cd /projappl/<project>/$USER/my-modules        # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n2. In this directory, create a directory for the \"Hello World\" program and move\n   there:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p hello-cmake\n   cd hello-cmake\n   ```\n\n3. Let's assume this is version 0.0.1 of the \"Hello World\" program. Create a\n   file `0.0.1.lua` and paste the contents below to it (using e.g. `nano`).\n   Remember to change `<project>` and `<user>` to match your CSC project and\n   username:\n\n   ```lua\n   -- This is an example modulefile for hello-cmake module\n   -- Edit <project> and <user> below as needed to match the installation root directory\n   local root = '/projappl/<project>/<user>/hello-cmake'\n   local version = '0.0.1'\n\n   load('boost/1.79.0')\n   prepend_path('PATH', pathJoin(root, 'bin'))\n   prepend_path('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', pathJoin(root, 'lib'))\n\n   if (mode() == 'load') then\n      LmodMessage('Hello World version', version, 'loaded.')\n   end\n   ```\n\n4. The example highlights a few Lmod/Lua features:\n   - Comments are specified with `--`.\n   - `local` is used to declare local variables, in this case for the version\n     number and installation path.\n   - `load()` is used to load modules the program depends on.\n   - `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are modified using `prepend_path()`, and\n     `pathJoin()` function is used together with `root` variable to compose the\n     full paths to the `bin` and `lib` directories.\n   - A message is printed to the standard output when the module is loaded\n     using an `if` clause and `LmodMessage`.\n5. To make your own modules available you need to modify your `MODULEPATH`\n   variable. This can be done by hand or using `module use <path>` command, and\n   is required each time you start a new shell session:\n\n   ```bash\n   module use /projappl/<project>/$USER/my-modules                     # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   # or\n   export MODULEPATH=/projappl/<project>/$USER/my-modules:$MODULEPATH  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n6. Now that the module system knows where to search for your own modules, you\n   can check if the module you created is available:\n\n   ```bash\n   module avail hello-cmake\n   ```\n\n7. Load the module and check if you can run `hi` command:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load hello-cmake/0.0.1\n   hi\n   ```\n\n## More information\n\n- Not all software use CMake build system.
