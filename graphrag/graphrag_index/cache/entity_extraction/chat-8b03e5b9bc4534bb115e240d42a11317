How to speed up jobs\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 1\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/throughput/scaling.html\n---\n\n# Performing a simple scaling test\n\n> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that\n\n- you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/)\n- your account belongs to a project that has\n  [access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\n## Overview\n\n💬 Before running large jobs using a lot of computing resources (cores), it is\nimportant to verify that the calculation actually can utilize the requested\nresources efficiently.\n\n💡 In this tutorial, you will perform a very simple scalability test, i.e.\nrunning a parallel program with a varying number of cores and observing how it\nspeeds up.\n\n## Download a sample parallel program\n\n1. Create and enter a suitable scratch directory on Puhti (replace `<project>`\n   with your CSC project, e.g. `project_2001234`):\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER/scalability-test\n   cd /scratch/<project>/$USER/scalability-test\n   ```\n\n2. Download a toy program that performs a simple molecular dynamics simulation\n   in parallel using OpenMP threading. Understanding the details of the code is\n   not important for the completion of this tutorial.\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/md\n   ```\n\n3. Edit the access permissions of the file to allow execution:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x md\n   ```\n\n## Create a parallel batch job script\n\n💬 We will run the MD program multiple times using six different thread counts;\n1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32.\n\n1. Copy the following script into a file `job.sh` using, e.g., `nano`:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   #SBATCH --partition=test\n   #SBATCH --account=<project>   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   #SBATCH --nodes=1\n   #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=<N>   # Replace <N> with appropriate number of threads\n   #SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n\n   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}\n   srun md --particles=500 --steps=5000\n   ```\n\n2. Replace `--cpus-per-task=<N>` in the script with `--cpus-per-task=1` in\n   order to run the program using one thread per task.\n3. Submit the script with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sbatch job.sh\n   ```\n\n4. After a few moments, an output file `slurm-<jobid>.out` will appear in the\n   current directory. View its contents once the job has finished (takes less\n   than a minute):\n\n   ```bash\n   cat slurm-<jobid>.out   # Replace <jobid> with the actual Slurm job id\n   ```\n\n5. Repeat the above steps for the thread counts 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 by editing\n   `--cpus-per-task` in the `job.sh` script and then resubmitting the job. If\n   you have limited time, you may also just download a set of pre-calculated\n   results:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/scaling-test.tar\n   tar -xvf scaling-test.tar\n   ```\n\n6. Check the elapsed time of each simulation once they have completed:\n\n   ```bash\n   grep \"Elapsed time\" *.out | sort -n\n   ```\n\n💭 Did the computation become faster? If so, is the scaling ideal, i.e. does\ndoubling the thread count also make it run twice as fast? If not, can you think\nof any reasons that might limit the scalability? How many threads does it make\nsense to run the program with?\n\n☝🏻 To ensure efficient use of resources, a good rule of thumb is that when\nyou double the number of used cores the job should become *at least* 1.5 times\nfaster. If this is not the case, request fewer cores.\n\n💡 Bonus! Increase the problem size by increasing `--particles=<value>`. Is the\nprogram now able to scale to a larger number of threads? Why does\n`--steps=<value>` not have the same effect?\n\n## More information\n\n💡 Docs CSC: [Performance checklist](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/performance-checklist/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
