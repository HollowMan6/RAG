above command displays all `scratch` and `projappl` directories you have access to.\n\nFor example, if you are a member in two projects, with unix groups `project_2012345`\nand `project_3587167`, then you have access to two `scratch` and `projappl` directories:\n\n```text\n[kkayttaj@puhti ~]$ csc-workspaces \nDisk area               Capacity(used/max)  Files(used/max)  Project description

/scratch/project_2012345\n```\n\nPlease note that not all CSC projects have Puhti/Mahti access, so you may not\nnecessarily find a `scratch` or `projappl` directory for all your CSC projects.\n\n!!! Note\n    The `scratch` and `projappl` directories are shared by all the members of the\n    project. All new files and directories are also fully accessible for other\n    group members (including read, write and execution permissions).\n\nIf you want to restrict access from your group members, you can reset the permissions\nwith the `chmod` command. Setting read-only permissions for your group members for\nthe directory `my_directory`:\n\n```bash\nchmod -R g-w my_directory\n```\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the `scratch` directory is only intended for processing data.\nAny data that should be preserved for a longer time should be copied to the *Allas*\nobject storage server. Instructions for backing up files from CSC supercomputers to\nAllas can be found in the [Allas guide](../data/Allas/index.md).\n\n## Moving data between supercomputers\n\nData can be moved between supercomputers via Allas by first uploading the data in\none supercomputer and then downloading in another supercomputer. This is the\nrecommended approach if the data should also be preserved for a longer time.\n\nData can also be moved directly between the supercomputers with the `rsync` command.\nFor example, in order to copy `my_results` (which can be either file or directory)\nfrom Puhti to the directory `/scratch/project_2002291` in Mahti, one can issue in\nPuhti the command:\n\n```bash\nrsync -azP my_results yourcscusername@mahti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_2002291\n```\n\nSee [Using rsync](../data/moving/rsync.md) for more detailed instructions for `rsync`.\n\n## Increasing quotas\n\nYou can use the **MyCSC portal** to [manage quotas of the `scratch` and `projappl`\ndirectories](../accounts/how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md).\n\nRemember that even after the quota is increased, the planned automatic cleaning process\nwill continue removing idle files from the `scratch` directory. Data that is not under\nactive computing should be stored in the Allas storage service.\n\nRemember also that you can increase these values only to some extent. Especially regarding\nthe number of files, you should reconsider your data workflow if it requires that tens\nof millions of files are stored in the `scratch` area.\n\n!!! info\n    To find out how much data/files you have on the disk, please use our [LUE\n    tool](../support/tutorials/lue.md) which is much more performant than standard\n    tools such as `stat` or `du`.\n\n## Temporary local disk areas\n\nIf the application depends on the use of temporary files, the suitability of\nthe filesystem may have a large effect on the performance of the application,\nsee section *Mind your I/O - it can make a big difference* in the [Performance\nchecklist](running/performance-checklist.md#mind-your-io---it-can-make-a-big-difference).\nPlease note that some applications use temporary files \"behind the scenes\". Usually these\napplications read some environment variable that points to a suitable disk area, such as\n`$TMPDIR`.\n\nSome nodes have local disks that can be used to speed up your work when the temporary files\nare only needed within a single login- or compute node.\n\n### Login nodes\n\nEach of the login nodes have 2900 GiB of fast local storage. The storage is located under\n`$TMPDIR` and is separate for each login node.  \n\nThe local storage is good for compiling applications and performing pre- and post-processing\nthat require heavy I/O operations, for example packing and unpacking archive files.\n\n!!! Note\n    The local storage is meant for **temporary** storage and is cleaned frequently.\n    Remember to move your data to a shared disk area after completing your task.\n\n### Compute nodes with local SSD (NVMe) disks\n\nJobs running in the I/O- and GPU-nodes in Puhti and GPU-nodes in Mahti have local fast storage\navailable.
