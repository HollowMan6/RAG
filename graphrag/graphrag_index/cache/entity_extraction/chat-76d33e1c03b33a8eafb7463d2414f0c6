To\n        convert your key, go to the **Conversions :octicons-arrow-right-16:\n        Export OpenSSH key** menu in the key generator tool and save it in the\n        OpenSSH format.\n\n        You can convert between these two key formats at any time using the key\n        generator tool. Load a key by using the **Conversions :octicons-arrow-right-16:\n        Import key** menu, then save it in the desired format: \n        \n          - OpenSSH to PPK: load a OpenSSH key, then save it with the **Save\n            private key** button\n          - PPK to OpenSSH: load a PPK key, then save it via the **Conversions\n            :octicons-arrow-right-16: Export OpenSSH key** menu\n\n!!! warning\n    The private key should never be shared with anyone, not even\n    with LUMI staff. It should also be stored only on your local computer\n    (public key can be safely stored in cloud services). Protect it with a good\n    password! Otherwise, anyone with access to the file system can steal your\n    SSH key.\n\n## Register your public key\n\n=== \"For regular users (with a non-Finnish allocation)\"\n\n    Now that you have generated your key pair, you need to register your **public** key\n    in your [:material-account: **MyAccessID user profile**][myaccessid-profile]. From there, the public key will be \n    copied to LUMI.\n\n    To register your key, click on the *Settings* item of the menu on the left\n    as shown in the figure below. Then select *SSH keys* and click the *New key* button. Now copy and paste the content of your **public** key file in the text area and click the *Add SSH key* button.\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"../../assets/images/MyAccessID_ssh-key.png\" width=\"480\" alt=\"Screenshot of user profile settings to setup ssh public key\">\n      <figcaption>MyAccessID Own profile information to add ssh public key.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n=== \"With a Finnish allocation\"\n\n    Now that you have generated your key pair, you need to register your\n    **public** key in your MyCSC [:material-account: **user profile**][mycsc-profile].\n\n    To register your key with [MyCSC][mycsc-profile], click on the *Profile* item of the menu on the left side of the screen. If your browser window is narrow, the navigation might be hidden, in which case you need to open it from the top-right button. In the lower right corner of the *Profile* page there is a box which reads *SSH PUBLIC KEYS*. Click the *Add key* button (you may need to re-login). Paste the content of your **public** key in the text area which reads *Key*. Omit the ending of the key file that has your local username and the name of your computer. It should look like\n\n    ```bash\n    ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI....I3J\n    ```\n\n    Add a title, e.g., *lumi*, and then click *Add*. \n\n\nAfter registering your SSH key, there can be a couple of hours delay until it\nis synchronized to LUMI and your account is created. **You will receive your\nusername via email once your account has been created**.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
