More details about\ndifferent components can be found in the [Intel documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/trace-analyzer-collector/user-guide-reference/2021-10/introduction.html).\n\nTrace Collector allows also [tracing of user defined events](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/trace-analyzer-collector/user-guide-reference/2021-10/tracing-user-defined-events.html). However, this always requires recompilation of the \napplication. As tracing can generate very large files even for relatively small applications,\nit is often useful to [filter the collected data](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/trace-analyzer-collector/user-guide-reference/2021-10/filtering-trace-data.html).\n\nThe collected data are saved in a series of `<executable>.stf` files in the running directory. \n\n### Known issues\n\n- In Fortran programs, MPI tracing works only with `mpi` module (i.e. not with `use mpi_f08`)\n- Collector exits with error `Failed writing buffer to flush file \"/tmp/xxx.dat\": No space left on device`.\n- As the `/tmp/` in compute nodes is small, temporary files might need to be stored in the running \n  directory by setting `export VT_FLUSH_PREFIX=$PWD`\n\n## Analyzing the traces\n\nIn order to improve the performance of the graphical user interface, \nwe recommend using the [Puhti web interface remote desktop](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md) when carrying out the analysis. \nThe analyzer is started on the host terminal with the command (note that the `intel-oneapi-itac` module needs to be loaded):\n\n```bash\ntraceanalyzer <executable>.stf\n```\n\nThe Trace Analyzer can show the timeline of each process and map each MPI\ncall between the tasks. For each performance issue, the following information\nis provided: description, affected processes, and source locations.\n\nIntel Trace Analyzer can be used also for investigating OTF2 formatted traces \nproduced by other performance tools, such as [ScoreP/Scalasca](scalasca.md). \nThis can be achieved by starting the analyzer:\n\n```bash\ntraceanalyzer\n```\n\nand selecting then the OTF2 file via the \"Open\" dialog.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Intel documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/trace-analyzer-documentation.html)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
