OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics ([by OpenCFD Ltd](https://www.openfoam.com/)).\n\nThere are three different variants of OpenFOAM, of which at CSC - IT Center for Science computer platforms, are currently installed different versions from [OpenFOAM Foundation](https://cfd.direct/) and [OpenCFD Ltd](https://www.openfoam.com).\n\n## License\n\nOpenFOAM is freely available and open source, and is licensed under the [GNU General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (Gnu GPL or GPL), with GPL license typical [characteristics for exploitation](https://openfoam.org/licence/). OpenFOAMÂ® is registered trademark of OpenCFD Ltd, licensed to the OpenFOAM Foundation.\n\n## Available\n\nDifferent versions of OpenFOAM, provided by OpenFOAM Foundation and OpenCFD, are installed on [Puhti, Mahti and LUMI servers](../computing/available-systems.md).\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter logging in to the server, give the command\n\n```bash\nmodule spider openfoam\n```\n\nOn LUMI, you need to first load the module environment\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule spider openfoam\n```\n\nThe command lists available OpenFOAM versions on the server. To get more information about a specific version, for example, about OpenFOAM Foundation's version 10, use the command\n\n```bash\nmodule spider openfoam/10\n```\n\nTo launch a specific version (say, version 10), give the command\n\n```bash\nmodule load openfoam/10\n```\n\nOpenCFD's versions are recognized by a version string starting with letter _v_, i.e., to launch version openfoam/v2206, give the command\n\n```bash\nmodule load openfoam/v2206\n```\n\nExample files for a batch job script are available on the servers. After giving the launch command (`module load`, see above), the example script is the file\n\n```bash\n$WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR/batch_script_examples/parjob_openfoam_<server>\n```\n\nwhere `<server>` is either `puhti`, `mahti` or `lumi`. Copy that into your working directory for further modifications.\n\n### Use collated parallel I/O method on CSC's servers\n\n- on CSC's computing servers, use OpenFOAM's [collated I/O method](https://openfoam.org/news/parallel-io/) whenever possible\n- using the collated method is absolutely necessary when the model size is large and a lot of disk I/O is necessary\n\nThe file system used on CSC's computing platforms, Puhti, Mahti and LUMI, is [Lustre](http://lustre.org/), which is optimized for reading and writing small number of files. The number of output files written by OpenFOAM can easily become very large, even up to millions, if the mesh size is large, and if field variables are written to the disk every time step. Such I/O operations will cause the file system to become heavily overloaded, and the whole computing platform can get jammed even by a few simultaneous OpenFOAM users.\n\nThe above described traditional parallel I/O method of OpenFOAM can be replaced in the latest versions of OpenFOAM with the collated parallel I/O method, where the output data is written only in few files. Considering HPC platforms using parallel files systems, this has been a significant improvement to OpenFOAM.\n\nIn test runs on CSC's servers with the collated I/O method, significant difference in throughput time has not been recognized compared to non-collated method. In some tests, collated method has shown to be slightly faster. Our recommendation is to use collated method whenever it is practicable.\n\n#### An example\n\nMahti server contains 128 cores per node. If the total subdomain number in the model is 256, a user may allocate two full nodes for the solver run. Decomposition batch job can then be done using the command\n\n```bash\ndecomposePar -fileHandler collated -ioRanks '(0 128 256)'\n```\n\nand two directories `processors256_0-127` and `processors256_128-255` are created. For the solver run, the command will then be\n\n```bash\npimpleFoam -parallel -fileHandler collated -ioRanks '(0 128 256)'\n```\n\nIn that way, 128 processes are launched on both nodes, and on each node one process is a master process. Reconstruction of the data is done in the batch job with the command\n\n```bash\nreconstructPar\n```\n\nIn this example, the pressure results of domains 0 to 127 per time step are written into a single file. In a non-collated method, the same results would have been written into 128 separate files. This tremendous decrease in the number of output files happens naturally with all the rest of the field variables also.\n\nI/O operations in the collated method are based on threaded sub-processes, and therefore do not cause any time overhead for the simulation compared to non-collated method.\n\n#### Example batch job scripts for collated method usage on Mahti\n\nThe example scripts for separate batch runs\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
