It implements three algorithms, BWA-MEM (`mem`), BWA-Backtrack (`aln`) and BWA-SW (`bwasw`). BWA-Backtrack works for query sequences shorter than 200bp. The other two algorithms are used longer reads up to around 100kbp. BWA-MEM is recommended for reads longer than 70gb. All algorithms do gapped alignment.\n\nBWA can be used to align both single-end and paired-end reads to a reference genome or sequence set.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 0.7.17\n- [Chipster](https://chipster.csc.fi) graphical user interface\n\n## Usage\n\nOn Puhti, BWA can be taken in use as part of the `biokit` module collection:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nThe biokit modules set up a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools, including BWA. Note however that there are other bioinformatics tools on Puhti that have separate setup commands.\n\nThe basic syntax of BWA commands is:\n\n```bash\nbwa <command> [options]\n```\n\n### BWA indexes\n\nCSC does not maintain pre-compiled BWA indexes for reference genomes on Puhti, but you can check if genomes used in Chipster can provide you a ready-made index for a genome you want use. This can be done with the command:\n\n```\nchipster_genomes bwa\n``` \n\nIf a suitable genome index is not found, the fist step in creating alignment with BWA is downloading the reference genome and indexing it. Please note that your `$HOME` directory is often too small for working with complete genomes. Instead, you should do the analysis in the scratch directory of your Puhti project.\n\nYou can use for example command `ensemblfetch` or `wget` to download a reference genome to Puhti. For example:\n\n```bash\nensemblfetch homo_sapiens\n```\n\nThe command above retrieves the human genome sequence to a file called `Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa`. You can calculate the BWA indexes for this file with the command:\n\n```bash\nbwa index -a bwtsw Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa\n```\n\nNote that for small less than 2 GB reference genomes you could use a faster \"is\" indexing algorithm (`bwa index -a is`)\n\n### Single-end alignment\n\nOnce the indexing is ready you can carry out the alignment for singe-end reads with the command:\n\n```bash\nbwa mem Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa reads.fastq > aln.sam\n```\n\nIf you wish to use the `aln` (BWA-Backtrack) algorithm, you need to do the alignment in two steps.\n\nFirst calculate the actual alignment:\n\n```bash\nbwa aln Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa reads.fastq > aln_sa.sai\n```\n\nThe result file is in BWA-specific `.sai` format that you can convert to SAM format with `bwa samse` command:\n\n```bash\nbwa samse Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa aln_sa.sai reads.fastq > aln.sam\n```\n\n### Paired-end alignment\n\nIf you use the MEM algorithm, you can do the paired-end alignment with just one command:\n\n```bash\nbwa mem Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa read1.fq read2.fq > aln.sam\n```\n\nIn the case of BWA-Backtrack algorithm, you should first do a separate alignment run for each read file:\n\n```bash\nbwa aln Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa reads1.fq > aln1.sai\nbwa aln Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa reads2.fq > aln2.sai\n```\n\nThe two `.sai` alignment files are combined with command `bwa sampe`:\n\n```bash\nbwa sampe Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa aln1.sai aln2.sai reads1.fq reads2.fq > aln.sam\n```\n\n### Running BWA batch jobs on Puhti\n\nIn Puhti, BWA jobs should be run as batch jobs. Below is a sample batch job file for running a BWA job on Puhti:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=bwa\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=12:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --mem=32000\n#SBATCH --account=your_project_name\n\n#load the bio tools\nmodule load biokit\n\n# Index the reference genome\nbwa index -a bwtsw Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa\n\n# Run the alignnments\nbwa mem -t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa reads1.fq reads2.fq > aln.sam\n```\n\nIn the batch job example above, one BWA task (`--ntasks=1`) is executed.
