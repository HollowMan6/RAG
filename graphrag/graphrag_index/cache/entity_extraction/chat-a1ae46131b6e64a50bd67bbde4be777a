With Horovod you should\nuse MPI for launching jobs.  Horovod can be used both with single- and\nmulti-node jobs.\n\nIn CSC's supercomputers Horovod is supported only for some specific\nversions of [TensorFlow](../../apps/tensorflow.md) and\n[PyTorch](../../apps/pytorch.md).  Please check the application pages\nfor further information. To take Horovod into use, just load the\nappropriate module, and modify your program according to the\ninstructions in [Horovod's\ndocumentation](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/), for example:\n\n* [Horovod with PyTorch](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytorch.html)\n* [Horovod with TensorFlow](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tensorflow.html) and [Keras](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/keras.html)\n\n\n### TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.Strategy`\n\nTensorFlow also has its own [built-in mechanisms for distributed\ntraining](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training) in\nthe [`tf.distribute.Strategy`\nAPI](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/Strategy).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
