Multinode R examples using raster data can also be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/puhti).\n\nOne topic of note is that setting up multiprocess and/or multithread jobs on multiple nodes (so-called hybrid jobs) is a special case of its own. Even if you have successfully set up a parallel R job on a single node, it will be necessary to rethink your setup when scaling up to several nodes. Tips on how to approach this can be found in the [`r-env` documentation](../../apps/r-env.md#openmp-mpi-hybrid-jobs) and as part of [CSC's general documentation on hybrid batch jobs](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-mahti.md#hybrid-batch-jobs).\n\n## Some practical tips\n\n**1. Think about your parallelisation strategy.** The way in which your analysis can be parallelised will depend on the analysis you intend to run. Some key questions include:\n\n- Do the R packages you're using support parallelisation?\n- Are the parallel tasks fully independent (or do they need to communicate with one another)?\n- Is a single node sufficient or are several needed?\n\nMultinode analyses will give you access to more resources than a single-node analysis, but it is important to weigh this against the costs (overhead and longer queue times) of running a multinode analysis. If you can run it on a single node, this is always best.\n\n**2. Start with a minimal proof of concept.** Begin with a single node to make sure that your parallelisation strategy is working. Use a small set of test data first and compare the execution time of your parallel analysis with that of a serial (non-parallel) analysis, for example using the R package `tictoc`. Once your parallel analysis works on a single node, troubleshooting multinode setups becomes much easier.\n\n**3. Become close friends with batch job files and your R packages.** To help with this, consult existing tutorials and R package documentation. Useful CSC Docs pages include examples of [serial and parallel R batch jobs](../../apps/r-env.md#serial-batch-jobs), our [basic batch job documentation](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md) and details on [available batch job partitions](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md). The `r-env` user documentation provides many examples of parallel R jobs and how to launch them on Puhti.\n\n**4. Reserving more resources does not necessarily mean faster analyses.** Finding an optimal number of cores and/or threads is usually a case of trial and error. Often there is a threshold after which only marginal benefits are obtained in relation to the resources you reserve. Also, the more resources one reserves, the longer the wait until they become available.\n\n**5. Make use of `parallelly::availableCores()`**. There are a couple of ways to detect the number of available cores using R. On Puhti, using `parallel::detectCores()` will always give 40 as the result. That is, the function detects how many cores are present on the node, regardless of how many you have reserved. Much more often, the goal is to detect the number of reserved cores. To do this, one can use the package `parallelly` (or the package `future` that imports `parallelly`):\n\n```r\nparallelly::availableCores()\n```\n**6. Remember that parallelisation support is limited in RStudio**. Forked processes are considered unstable when running R from RStudio. Because of this, certain options for parallelisation (e.g. `plan(multicore)` in the package `future`) are unavailable when using RStudio. If you wish to use multiprocessing while working with RStudio, socket clusters are a more stable option. However, heavier parallel scripts are best submitted as non-interactive batch jobs.\n\n## Briefly about standards\n\nWhen reading about parallel R and parallel batch jobs, you are likely to come across two terms: OpenMP and Message Passing Interface (MPI). Both are widely used standards for writing software with support for parallelism. As an R user these details might be useful to remember:\n\n- Multiprocess and multithread R jobs often rely on OpenMP\n- Multinode R jobs rely on MPI\n- So-called \"hybrid jobs\" are called that because they use both OpenMP and MPI\n\n## Further resources\n\nIf you would like to dive beyond the `r-env` user documentation, the following links contain further information that may be of interest: \n\n- [Lecture slides on `r-env`](https://csc-training.github.io/puhti-r-workshop/slides/html/05_r-env.html#/r-env-singularity-on-puhti)\n    - In particular, see: [R jobs come in many guises (and from there onward)](https://csc-training.github.io/puhti-r-workshop/slides/html/05_r-env.html#/r-jobs-come-in-many-guises)\n- [Teaching materials for Using CSC HPC Environment Efficiently](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/)\n- [CRAN Task View on high-performance computing](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
