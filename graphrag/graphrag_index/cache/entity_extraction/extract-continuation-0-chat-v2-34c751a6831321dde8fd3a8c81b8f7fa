Please schedule this into your regular maintenance.\n\nIf your use case does not support automatic updates, which is common for highly available setups, please make sure to schedule regular maintenance windows where the software upgrade is scheduled.\n\n* **Subscribe to security announcements for your OS**, if there is a security problem in your operating system, you need to find it out as soon as possible. You can subscribe to an appropriate mailing list, RSS feed, ... to keep an eye out for anything that requires urgent action.\n\n### Be mindful about the user accounts in the VM\n\nKeep an eye on the user accounts enabled in your system. Some applications create default accounts which are unnecessary or even directly insecure. An ideal scenario might be three accounts:\n\n* `root` with ssh disabled and no password. This is the default in [Pouta VM images](images.md).\n* A user account for a sysadmin that can only be accessed via ssh keys and has sudo access. Pouta VM images provide this user preconfigured as well, the name of the user depends on the distribution (`cloud-user`, `centos` or `ubuntu`), see the documentation above for more reference.\n* and add user-level accounts that run a single service and have no login possible, neither remote nor local access. \n\nDo not enable password login, **use SSH keys** instead. Passwords can be, with enough time and compute power, guessed with brute force. The average SSH server deals with thousands of such attacks every week. When using SSH keys, challenge-response authentication is used instead. This means that for each login a different challenge is asked and a different response is the correct one. No secret (password or key) ever travels across the network \n\nPassword protect your SSH keys and make sure your key never leaves the hardware where it was created.\n\n* Do not store public keys (much less private) on the image used to create the VM. Pouta clouds provide a metadata service so that you can download public keys on boot. This is recommended as it ensures that if your key is compromised, access from that key can be removed from all running instances and no new one will ever have this public key.\n\n### Keep logs of your applications\n\nUse the best practices for logging:\n\n- Make sure that the services are logging to a secure location, that is as tamper-proof as possible.\n- Keep the logs for a reasonably long amount of time.\n- Consider logging to a remote server as well.\n\n*Reused with kind permission from <a\nhref=\"https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions\"\nclass=\"external-link\">NeCTAR</a>.*\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Virtual machines require rebooting for kernel upgrades and should have scheduled maintenance for regular software upgrades)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pouta VM IMAGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta VM images have specific user account configurations, including a root account with ssh disabled, a sysadmin user account accessible only via ssh keys, and user-level accounts with no login capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH KEYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH keys are recommended over password login for their security benefits, including challenge-response authentication and the ability to password protect the SSH keys themselves)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METADATA SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta clouds offer a metadata service to download public keys on boot, enhancing security by allowing compromised keys to be removed from all running instances)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINES<|>Pouta VM IMAGES<|>Pouta VM images are used to configure virtual machines, including security and user account settings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH KEYS<|>VIRTUAL MACHINES<|>SSH keys are used as a secure method of logging into virtual machines, replacing password logins<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>METADATA SERVICE<|>SSH KEYS<|>The metadata service provided by Pouta clouds is used to manage SSH keys for virtual machines<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
