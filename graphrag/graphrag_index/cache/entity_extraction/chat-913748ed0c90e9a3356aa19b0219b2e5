It is an **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) tool, so it allows us to version control an application and follow its evolution along time, make identical copies (prod, preprod, dev, ...) and predictable upgrades, and of course share and publish the application. It is one of the main tools used upstream, if a tool has a \"Kubernetes deployment\" it is most likely going to be using Helm.\n\n## Introduction\n\nHelm packages applications into Charts. A Helm chart is a collection of `YAML` templates. In order to create a chart, one must first [install the Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) command line tool and install the [oc command line](../rahti2/usage/cli.md) tool. Once done, to continue:\n\nMake sure you are logged in:\n\n```sh\noc whoami\n```\n\nthis should return your Rahti 2 username. Then create an example chart:\n\n```sh\n$ helm create example\nCreating example\n```\n\nthe result will be:\n\n```sh\n$ find example\nexample\nexample/Chart.yaml\nexample/templates\nexample/templates/tests\nexample/templates/tests/test-connection.yaml\nexample/templates/deployment.yaml\nexample/templates/service.yaml\nexample/templates/ingress.yaml\nexample/templates/hpa.yaml\nexample/templates/serviceaccount.yaml\nexample/templates/_helpers.tpl\nexample/templates/NOTES.txt\nexample/values.yaml\nexample/charts\nexample/.helmignore\n```\n\nIt creates a mostly self-explanatory skeleton of a Chart. The structure is:\n\n* The `Chart.yaml` file contains basic description values: `name`, `description`, `version`, ...\n* The `values.yaml` file contains default values for the Chart and shows which parameters can be configured.\n* The `.helmignore` contains the patterns to ignore, it is similar to `gitignore`. WE will not change this file.\n* The `charts` folder contains the other charts that this one depends on. We will not use this feature.\n* Finally the `templates` folder contains the different API Kubernetes objects to be deployed. The [templates engine syntax](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/) allows for a great deal of configurability. It supports [Built-in Objects](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/) that for example show the current cluster capabilities, it supports external [values files](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) where each deployment of the application can have its own separate value file, it has an extensive list of [template functions](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/), [flow control](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/), and more.\n\n## Package a deployed application\n\nBefore we can start the process, we need to \"clean up\" the current Helm example chart.\n\n1. Delete (or move anywhere else) all files inside the `templates` folder.\n\n1. Empty the `values.yaml` file.\n\n1. Edit `Chart.yaml` and fill up the values as needed.\n\n!!! info \"helm lint\"\n\n    The helm tool provides a `lint` command that will report any syntaxt issue with the current template.\n    ```sh\n    $ helm lint example\n    ==> Linting example\n    [INFO] Chart.yaml: icon is recommended\n\n    1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed\n    ```\n\nNow we can create the `YAML` files that contain the different parts of the application. As an example we will use a simple webserver with a volume attached to it. We will use an iterative process to create a copy of our current deployment. It is iterative because we will first create a simple, not configurable, and probably not working version, test it, come back and make it more complete and configurable, test it again, and so on.\n\n1. List all the API Objects to get an idea of the different parts that it consists of:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ oc get dc,deployment,pvc,secret,configmaps,service,route -o name\n\tdeployment.apps/nginx\n\tpersistentvolumeclaim/html\n\tsecret/builder-dockercfg-h4cwh\n\tsecret/builder-token-6fngh\n\tsecret/builder-token-n2rdm\n\tsecret/default-dockercfg-dqfxm\n\tsecret/default-token-kfjlb\n\tsecret/default-token-znxls\n\tsecret/deployer-dockercfg-rpsxj\n\tsecret/deployer-token-gnvzt\n\tsecret/deployer-token-pvws5\n\tservice/glusterfs-dynamic-ed156002-8a7e-11ed-b60d-fa163e0d8841\n\tservice/nginx\n\troute.route.openshift.io/nginx\n\t```\n\n1. From the list above, we are only interested in `deployment.apps`, `persistentvolumeclaim/html`, `service/nginx` and `route.route.openshift.io/nginx`. The rest are auto-generated like the `secret/` tokens or created by other objects like the `service/glusterfs-dynamic-ed156002-8a7e-11ed-b60d-fa163e0d8841` object was created as a result of the creation of the `persistentvolumeclaim/` (PVC) creation.\n\nWe will write templates one by one, starting with the Volume. There are two simple approaches to accomplish this task, \"get and clean\" or \"recreate from template\". We will first try the \"get and clean\" method.\n\n### Get and clean\n\nThe idea of get and clean is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
