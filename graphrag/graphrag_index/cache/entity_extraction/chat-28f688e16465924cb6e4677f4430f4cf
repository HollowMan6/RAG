On\nthe Allas side, you need at least read access to the data. You either need to\nbe a member of a project which has Allas service in use, or the data in\nquestion needs to be available for downloading in Allas. Note that the projects\nin Allas, Puhti and IDA do not need to be the same.\n\nIn short, there are four steps to follow:\n\n1. Download the data from Allas to Puhti scratch disk\n2. Rearrange the data on the scratch disk\n3. Upload the data to IDA\n4. Clean the Puhti scratch disk\n\n!!! Note\n    Data in IDA is required to be described as research datasets with Fairdata\n    services.\n    [See more information here](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/about-fairdata/benefits/).\n\n### Step 1. Download the data from Allas to Puhti scratch\n\nScratch disk area in Puhti is recommended as it is by default much larger than\nother areas, e.g. user's home folder. Also, you can request even larger scratch\nquota if the default is not enough. On Puhti, you can show the available disk\nareas and their usage with command:\n\n```bash\ncsc-workspaces\n```\n\nFor more details about Puhti disk areas, see\n[Supercomputer disk areas](../../computing/disk.md).\n\nFor example, create a new directory `copydir` for the data under the scratch\narea of `project_2000013` (replace this with your own project ID):\n\n```bash\nmkdir /scratch/project_2000013/copydir\n```\n\nDownload the data from Allas to that new directory. You should use the same\nprotocol as was used to originally upload the data to Allas. If the data was\nuploaded with command-line tools, preferably also use the same command-line\ntool. More information about the Allas tools on Puhti is available at\n[Accessing Allas in the CSC computing environment and other Linux platforms](../Allas/accessing_allas.md#accessing-allas-in-the-csc-computing-environment-and-other-linux-platforms).\n\nIn our example case the data was originally uploaded to Allas with a-commands,\nso the user uses `a-get` to download the data:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf\ncd /scratch/project_2000013/copydir\na-get 2000013-wrk-bucket/working_data.tar.zst\n```\n\n`a-get` command downloads the data and extracts it into the `copydir`\ndirectory.\n\n### Step 2. Rearrange the data on scratch\n\nThis is an important step when copying data from Allas to IDA. You should only\ncopy data that is important enough to be described as a dataset in Fairdata\nservices. Also, it makes the rest of the procedure easier to think at this\npoint what kind of a directory structure would be good for the datasets and\narrange the data in the Puhti directory to follow that structure. Note that in\nIDA you can't freeze (turn stable research data to an immutable state) more\nthan 5000 files at once. So, as a rule of thumb, you should have at most that\namount of files in one directory.\n\nIn case you will include some files in more than one dataset, do not make\nduplicate files – IDA files may belong to multiple datasets.\n\nIn our example case, the project decides that it makes sense to have two\ndistinct datasets, so the data is rearranged into two directories,\n`experiment_a` and `survey_2021`.\n\n### Step 3. Upload the data to IDA\n\nYou should only copy data that is important enough to be described as datasets\nin Fairdata services. Also, you should have the data already rearranged into a\ndirectory structure that would be good for the datasets.\n\nYou can upload the data using the IDA command-line tool, which uses the syntax:\n\n```bash\nida upload <target_in_ida> <local_file>\n```\n\nContinuing our example, uploading both directories (`experiment_a` and\n`survey_2021`) to IDA project 2000002:\n\n```bash\nmodule load ida\ncd /scratch/project_2000013/copydir\nida upload -p 2000002 experiment_a experiment_a\nida upload -p 2000002 survey_2021 survey_2021\n```\n\nMore examples can be found in the\n[GitHub repository of the IDA command-line tool](https://github.com/CSCfi/ida2-command-line-tools#examples).\n\nIf the user has already configured the IDA command-line tool, then the upload\ncommand uses that configuration. If not, then the upload command asks the user\nfor their username and password in IDA.\n[See detailed instructions here](../ida/using_ida.md#configuring-and-using-ida-in-csc-supercomputers).\n\n### Step 4. Clean the Puhti scratch\n\nIf you do not need to continue working with the data on Puhti after uploading\nit to IDA, remove it from the scratch disk area of Puhti to free up disk space.\n\n## Copying data from IDA to Allas via Puhti\n\nIn order to copy data from IDA to Allas with this procedure, you need to be a\nmember of a project that has Allas and Puhti services in use.
