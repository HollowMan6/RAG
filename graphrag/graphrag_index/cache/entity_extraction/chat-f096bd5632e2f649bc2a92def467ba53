Actually, the\ntemplate field is exactly the pod described in `pod.yaml`, except the fields\n`apiVersion` and `kind` are missing.\n\n*`ReplicationController.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ReplicationController\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp\n  name: blogtest-replicator\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    app: serveapp\n    pool: servepod\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      name: mypod\n      labels:\n        app: serveapp\n        pool: servepod\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: serve-cont\n        image: \"image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/httpd\"\n```\n\nThe ReplicationControllers are functionally close to ReplicaSets, discussed\nin the chapter \"[Kubernetes and OpenShift\nconcepts](../rahti2/concepts.md)\".\nA ReplicationController can be transformed into a ReplicaSet by\nchanging `spec.selector` to `spec.selector.matchLabels` and setting\n`kind: ReplicaSet`.\n\n!!! info\n\n    A central Kubernetes' concept coined *reconciliation loop* manifests in the\n    ReplicationControllers. The reconciliation loop is a mechanism that measures\n    the *actual state* of the system, constructs the *current state* based to the\n    measurement of the system and performs such actions that the state of the\n    system would equal to the *desired state*.\n\n    In such a terminology, ReplicationControllers are objects that describe the\n    *desired state* of the cluster. Another such object is the service\n    object encountered earlier. There, an another reconciliation loop compares\n    the endpoints of the service to the actual pods that are ready and adjusts\n    accordingly. As a result, the endpoints of the service always point to pods\n    that are ready and only those pods whose labels contain all fields in\n    the selector of the service object. In fact, every incidence of `spec` in\n    a YAML representation of a Kubernetes object describes a specification for\n    a reconciliation loop. The loops for pods just happen to be tied to the\n    worker nodes of Kubernetes and are thus susceptible to deletion if, or\n    when, the worker nodes are deprovisioned.\n\n## Cleaning up\n\nOnce we are satisfied with the application, let us not keep it running in the\ncluster but remove it with the command `oc delete`:\n\n```bash\noc delete all --selector app=serveapp\n```\n\nThis will delete all objects with the label `app: serveapp`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, a static web page server was set up using YAML files\nrepresenting the Kubernetes objects. The created objects can be further\nmodified in the OpenShift web console where:\n\n* Routes can be modified to be secure ones encrypted by TLS.\n* Autoscalers, persistent storage, resource limits and health checks can be added to ReplicationControllers.\n* New routes can be added to services.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
