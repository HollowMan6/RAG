First, a 30-day test period for the\nlarge partition is requested. Second, during the test period, the scalability\nand parallel performance of the code is demonstrated with appropriate test\nruns. Finally, the results are submitted for evaluation by the project manager.\n\nThe process is described in detail below.\n\n## Test access to the large partition on Mahti\n\nTo request the 30-day test period, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) and in the _Projects_ menu select the\n   project you want to modify.\n2. In the _Services_ list, click open the settings for **Mahti** service\n   (_Configure_). This opens a page where the project manager can modify the\n   settings for disk quotas (_Quota settings_) and request access to the large\n   partition (_Large partition settings_). Click open\n   _Large partition settings_.\n3. Click the _Apply for trial access_ button. After the access has been\n   granted, you will be able to submit jobs to the large partition.\n\n## Scalability testing\n\nIn the second phase, test runs demonstrating the scalability are to be\nperformed. Here are some general guidelines for scalability testing.\n\n* Testing should be done for at least three different node counts up to the\n  target in production (for example with 20, 40, 60, and 80 nodes).\n* Tests are run through the batch job system.\n* The test runs should reflect real production runs, i.e. the number of atoms,\n  number of grid points, disk I/O load etc. should be similar.\n* The input data set must be the same for each run.\n* The running time in tests should be reduced as much possible, for example, by\n  running only few time steps, iterations etc.\n* The running time should still be long enough that initialization does not\n  affect results. Typically, a few minutes for the shortest run time (largest\n  node count) is fine.\n* Parameters affecting the scalability can, and are encouraged to be, changed.\n  Note also the\n  [performance checklist](../computing/running/performance-checklist.md).\n* Minimum requirement is 75 % parallel efficiency (i.e. speedup of 1.5 when\n  doubling the number of nodes).\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe scalability report should contain a short description of the software and\nthe test case, as well as wall-times for each node count. If the software is\nnot pre-installed by CSC, describe briefly also the parallelization strategy\nused in the software and include details about the I/O implementation and load.\n\nAttach to the report a representative batch job script, and if the application\nwas run with hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization, attach also the `stderr` of a\nsingle run where the following settings are applied:\n\n```bash\nexport OMP_AFFINITY_FORMAT=\"Process %P level %L thread %0.3n affinity %A\"\nexport OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=true\n```\n\nReporting the results of the test runs or applicable previous scalability data\nis done through [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi) as follows:\n\n1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) and in the _Projects_ menu select the\n   project you want to modify.\n2. In the _Services_ list, click open the settings for **Mahti** service\n   (_Configure_). This opens a page where the project manager can modify the\n   settings for disk quotas (_Quota settings_) and request access to the large\n   partition (_Large partition settings_). Click open\n   _Large partition settings_.\n3. For the results and justification, there is a text box and possibility to\n   attach documents (please remember to upload the documents after you have\n   selected them). Multiple documents can be attached. Finally, submit the\n   justification.\n4. CSC experts will evaluate the results and grant production access to the\n   large partition. If there is a problem with the code performance, the\n   project manager will be contacted.\n\n## Assistance\n\nCSC's experts can help users in performing scalability tests if needed and also\nprovide hints for improving the performance of their software.\n[Contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md) if you need assistance with\nyour software.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
