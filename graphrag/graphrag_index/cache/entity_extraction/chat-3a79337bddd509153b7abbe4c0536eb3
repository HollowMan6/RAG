That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor \nof all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 2.1.2 \n\n## Usage\n\nKraken in included in the `biokit` module. To set it up, run the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nThis loads the Kraken2 package which can be started with the command `kraken2`. For example:\n\n```bash\nkraken2 --help\n```\n\nThere are several Kraken2 reference databases available on Puhti. By default, Kraken2 uses the\n`standard` database that is based on taxonomic information and complete genomes in RefSeq \nfor the bacterial, archaeal, and viral domains, along with the human genome and a \ncollection of known vectors (UniVec_Core).\n\nAvailable databases in Puhti are:\n\n|Name  | Mem. request | Description    | \n|------|--------------|-----------------|\n|standard| 40 GB | NCBI taxonomic information, as well as the complete genomes in RefSeq for the bacterial, archaeal, and viral domains, along with the human genome and a collection of known vectors (UniVec_Core).|\n|krak_microb| 44 GB | RefSeq bacterial, archea, viral, fungi and protozoa |\n|16S_Greengenes_k2db|  1 GB | Greengenes 16S data |\n|16S_RDP_k2db | 1 GB | RDP 16S data |\n|16S_SILVA132_k2db| 1 GB |Silva 132 16S data |\n|16S_SILVA138_k2db| 1 GB |Silva 138 16S data |\n|minikraken_8GB_20200312| 1 GB  |            |\n\nUsing Kraken2 with a large reference database will require plenty on memory. For example, jobs with the standard Kraken2 database require 40 GB of memory. Thus, Kraken should in practice always be executed as a batch job. Below is a sample Kraken job using 4 cores 40 GB of memory and 6 hours of runtime:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=kraken2\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=06:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --account=project_123456\n#SBATCH --mem=40000\n\nmodule load biokit\nkraken2 -db standard --threads $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK input.fasta --output results.txt\n```\n\nYou can submit the batch job file to the batch job system with the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file.bash\n```\n\nSee the [Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md) for more information about running batch jobs.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Kraken home page](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
