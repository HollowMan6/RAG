Using the storage requires an account, a CSC project, a Rahti 2 Project, and at least a Pod. In Rahti 2 a project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations.\n\nOne of the pillars of Docker is the immutability of images, once they are built, docker images never change. The issue for most of the applications is that it is necessary to store, update and later retrieve application data. In docker, this is solved by the concept of volumes, an external filesystem (to docker) that is mounted in the internal filesystem of a container. In Kubernetes, and by extension OpenShift, this problem can be solved in several ways.\n\n![Storage options](../../img/storage-options.drawio.svg)\n\n## Persistent storage\n\nThe solution more similar to Docker volumes is a [Persistent volume](persistent.md). This is a volume located in an external storage, that is mounted directly into the filesystem of the container like an additional hard disk would. This is the best solution for a seamless storage solution. You can also unmount it from the Pods it is attached to and attach it to another set of Pods. Moreover, persistent volumes represent a reliable storage option as the data in them is replicated.\n\nYou can find additional information on the [Persistent volume](persistent.md) page.\n\n## Ephemeral storage\n\nOther solution is to use ephemeral storage, called in Kubernetes an _Empty dir_. This is only meant for storing intermediate or temporal data, that needs fast read write access by the applications running inside the containers. The same _Empty dir_ can be mounted in every container inside a Pod. The data in the ephemeral storage is lost when the Pod is deleted. Given that the data in the ephemeral you should not store any persistent data there, and the ephemeral storage should not be considered reliable.\n\nYou can find additional information on the [Ephemeral storage](ephemeral.md) page.\n\n## Object storage\n\nIn case you need to store large volumes of data, or you need that your data can be easily accessed over the Internet, e.g., using URLs, object storage is the storage solution you are looking for. By using object storage, you are free to create and delete your Pods as the object storage is not tied to any Pod. Moreover, your data is replicated, thus object storage represents a reliable long-term storage option.\n\nAt CSC, we offer Allas as our object storage solution. You can find additional information on the [Allas page](../../../data/Allas/index.md).\n\nYou can find additional examples on how to backup to Allas [here](objectstorage.md).\n\n## Volume snapshots\n\nA snapshot represents the state of the storage volume within a cluster at a specific point in time. Volume snapshots can be used to provision a new volume and help protect against data loss in OKD. Rahti2 support Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots by default and the default volume snapshot class name is standard-csi.\n\nWith CSI volume snapshots, an app developer can:\n\n- Use volume snapshots as building blocks for developing application-level or cluster-level storage backup solutions.\n- Rapidly rollback to a previous development version during development.\n- Use storage more efficiently by avoiding the need to create a full copy each time.\n\nYou can find additional information on the [Volume snapshot](volume-snapshot.md) page.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides the Rahti 2 environment, offering various storage options and solutions including Persistent storage, Ephemeral storage, Object storage, and Volume snapshots)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 2 is a project environment within CSC that utilizes Kubernetes namespaces with additional annotations for project management and storage solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, involved in the storage solutions of Rahti 2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers, noted for the immutability of its images)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A family of containerization software developed by Red Hat, mentioned in the context of solving storage problems in Kubernetes environments like Rahti 2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC's object storage solution, offering large volume data storage and easy access over the Internet)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>CSC<|>Rahti 2 is an environment provided by CSC for project management and storage solutions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>KUBERNETES<|>Rahti 2 utilizes Kubernetes for its project management and storage solutions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER<|>RAHTI 2<|>Rahti 2 addresses the immutability of Docker images through its storage solutions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>KUBERNETES<|>OpenShift, mentioned in the context of Rahti 2, extends Kubernetes' capabilities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>CSC<|>Allas is offered by CSC as an object storage solution within the Rahti 2 environment<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
