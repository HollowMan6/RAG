Using this\napproach normally requires installing some extra software to your local\ncomputer, but it also makes the usage very fluent as no `scp` or other data\ntransfer programs are needed to move files between your local machine and CSC.\n\nOn macOS and Linux machines, `sshfs` can be used to mount certain disk areas at\nCSC to a user's own machine. With this tool the remote disk areas at the\nservers of CSC can be used just like local directories. To use `sshfs`, your\nlocal Linux machine must have [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) and\n[`sshfs`](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) installed. In the case of macOS,\nthe required packages are [macFUSE and SSHFS](https://osxfuse.github.io/).\n\n## Using sshfs in Linux\n\nOnce `sshfs` is installed on your Linux machine, you can create a remote disk\nmount with command syntax:\n\n```bash\nsshfs username@hostname:/path/to/dir /path/to/mountpoint\n```\n\nFor example, to make the home directory of user _kayttaja_ on Puhti visible to\na local Linux computer, one would execute the following commands on the local\nmachine:\n\n```bash\nmkdir csc_home\nsshfs kayttaja@puhti.csc.fi:/users/kayttaja csc_home\n```\n\n!!! Note\n    On macOS you might need to add the `-o defer_permissions` option to the\n    `sshfs` command in case you are getting `Permission denied` errors after\n    mounting.\n\nThe first command creates an empty directory that will be used as the mount\npoint in the second command. When the remote mount is established, you can use\nthe directory as any directory on your Linux system. For example, to list the\ncontents of the CSC home directory of _kayttaja_, one could just type the\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nls csc_home\n```\n\nIf no path is specified, the default mounted remote directory is the user's\nhome directory.\n\nTo unmount the file system, give the command:\n\n```bash\nfusermount -u mountpoint\n```\n\nFor our example, the command would be:\n\n```bash\nfusermount -u csc_home\n```\n\nOn macOS, replace the `fusermount -u` command with `umount`.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides directories and server services that can be accessed remotely, resembling the usage of an external disk or USB memory stick)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSHFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSHFS is a software tool used to mount disk areas at CSC to a user's own machine, making remote directories act like local ones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FUSE is a software required for using SSHFS on Linux machines, allowing for the mounting of remote disk areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACFUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>macFUSE is a version of FUSE required for macOS users to utilize SSHFS for mounting remote disk areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of the servers provided by CSC for remote disk mounts using SSHFS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSHFS<|>CSC<|>SSHFS is used to mount disk areas at CSC servers to local machines<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUSE<|>SSHFS<|>FUSE is required to install SSHFS on Linux machines<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACFUSE<|>SSHFS<|>macFUSE is the macOS equivalent required for SSHFS usage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a server at CSC that can be accessed remotely using SSHFS<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
