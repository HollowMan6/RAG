In Puhti the working copies of reference genome indexes, as well as any large files, should be stored to the /scatch directory.\n\nFor ease of use, set an environment variable to point to your /scratch directory. (Substitute correct path for the one used in example).\n```bash\nexport SCRATCH=/scratch/project_12345/$USER\n```\n\nCreate a directory for the reference genome index:\n```bash\nmkdir $SCRATCH/star-genome\n```\n\nAfter that, the indexing can be done with command:\n```bash\nSTAR --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir $SCRATCH/star-genome --genomeFastaFiles /path/to/genome/genome.fasta --runThreadN 2\n```\n\nOnce the indexing is done, the actual mapping task can be launched. STAR will generate the mapping output using fixed file names. Because of that it is recommended that each STAR job is run in a new, empty directory. In Puhti you should create this new job directory to /scratch directory of your project. New directory called _starjob1_ can be created with command:\n```bash\nmkdir $SCRATCH/starjob1\n```\n\nafter that the actual mapping job can be launched with commands:\n```bash\ncd $SCRATCH/starjob1\nSTAR --genomeDir $SCRATCH/star-genomes --readFilesIn my_reads.fastq\n```\n\nThe default parameters STAR uses are typical for mapping 2x76 or 2x101 Illumina reads to the human genome.\n\nIn Puhti, all computing tasks should be executed as batch jobs. In batch jobs you can also utilize thread based parallelization. Below is a sample batch job file for STAR. The job uses six computing cores from a single computing node. The memory reservation is 24 GB. Note that you must change the `--account` setting to match you poject.\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=STAR\n#SBATCH --output=STAR.stdout\n#SBATCH --error=STAR.stderr\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6\n#SBATCH --account=project_1234567\n#SBATCH --mem=24000\n\nexport SCRATCH=/scratch/project_12345/$USER\n\n# calculate indexes. You don't need to recalculte the indexes if they already exist.\nmkdir $SCRATCH/star-genome\nSTAR --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir $SCRATSCH/star-genome --genomeFastaFiles /path/to/genome/genome.fasta --runThreadN $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n\n# Run the mapping task\nSTAR --genomeDir $SCRATCH/star-genome --readFilesIn my-reads.fastq --runThreadN $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n```\n\nThe batch job script is launced with command sbatch. For example:\n```bash\nsbatch starjob1.sh\n```\n\n\n## More information\n\n*   [STAR user manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf)\n*   [STAR home page](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
