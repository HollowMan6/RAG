It enables the collection of a timeline of CUDA-related\nactivities on both CPU and GPU, including kernel execution, memory transfers,\nmemory set and CUDA API calls and events or metrics for CUDA kernels. The tool is very useful in identifying the high-level bottlenecks, hotspots and for determining which kernels should be targeted for optimization and analysis with the [Nsight Compute](ncu.md) tool.\nProfiling results are displayed in the console after the profiling data is\ncollected, and may also be saved for later viewing by *nsys-ui* tool.\n\nTo use `nsys`, one needs to first load the CUDA module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load cuda\n```\n\nTo profile a CUDA code, one then adds the command `nsys` before the normal\ncommand to execute the code. Running is otherwise similar to that of any other\nCUDA job on [Puhti](running/example-job-scripts-puhti.md#single-gpu) or [Mahti](running/example-job-scripts-mahti.md#1-2-gpu-job-ie-gpusmall-partition).\n\nAn example of usage and output of `nsys`:\n```bash\n$ nsys profile -t nvtx,cuda -o <results_file> --stats=true --force-overwrite true ./a.out\nCollecting data...\nProcessing events...\nCapturing symbol files...\nSaving temporary \"/tmp/cristian/6584503/nsys-report-b4eb-c068-9292-3b17.qdstrm\" file to disk...\nCreating final output files...\n\nProcessing [==============================================================100%]\nSaved report file to \"/tmp/cristian/6584503/nsys-report-b4eb-c068-9292-3b17.qdrep\"\n\nExporting 4657 events:\n\nGenerating CUDA API Statistics...\n\nCUDA API Statistics (nanoseconds)\nTime(%)      Total Time       Calls         Average         Minimum         Maximum  Name\n-------  --------------  ----------  --------------  --------------  --------------  -------------------------------------------------------------\n   85.3       323223522           4      80805880.5          128957       322811927  cudaMalloc\n   13.6        51524634           1      51524634.0        51524634        51524634  cudaDeviceReset\n   ....\n\nGenerating CUDA Kernel Statistics...\nCUDA Kernel Statistics (nanoseconds)\nTime(%)      Total Time   Instances         Average         Minimum         Maximum  Name\n-------  --------------  ----------  --------------  --------------  --------------  -------------------------------------------------------------\n  100.0           22912           1         22912.0           22912           22912  multiply_add_kn(float*, float const*, float const*, float const*, int)\n\nGenerating CUDA Memory Operation Statistics...\nCUDA Memory Operation Statistics (nanoseconds)\nTime(%)      Total Time  Operations         Average         Minimum         Maximum  Name\n-------  --------------  ----------  --------------  --------------  --------------  -------------------------------------------------------------\n   79.0         2022300           3        674100.0          663903          692095  [CUDA memcpy HtoD]\n   21.0          536223           1        536223.0          536223          536223  [CUDA memcpy DtoH]\n\nCUDA Memory Operation Statistics (KiB)\n              Total      Operations              Average            Minimum              Maximum  Name\n-------------------  --------------  -------------------  -----------------  -------------------  ------------------------------------------------\n           3906.250               1             3906.250           3906.250             3906.250  [CUDA memcpy DtoH]\n          11718.750               3             3906.250           3906.250             3906.250  [CUDA memcpy HtoD]\n\nGenerating Operating System Runtime API Statistics...\nOperating System Runtime API Statistics (nanoseconds)\nTime(%)      Total Time       Calls         Average         Minimum         Maximum  Name\n-------  --------------  ----------  --------------  --------------  --------------  -------------------------------------------------------------\n   67.0       343435124          29      11842590.5           23172       100249843  poll\n   22.6       115645051        1102        104941.1            1286        25309244  ioctl\n   5.5        28249766           4       7062441.5            3763        15288473   fread\n   ....\n```\n\n`nsys` supports many useful running options.
