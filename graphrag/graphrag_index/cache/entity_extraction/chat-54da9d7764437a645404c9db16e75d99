Batch job resource usage\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 1\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/batch_resources/tutorial_sacct_and_seff.html\n---\n\n# Using `sacct` and `seff` to understand resource usage of finished jobs\n\nüí¨ In this tutorial we look at the `seff` and `sacct` commands. The tutorial should be done on Puhti.\n\nüí≠ `seff` shows detailed data on used resources in an easy-to-read format, but can only show one job at a time.\n\nüí≠ `sacct` is useful when you want to look at a listing of jobs, but by default it only shows minimal data.\n\n## Get details about batch jobs\n\n1. Try `sacct` which by default shows the jobs you have run on the current date (_i.e._ since last midnight):\n\n```bash\nsacct\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Try specifying the start time of the listing using the `-S` option. Don't query too long time intervals, since this causes significant load on the system (max. queryable interval is three months).\n\n```bash\nsacct -S YYYY-MM-DD    # replace YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Look for a specific job ‚Äì _i.e._ specify the job ID using the `-j` option (if you can't think of one, you can use `21320280`):\n\n```bash\nsacct -j <slurmjobid>    # replace <slurmjobid> with a valid job ID \n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. To print out all the available data for a job, try:\n\n```bash\nsacct -l -j <slurmjobid>    # replace <slurmjobid> with a valid job ID\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Select only the interesting data using the `-o` option. For example, to see job name, job ID, used memory, job state and elapsed wall-clock time, try:\n\n```bash\nsacct -o jobname,jobid,maxrss,state,elapsed -j <slurmjobid>   # replace <slurmjobid> with a valid job ID\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 5\"}\n6. Check out the list of all available data fields with:\n\n```bash\nsacct -e\n```\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Note, running `sacct` is heavy on the batch queue system.\n\n- You should not, for example, write scripts that run it repeatedly.\n\n## Running a test job\n\nüí¨ Run a simple array job to practice using `seff` and `sacct`.\n\n‚òùüèª If you have limited time, you can skip to [Examining the finished job](#examining-the-finished-job) and use the job ID `20363893` (it is the same job).\n\n1. Create a file named `array.sh` and paste the following contents in it.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>      # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n#SBATCH --time=00:01:00          # Maximum duration of the job. Max: depends of the partition. \n#SBATCH --partition=small        # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, hugemem_longrun\n#SBATCH --job-name=array_job     # Name of the job visible in the queue.\n#SBATCH --output=out_%A_%a.txt   # Name of the output-file.\n#SBATCH --error=err_%A_%a.txt    # Name of the error-file.\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1               # Number of tasks. Max: depends on partition.\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1        # How many processors work on one task. Max: Number of CPUs per node.\n#SBATCH --mem=1000               # How much RAM is reserved for job per node. Unit: MiB\n#SBATCH --array=1-6              # The indices of the array jobs.\n\n/appl/soft/bio/course/sacct_exercise/test-a ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Replace `<project>` with your actual project name, e.g. `project_2001234`\n3. Submit the job with the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch array.sh\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. You will see a message like:\n\n```bash\nSubmitted batch job 123456\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Make note of the Slurm job ID.\n6. Follow the progress of the job with the command:\n\n```bash\nsqueue -u $USER\n```\n\nüí≠ How is an array job listed in the queue?\n\n## Examining the finished job\n\n1. When the job has finished (you can no longer see any of the sub jobs with `squeue`), you can use `sacct` to study it:\n\n```bash\nsacct -j <slurmjobid>    # replace <slurmjobid> with the actual job ID\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Get a cleaner view by omitting the job steps:\n\n```bash\nsacct -X -j <slurmjobid>    # replace <slurmjobid> with the actual job ID\n```\n\nüí¨ `sacct` is especially handy here, because it is easy\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
