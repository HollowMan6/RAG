Alternatively, graphics can also be displayed over an SSH\nconnection using X11 forwarding. See the operating system-specific instructions:\n\n* [X11 forwarding on Linux and macOS](ssh-unix.md#graphical-connection)\n* X11 forwarding on Windows:\n    * [PowerShell](ssh-windows.md#graphical-connection-powershell)\n    * [PuTTY](ssh-windows.md#graphical-connection-putty)\n    * [MobaXterm](ssh-windows.md#graphical-connection-mobaxterm)\n\n### Advanced usage\n\n#### Connecting to a specific node\n\nWhen you connect to a supercomputer, you are automatically directed to one of\nthe login nodes on the system. However, you can also use your SSH client to\nconnect to a specific login node:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@<host>-login<id>.csc.fi  # e.g. 'puhti-login11.csc.fi'\n```\n\nThe available login nodes are:\n\n| Puhti | Mahti |\n|-|-|\n| `puhti-login11` | `mahti-login11` |\n| `puhti-login12` | `mahti-login12` |\n| `puhti-login14` | `mahti-login14` |\n| `puhti-login15` | `mahti-login15` |\n\nThis also applies to compute nodes, although just the ones where you have a\njob running. Use the `squeue` command to see which node(s) your job is on, and\nthen connect to a node using `ssh`.\n\n```bash\n# The nodes hosting the job are\n# displayed in the \"NODELIST(REASON)\" column.\n\n[username@puhti-login11 ~]$ squeue --me\n             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n          12345678      test     test username  R       0:01      1 r07c01\n[username@puhti-login11 ~]$ ssh r07c01\n[username@r07c01 ~]$ hostname\nr07c01.bullx\n```\n\nIf you try to connect to a node where you have no active jobs, you will\nreceive the following error message: `Access denied by pam_slurm_adopt: you\nhave no active jobs on this node`.\n\n#### Configuring SSH client\n\nYou can save yourself some time by adding host-specific options for CSC\nsupercomputers in an [SSH config file](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config)\n(e.g. `~/.ssh/config`).\n\n```bash\nHost <host>  # e.g. \"puhti\"\n    HostName <host>.csc.fi\n    User <csc-username>\n```\n\nNow you can connect to the host simply by running:\n\n```bash\nssh <host>\n```\n\n#### Remote development\n\nSome editors like Visual Studio Code and Notepad++ can be used to\n[work on files remotely](../../support/tutorials/remote-dev.md)\nusing an appropriate plugin.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
