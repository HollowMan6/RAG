Give your key a name and click in **Create Key Pair**. You will get a \"_keyname.pem_\" to save. Save it in your home directory. This will be the last time you will be able to download this **private key**, Pouta does not keep a copy in its servers.\n\n    ![Create key](../../img/pouta-create-key.png)\n\n    **Figure** The Create Key Pair dialog\n\n#### Linux and Mac\n\nIn order to install the key you downloaded in the previous step (_keyname.pem_ or _keyname.cer_), you must run this commands:\n\n!!! info \"For MacOS\"\n    If you are using Chrome browser in Mac OS X Monterey, you will get keyname.cer instead of keyname.pem. The following procedure will remain same.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh\nchmod 700 .ssh\nmv keyname.pem ~/.ssh\nchmod 400 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem\n```\n\n!!! info \"400 = Only owner can read\"\n    When a file in Unix has 400 permissions, it translates to:\n    `r-- --- ---`\n\n    which means, only the owner can read the file. This is the recommended value for SSH, but in case you need to overwrite the file, you will need to give also write permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem`.\n\n\nBefore using the newly created key, you should protect it with a passphrase:\n\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem\nssh-keygen -p -f .ssh/keyname.pem\nchmod 400 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem\n```\n\n#### Windows (PowerShell)\n\nIn **Windows** environments it is recommended to use PowerShell. The process is very similar\n\n```PowerShell\nmkdir ~/.ssh\nmv yourkey.pem ~/.ssh/\n```\n\nBefore using the newly created key, you should protect it with a passphrase:\n\n```PowerShell\nssh-keygen.exe -p -f yourkey.pem\n```\n\nThen, still from PowerShell, you can use the `ssh` command to connect to your machine, in the same way it is done from Linux or Mac.\n\n#### Windows (Putty)\n\nIf your copy of Windows does not have the _ssh_ command installed, it is also possible to use _Putty_.\n\nThis is done by using the _puttygen_ tool to load your private key (.pem) and save it in the (password protected) .ppk format which Putty can use.\n\n1. Download _Putty_ and _puttygen_, which are available at <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>.\n\n1. Run _puttygen_ and load the key you downloaded (it should be in the Downloads page).\n\n    ![Putty Gen](../../img/putty-load.png)\n\n1. Set a password to the key. This is not compulsory, but advised.\n\n1. Save the key in _ppk_ format, this is the default Putty format for keys.\n\n    ![Saved](../../img/putty-saved-ppk.png)\n\nNow we can use this new in Putty to connect to a Virtual Machine.\n\n1. Run _putty_ and load the ssh key. Go to **Connection > SSH > Auth > Credentials** and under **Private key file for authentication**, use the **Browse...** button to select the proper .ppk file.\n\n    ![Private key file for authentication](../../img/putty-key-file-authentication.png)\n\n1. Once the key is loaded, you will save the session. Go to the **Session** section and under **Saved Sessions** write the name of the new session and click save.\n\n### Firewalls and security groups\n\nSecurity groups are sets of firewall rules which limit access to your machines. A virtual machine can use one or more security groups. These firewall rules are made on the _OpenStack_ layer and you may have additional firewall rules within your virtual machine. In case of connectivity problems, you should make sure both the security group and the virtual machine's internal firewall are correctly configured. The \"Default\" security group comes with rules that allow internal communication between virtual machines that are members of the security group.\n\nA security group can be edited or created in any moment of the Virtual Machine life-cycle. Any change applied to a security group assigned to a Virtual Machine, will be applied instantly to the Virtual Machine.\n\n!!! warning \"Do not edit the default security group\"\n    As a good practice, we discourage changing the \"Default\" security group. We recommend instead that you create specific security groups for specific purposes and name them accordingly. For example create a security group called \"SSH-VPN\" to allow computers from the VPN to SSH/22 to the machines on that security group.\n\nIn order to create a new security group:\n\n1. Go to **Network > Security Groups**, and click in **Create Security Group**, name it and add a description.\n\n1. Then click in **Manage Rules**, and in the view that is displayed, click **Add Rule**.\n\n    ![Add rule](../../img/pouta-add-rules-secgroup.png)\n\n    There is a lot customization available, but in this case it is recommended to use the `SSH` rule that only requires one parameter: `CIDR`. The **Classless Inter-Domain Routing** or **CIDR** allows you to specify a subnet (`88.44.55.0/24`) or an specific IP (`88.44.55.77/32`).\n\n1. In order to find out your IP you can use services\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cPouta provides a web interface for managing access and security, including the creation and handling of SSH key pairs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>EVENT<|>A security measure for authentication to ensure secure access to servers, created and managed through the cPouta interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>An operating system that supports the installation of SSH keys through specific commands for secure access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAC<|>GEO<|>An operating system that supports the installation of SSH keys through specific commands for secure access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>An operating system that supports the installation of SSH keys through PowerShell or Putty for secure access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, used here for SSH key management on Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUTTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application, used for SSH key management on Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source software platform for cloud computing, where security groups and firewall rules are managed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIREWALLS AND SECURITY GROUPS<|>EVENT<|>Sets of rules that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules in OpenStack)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>CPOUTA<|>SSH Key Pairs are managed through the cPouta web interface for secure access<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>Linux supports the installation and management of SSH key pairs for secure access<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAC<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>Mac supports the installation and management of SSH key pairs for secure access<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>Windows supports the installation and management of SSH key pairs through PowerShell or Putty<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>WINDOWS<|>PowerShell is used for SSH key management on Windows<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUTTY<|>WINDOWS<|>Putty is used for SSH key management on Windows<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>FIREWALLS AND SECURITY GROUPS<|>OpenStack manages firewalls and security groups for virtual machines<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
