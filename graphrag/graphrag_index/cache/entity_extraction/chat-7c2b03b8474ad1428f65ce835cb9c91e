Enable\nthis feature by adding the `--mamba` flag, e.g. `conda-containerize new --mamba\n...`\n\nMake sure that you have read and understood the license terms for\n[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as well as any used\nconda channels before using the command:\n\n- [Terms of service](https://www.anaconda.com/terms-of-service)\n- [Anaconda FAQ](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/anaconda-commercial-edition-faq)\n\n#### End-to-end example of wrapping a Conda installation\n\nUsing the previous `env.yml`\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir MyEnv\n$ conda-containerize new --prefix MyEnv env.yml \n```\n\nAfter the installation finishes, we can add the installation directory to our\n`PATH` and use it like normal.\n\n```bash\n$ export PATH=\"$PWD/MyEnv/bin:$PATH\"\n$ python --version\n3.8.8\n$ python3\nPython 3.8.8 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 20 2021, 16:22:27) \n[GCC 9.3.0] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import scipy\n>>> import nglview\n>>> \n```\n\n### Modifying a wrapped Conda installation\n\nAs the wrapped installation resides in a container, it cannot be directly\nmodified. Small python packages can be added outside the container, in the\nusual way, using `pip`, but then the python packages are sitting on the\nparallel file system which is not recommended for larger installations.\n\nTo actually modify the installation inside the wrapping container, you can use\nthe `update` keyword together with the `--post-install <file>` option which\nspecifies a bash script with commands to run to update the installation. The\ncommands are executed with the Conda environment activated.\n\n```bash\n$ conda-containerize update <existing installation> --post-install <file> \n```\n\nwhere `<file>` could e.g. contain\n\n```bash\nconda  install -y numpy\nconda  remove -y pyyaml\npip install requests\n```\n\nIn this mode, the whole host system is available including all software and modules.\n\n### Wrapping a plain pip installation\n\nSometimes you don't need a full-blown Conda environment, or you may prefer to\nmanage your python installations using pip. For this case you can use the\n`pip-containerize` wrapper via\n\n```bash\npip-containerize new --prefix <install_dir> req.txt\n```\n\nwhere `req.txt` is a standard [pip requirements.txt file][pip-req]. The above\nnotes and options for modifying a Conda installation apply to pip installations\nas well.\n\nNote that the Python version used by `pip-containerize` is the first Python\nexecutable found on the `PATH`, so it is affected by loading modules.\n\n!!! note\n    This python used to installed pip packages cannot itself be container-based\n    as nesting of containers is not possible.  \n\nAdditionally, you may use the `--slim` argument, which will use a pre-built\nminimal python container with a much newer version of python as a base. Without\nthe `--slim` argument, the whole host system is available. However, by using\nthe `--slim` argument, the system installations (i.e /usr, /lib64 ...) are no\nlonger taken from the host, but are instead taken from the minimal python\ncontainer.\n\n### Wrapping existing containers\n\nThe LUMI container wrapper also provides a tool to generate wrappers for\nexisting Apptainer/Singularity containers, so that they can be used\ntransparently without the need for prepending `singularity exec ...`, or modify\nscripts if switching between containerized versions of tools.\n\n```bash\nwrap-container -w </path/inside/container> <container> --prefix <install_dir> \n```\n\nwhere `<container>` can be a filepath or any URL accepted by `singularity` (e.g\n`docker//:`, `oras//:`, or a local .sif file), and `-w` needs to be an absolute\npath (or comma-separated list) inside the container. Wrappers will then be\nautomatically created for the executables in the target directories or for the\ntarget path.\n\n### Additional examples\n\nMore examples may be found in the [LUMI container wrapper GitHub repository\nexamples](https://github.com/CSCfi/hpc-container-wrapper/blob/master/examples/).\n\n## How it works\n\nA description of how LUMI container wrapper works may be found in the [LUMI\ncontainer wrapper GitHub repository README\nfile](https://github.com/CSCfi/hpc-container-wrapper/blob/master/README.md). A\nshort discussion of how LUMI container wrapper works from the user perspective\nmay be found in [this GitHub\nissue](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/lumi-userguide/issues/110#issuecomment-1619599189).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
