Next, you need to fill in the SFTP (or secure connection) credentials, which correspond to your Central EGA account username. In SFTP Username, write your EGA username (usually this is your email address). In SFTP Server, write the following: `admin.sd.csc.fi:50529`. Loading an SFTP key is not required for data uploads to FEGA.\n\n6. Click on *Encrypt and upload files*. The tool will ask the SFTP Passphrase, which corresponds to your Central EGA account password. After clicking on OK, the application will start the data encryption and upload. \n\n7. The application is not provided with a progress bar. Data encryption and upload can take minutes or up to several hours, depending on the size of the dataset. Data upload is successfully finished when the activity log in the application visualises the following message: Disconnecting SFTP. SFTP has been disconnected.\n\n8. Please inform the Finnish FEGA helpdesk via email ([CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md)) when you have completed the data encryption and upload to Finnish FEGA. You will receive further instructions for the metadata submission.\n\n[![Fi-FEGA upload application](images/fega/fega_upload.png)](images/fega/fega_upload.png)\n\n### Option 2 - Command line interface\n**Data encryption with crypt4gh CLI**:\n\n1.\tPython 3.6+ is required to use the Crypt4GH encryption utility. If you need help with installing Python, please follow [these instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).\n\n2.\tOpen a terminal and install Crypt4GH directly with pip tool:\n\n    ```\n    pip install crypt4gh\n    ```\n\n3.\tTo encrypt a file with the [Finnish FEGA public encryption key](https://a3s.fi/fega-public-keys/fega-pubkey-c4gh.pub) use ```crypt4gh encrypt``` command:\n\n    ```\n    $ crypt4gh encrypt  --recipient_pk fega-pubkey-c4gh.pub < example_file.txt > example_file.txt.c4gh\n    ```\n\n    Where the syntax `--recipient_pk` defines the public key used to encrypt the data. In this case, Finnish FEGA public key. `example_file.txt` defines the input file and `example_file.txt.c4gh` output encrypted file. \n\n**Data upload with SFTP CLI (default in Linux and MacOS)**:\n\n1. Open a terminal and open the SFTP connection with the following syntax, where `ega_user` is the EGA credentials username (usually this is your email address):\n\n    ```\n    sftp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -P 50529 ega_user@admin.sd.csc.fi\n    ```\n\n    For the password, use your Central EGA account password.\n\n2. Transfer the encrypted files or directory with the *put* command, when you are connected to sftp.\n\n    ```\n    sftp> put example_file.txt.c4gh\n    ```\n\n    Data upload can take minutes or up to several hours, depending on the size of the dataset.\n\n3. Wait for the process to be completed before closing the connection. When the process is complete, you should see the files in the [submitter portal](https://submission.finland.ega-archive.org/) by going to Files from the menu. After you have confirmed that the process has completed, you can close the SFTP connection with `exit` command. It is important to disconnect when you have finished the upload.\n\n4. Please inform the Finnish FEGA helpdesk via email ([CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md)) when you have completed the data encryption and upload to Finnish FEGA. You will receive further instructions for the metadata submission.\n\n## Step 6: Data Access Committee and Policy registration\n\nData Access Committee (DAC) and Policy are created by CSC service desk separately from other metadata. DAC and policy must be finalised before they can be added to the metadata submission.\n\nTo register DAC and Policy for your dataset, contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md). For registration, you will need\n\n1. names and email addresses of all the Data Access Committee members;\n2. Data Access Agreement;\n3. other necessary information defining the conditions of data reuse, e.g. DUO codes; and\n4. data application link for each dataset (provided by CSC helpdesk).\n\n### Dataset application link\n\nAfter uploading the data to Finnish FEGA, you will receive a dataset application link for each dataset via email from the CSC Service Desk.\n\n!!! note\n    If someone wants to apply access to your dataset stored in Finnish FEGA, they must click the dataset application link on the EGA website. The link will direct the user to the application form in SD Apply. SD Apply is a service for applying access rights to sensitive datasets stored at CSC. There is a separate [guide](./fega-application.md) for applying data access.\n\n## Step 7: Metadata submission\n\nNext, you can describe all the information related to your study, non-sensitive public metadata, using the [Finnish FEGA submitter portal](https://submission.finland.ega-archive.org/) or programmatically. The public metadata will be published on the EGA website to facilitate data discovery and re-use.\n\nYou can get an introduction to the submitter portal from the video below or by taking the tour available in the portal by clicking the yellow book icon in the top right corner while you are logged in.\n\n\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"155\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDTNIE8Ex0g?si=QJlYwfAGERAHN-e9\" title=\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Central EGA refers to the European Genome-phenome Archive's central account system, which manages SFTP credentials and data upload processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SFTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Secure File Transfer Protocol used for data uploads to Finnish FEGA, requiring EGA account credentials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Finnish branch of the European Genome-phenome Archive, responsible for data encryption, upload, and metadata submission)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Helpdesk service provided by CSC for Finnish FEGA users, offering support for data encryption, upload, and metadata submission)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Encryption utility used for securing data before upload to Finnish FEGA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Programming language required for running the Crypt4GH encryption utility)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Committee created by CSC service desk for managing data access policies and agreements for datasets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD APPLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service for applying access rights to sensitive datasets stored at CSC)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL EGA<|>SFTP<|>Central EGA account credentials are used for SFTP data uploads<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINNISH FEGA<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>CSC Service Desk provides support for Finnish FEGA data encryption and upload processes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>PYTHON<|>Python is required to run the Crypt4GH encryption utility<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE (DAC)<|>SD APPLY<|>DAC policies and agreements are necessary for applying access rights through SD Apply<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
