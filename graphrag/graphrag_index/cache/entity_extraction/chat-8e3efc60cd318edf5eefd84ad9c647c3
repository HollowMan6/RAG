Please report any errors or problems with the GPGPUs\n    to CSC (and attach the output of the command \"nvidia-smi -q\").\n-   The applications must be able to utilize the GPU to get a speedup. Even\n    though there is no specific speedup target to be met to enable GPU usage\n    on Pouta, it is best to aim for higher speedups to compensate for the\n    relatively higher prices per hour associated with GPUs and their relative\n    scarcity.\n-   As the majority of computing resources in Pouta are CPU-based and GPU\n    resources are relatively limited, most likely, you will need to specify\n    your need for GPU resources in your application or make an additional\n    request via <servicedesk@csc.fi> to enable their usage on your existing\n    Pouta application.\n\nThese instances are also tightly tied to the hardware. You may expect\ndowntime of instances during the maintenance of the hardware.\n\nUsers also have the possibility to use NVIDIA Volta V100 GPGPUs in the\nbatch system on [Technical details about Puhti](../../computing/systems-puhti.md).\n\n**cPouta flavor characteristics:**\n\n**gpu.1.\\*:**\n\n-   No redundant power\n-   CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4, with hyper-threading\n-   Network: Redundant 10 Gb/s\n-   Flavor disk: Local SSD disks, RAID-1\n-   Instance can be lost due to a single-node or multiple simultaneous disk failures.\n\n**ePouta flavor characteristics:**\n\n**gpu.1.\\*:**\n\n-   Redundant power\n-   CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4, with hyper-threading\n-   Network: Redundant 10 Gb/s\n-   Flavor disk: Local SSD disks, RAID-1\n-   Instance can be lost due to a single-node or disk failure.\n\n**gpu.2.\\*:**\n\n-   Only available via request to servicedesk@csc.fi\n-   Redundant power\n-   CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6148, with hyper-threading\n-   NUMA Aware: yes (CPU &lt;&gt; memory, not PCI devices)\n-   Network: Redundant 10 Gb/s\n-   Flavor disk: Local SSD disks, RAID-0\n-   Instance can be lost due to a single-node or disk failure.\n\n**gpu.3.\\*:**\n\n-   Redundant power\n-   CPU: AMD EPYC 7402 24-Core Processor\n-   Network: Redundant 10 Gb/s\n-   Flavor disk: Local NVMe disks\n-   Instance can be lost due to a single-node or disk failure.\n-   Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is supported\n\n### Installation and configuration of GPU Flavors\n\nWe have specific CUDA images available for the GPU nodes.\nThese images come pre-installed with the freshest CUDA version. Note\nthat the CUDA images are not configured with auto update. You can use\nany other images with the GPU flavors, but you have\nto install the required libraries yourself.\n[How CSC customizes the images](adding-images.md).\n\n### High memory flavors (only in ePouta)\n\nTypical use cases:\n\n-   Scientific applications requiring large amounts of memory\n\nThese flavors have large amounts of memory and are meant for use cases\nwhich require and can utilize such amounts of memory. Typical use cases\nof these flavors include genome sequencing and analysis applications.\n\nThe resize/migration functionalities do not work for these instances.\n\nIf you need to move a workload from another type of VM to an instance with a high memory flavor, i.e., a TB instance, either move all data and install all applications manually\non the new TB instance or create a snapshot of the source VM. Then\nconvert that snapshot to a volume and use the volume to create the\nnew TB-flavor VM.\n\nIf you need to move a workload from a TB instance to another instance,\neither move all data and install all applications manually on a new\nVM or create a snapshot of the source VM. **Please note** that all\nephemeral disk data will be lost in the process and will not be stored\nin the snapshot because only the TB VM root disk is stored in the snapshot.\n\n**Flavor characteristics:**\n\n**tb.3.\\*:**\n\n-   Redundant power\n-   CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU  E5-2680 v4, with hyper-threading **or**\n    Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4, with hyper-threading\n-   Network: Redundant 25 Gb/s\n-   Flavor disk: Local SSD disks, RAID-0\n-   Instances can be lost due to a single-node or disk failure.\n\n## Deprecated flavors\n\nThis is the set of original flavors that has been available\nsince the launch. **You should not launch any new virtual machines using\nany of these flavors. Existing\nvirtual machines that use these flavors will continue to\nwork.** We will maintain these flavors for a period of time,\nbut they will be removed at some point in the near future.\n\n|Flavor|Cores|Memory <br/>(GiB)|Root<br/> disk <br/>(GB)|Ephemeral<br/> disk <br/>(GB)|Total<br/> disk <br/>(GB)|Memory/<br/> core <br/>(GiB)|Billing<br/> Units<br/>/h|\n|--- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
