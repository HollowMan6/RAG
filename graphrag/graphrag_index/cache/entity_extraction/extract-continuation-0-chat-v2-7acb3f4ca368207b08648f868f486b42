Now, you're ready to go.\n6. Let's do our first small task in Puhti: let's check our projects and that we have a one with access to Allas service! \n```bash\ncsc-projects\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 6\"}\n7. The first command `csc-projects` lists your projects. The second command `module load allas` loads the Allas tools in your use. The third command `allas-conf` sets up the connection to Allas: it will ask for your CSC password, and then you need to select which project you want to use (by typing the number of the project, for example `2`). If you don't see a project here, please return to [CSC account and project](credentials.md) tutorial and see that you have a project with access to Allas service. Please note, that it can take up to 1h after accepting the terms of use before the service is in use.\n\n### Remote graphics\n\n💬 Remote graphics may not work by default. Try the [Puhti web interface](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/webinterface/) for running graphical applications. Another option is to enable X11-tunneling as follows.\n\n#### On Linux/macOS\n\n1. Add X11-tunneling to your SSH connection by adding `-X` or `-Y` to your `ssh` command like this (replace `cscusername` with your CSC username):\n\n```bash\nssh -X cscusername@puhti.csc.fi\n```\n\nNote that on Mac you need to have an X server running, for example [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). You also need to set in your `.bashrc`\n\n```bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n```\n\n#### On Windows\n\n1. MobaXterm will actually tunnel the connection by default.\n2. WSL and PuTTY require that an X server is installed and running. One of the options is [Xming](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/).\n3. In PuTTY, X11 forwarding is enabled in the connection settings: `Connection -> SSH -> X11: Enable X11 forwarding`.\n4. If you are using WSL, you need to set either of the environment variables below in your `.bashrc` (depends on the version of WSL you are running):\n\n```bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n# or\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\n```\n\n☝🏻 For intensive remote graphics we recommend using the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/).\n\n## More information\n\n💭 [Docs: Connecting](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC - TIETEEN TIETOTEKNIIKAN KESKUS - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Finnish IT center for science providing high-performance computing resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI.CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Atos BullSequana X400 computing infrastructure with 682 CPU nodes and 80 GPU nodes provided by CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICEdesk<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contact point for CSC services, offering support via phone and email)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage service provided by CSC for high-performance computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI WEB INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A web interface provided by CSC for running graphical applications on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XQUARTZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An X server for macOS, enabling X11-tunneling for remote graphics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A terminal for Windows that supports X11 forwarding by default)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XMING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An X server for Windows, enabling X11 forwarding for remote graphics)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC - TIETEEN TIETOTEKNIIKAN KESKUS - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>PUHTI.CSC.FI<|>Puhti.csc.fi is part of the computing resources provided by CSC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC - TIETEEN TIETOTEKNIIKAN KESKUS - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>SERVICEdesk<|>The Servicedesk is the support wing of CSC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC - TIETEEN TIETOTEKNIIKAN KESKUS - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>ALLAS<|>Allas is a storage service provided by CSC for its users<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC - TIETEEN TIETOTEKNIIKAN KESKUS - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>PUHTI WEB INTERFACE<|>The Puhti Web Interface is a service offered by CSC for accessing Puhti's resources<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>XMING<|>Both MobaXterm and Xming provide X11 forwarding capabilities for Windows users<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
