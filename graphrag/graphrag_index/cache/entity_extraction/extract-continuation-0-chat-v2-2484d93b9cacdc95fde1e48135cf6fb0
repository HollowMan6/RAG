Containers and Apptainer\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 4\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/singularity/singularity-tutorial_how_to_get_containers.html\n---\n\n# How to get containers\n\n💬 Building containers from scratch requires root privileges, so it can not be\ndone on Puhti as is.\n\n- Instead, you will have to import a ready image file (or use\n  [Tykky](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/) if containerizing a\n  Conda/pip environment). There are various options to do this.\n- Alternatively, `fakeroot` feature can be used to build containers without\n  root privileges. [See a separate tutorial on this topic](creating-containers.md).\n\n## 1. Run or pull an existing Singularity container from a repository\n\n1. It is possible to run containers directly from a repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer run shub://vsoch/hello-world:latest\n   ```\n\n   - This can, however, lead to a batch job failing if there are network\n     problems.\n\n2. Usually it is better to pull the container first and then use the image\n   file:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer pull shub://vsoch/hello-world:latest\n   apptainer run hello-world_latest.sif\n   ```\n\n## 2. Convert an existing Docker container to an Apptainer container\n\n💬 Docker images are downloaded as layers. These layers are stored in a cache\ndirectory.\n\n- Default location of the cache is `$HOME/.singularity/cache`.\n- Since the home directory has limited capacity and some images can be large,\n  it's best to set `$SINGULARITY_CACHE` to point to some other location with\n  more space.\n\n### Option A\n\n1. If you're running on a node with no fast local storage, you can use e.g. `/scratch`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>/$USER    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/scratch/<project>/$USER  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n### Option B\n\n1. If you're running interactively or as a batch job on an I/O node, you can\n   use the fast local storage:\n\n   ```bash\n   export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH\n   export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH\n   ```\n\n2. Avoid some unnecessary warnings by unsetting a certain environment variable:\n\n   ```bash\n   unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\n   ```\n\n3. You can now run `singularity build`:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer build alpine.sif docker://library/alpine:latest\n   ```\n\n💡 You can find more detailed instructions on converting Docker containers in\n[Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/creating/#converting-a-docker-container).\n\n## 3. Build the container on another system and transfer the image file to Puhti\n\n‼️ To do this you will need access to a system where you have root privileges\nand that has Apptainer installed.\n\n1. You can check the current Apptainer version on Puhti with:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer --version\n   ```\n\n2. After creating an image file, you can transfer it to Puhti.\n\n## More information\n\n💬 This tutorial is meant as a brief introduction to get you started.\n\n☝🏻 When searching online for instructions, pay attention that the instructions\nare for the same version of Apptainer as you are using. There has been some\ncommand syntax changes etc. between versions, so older instructions may not\nwork as is. Also note that Apptainer was formerly known as Singularity.\n\n💡 For more detailed instructions, see the official\n[Apptainer documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a computing environment where users cannot build containers from scratch due to the lack of root privileges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tykky is a service provided by CSC for containerizing Conda/pip environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAKEROOT<|>EVENT<|>Fakeroot is a feature that allows building containers without root privileges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer, formerly known as Singularity, is a container platform used for running and building containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VSOCH/HELLO-WORLD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vsoch/hello-world is a container repository on Singularity Hub)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a platform and tool for building, distributing, and running containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCS CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docs CSC provides documentation and guides for computing services offered by CSC, including container technology)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>TYKKY<|>Tykky is an alternative offered on Puhti for containerizing environments without root privileges<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>FAKEROOT<|>Fakeroot feature can be used on Puhti to build containers without root privileges<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>VSOCH/HELLO-WORLD<|>Apptainer can run or pull containers from the vsoch/hello-world repository<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER<|>APPTAINER<|>Docker containers can be converted to Apptainer containers for use on systems like Puhti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCS CSC<|>DOCKER<|>Docs CSC provides detailed instructions on converting Docker containers to Apptainer format<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
