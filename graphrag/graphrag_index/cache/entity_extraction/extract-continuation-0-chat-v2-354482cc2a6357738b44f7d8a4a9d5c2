Pouta clouds ([cPouta] and [ePouta]), like other IaaS clouds, offer more flexibility than traditional bare metal computing environments do, allowing new and better designs.\n\nThe recommendations listed below are focused on what Pouta provides to you and how your applications can profit from it. Is not an exhaustive list of all best practices. You can additionally follow a larger set of [practices] as mentioned by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation], various online literature on\nOpenStack such as its technical blogs, user guides, user stories etc. In real scenarios, some of these practices may not be applicable to your application, but applying practices that are suitable is the key takeaway of this article.\n\n## Stateless and disposable Virtual Machine nodes\n\nIf possible, try to develop your application in the form of distributed\nstateless _microservices_ that are responsible for independent computational sub-tasks and communicate among each other through a well defined interface. This is largely possible by the fact that you can create new VMs and reserve storage in a matter of a couple of minutes.\n\nData, which in most situations is irreplaceable, needs to be stored in separate data storage services that are persistent in nature, and not in the VM itself. In Pouta clouds, we\noffer _Object storage_ ([Allas]) and _Volume storage_ ([Cinder]).\n\nThe application will be more **resilient**. Running stateless VMs where the data is stored in redundant services like [Cinder] or [Allas] (managed by a dedicated teams of professionals), minimizes the impact of failures. If the hardware that runs the VM suddenly fails, data will not be lost. This removes single points of failure (SPoF).\n\n<center>![Stateless VM](../../img/stateless_VM.drawio.png)\n\n*Stateless VMs*</center>\n\n## Readily scalable (horizontal vs vertical)\n\nIf an application follows the _microservice_ approach (mentioned in the previous topic), it will allow easy **horizontal** scaling, i.e. add or remove replicas of the same VM. This approach is sometimes more complex, as you will need to use a suitable design that allows distributed computing. A load balancer of some kind will also be needed to distribute work among the VMs.\n\nAfter that hurdle is passed, it will be then less complex to horizontally **scale up and down** the application. If the computing and the data are not hardly coupled, the design will allow adding or removing Virtual machine replicas. Having more replicas also allows to spread the computation nodes across the computer center and minimizes (even more) the impact of individual failures, again lowering the number of SPoF. As already mentioned, the scale up and down is done in a matter of minutes thanks to the nature of Pouta.\n\nFor applications that do not allow the _microservice_ approach, Pouta allows easy **vertical** scaling, i.e. *VM resize* to change the VM [flavor] and add or remove compute resources (CPUs, RAM, disk etc.). It is very fast as it requires only a short reboot. The software running in the VM will transparently see more resources after the reboot. It is not necessary to reinstall the software. This is a complement (or alternative) to horizontal scaling (replication).\n\n<center>![scale](../../img/scale.drawio.png)\n\n*Horizontal vs Vertical scaling*</center>\n\n!!! info \"auto scale\"\n\n    In Pouta clouds, you could also programmatically scale your Heat stack using [OpenStack Heat resources] like *OS::Heat::ResourceGroup*,*OS::Heat::AutoScalingGroup* and *OS::Heat::ScalingPolicy*.\n\n## Isolated deployments for testing and production\n\nYou **must** have several isolated deployment environments, at least **testing** and **production**. Even though the names might vary, and more environments might be suitable. There must be a **testing** environment where you and your teammates will experiment with changes and validate that they work as designed. And a **Production** environment which is dedicated to your users. Issues should be found and solved in **testing** before they can get to **production**. Pouta allows you to request several computing projects that will be isolated among themselves by construction. \n\n!!! info \"Common saying\"\n\n    Everybody has a testing environment. Some people are lucky enough enough to have a totally separate environment to run production in.\n\nOther common deployment types include:\n\n* **Pre-production**, which is in between test and production where a stable copy of production is kept but no users have access to it. Changes will go through pre-production before they arrive to production. This is useful to make a last and integrated test of a bunch of individual changes together. The environment will normally be frozen for some time before the changes are applied to production. It is common that a sub-community of friendly users (like the development team) might be using this environment so a real life test can be done (eat your own dog food).\n\n* **Development**, where each team or developer will have its own playground to break and test individual changes. There are normally several of these environments and they are disposable.\n\n## Backups\n\nBackups are critical to any application. They protect data against _accidental deletion_, _hardware failure_, _corruption_, _ransomware_ and more. There are several data backup strategies. Depending on the application and the data it contains, the backup strategy might vary. Factors like cost, complication to setup, and reproducibility of the data, affect the strategy to follow. Pouta clouds do not provide a backup solution, but help setting up\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>POUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta provides cloud services, including cPouta and ePouta, offering flexibility and resources for application development and deployment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD NATIVE COMPUTING FOUNDATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that provides a set of practices for cloud-native application development, mentioned as a reference for best practices in application development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Object storage service offered by Pouta clouds for data storage needs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Volume storage service offered by Pouta clouds, used for persistent data storage separate from VMs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUTA<|>ALLAS<|>Allas is an object storage service managed by Pouta<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUTA<|>CINDER<|>Cinder is a volume storage service managed by Pouta<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUTA<|>CLOUD NATIVE COMPUTING FOUNDATION<|>Pouta's practices for application development are aligned with the standards and recommendations provided by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
