These examples only use a small subset of the options. For a list of\nall possible options, see the\n[Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).\n\nThe general syntax of an `#SBATCH` option:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH option_name argument\n```\n\nIn our example,\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=myTest\n```\n\nsets the name of the job to *myTest*. It can be used to identify a job in the\nqueue and other listings.\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n```\n\nsets the billing project for the job. Please replace `<project>` with the Unix\ngroup of your project. You can find it in [My CSC](https://my.csc.fi) under the\n*Projects* tab. [More information about billing](../../accounts/billing.md).\n\n!!! warning \"Remember to specify the billing project\"\n    The billing project argument is mandatory. Failing to\n    set it will cause an error:\n\n    ```text\n    sbatch: error: AssocMaxSubmitJobLimit\n    sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)\n    ```\n\nThe runtime reservation is set with option `--time`:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n```\n\nTime is provided using the format `hh:mm:ss` (optionally `d-hh:mm:ss`, where\n`d` is _days_). The maximum runtime depends on the selected queue. **When the\ntime reservation ends, the job is terminated regardless of whether it has\nfinished or not**, so the time reservations should be sufficiently long. Note\nthat a job consumes billing units according to its actual runtime.\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G\n```\n\nsets the required memory per requested CPU core. If the requested memory is\nexceeded, the job is terminated.\n\nThe partition (queue) needs to be set according to the job requirements. For\nexample:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n```\n\n!!! info \"Available partitions\"\n    [See the available batch job partitions](batch-job-partitions.md).\n\nThe user can be notified by email when the job *starts* by using the\n`--mail-type` option\n\n```bash\n##SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN          # Uncomment to enable mail\n```\n\nOther useful arguments (multiple arguments are separated by a comma) are `END`\nand `FAIL`. By default, the email will be sent to the email address linked to\nyour CSC account. This can be overridden with the `--mail-user=` option.\n\nAfter defining all required resources in the batch job script, set up the\nrequired environment by loading suitable modules. Note that for modules to be\navailable for batch jobs, they need to be loaded in the batch job script.\n[More information about environment modules](../modules.md).\n\n```bash\nmodule load myprog/1.2.3\n```\n\nFinally, we launch our application using the requested resources with the\n`srun` command:\n\n```bash\nsrun myprog -i input -o output\n```\n\n## Serial and shared memory batch jobs\n\nSerial and shared memory jobs need to be run within one compute node. Thus, the\njobs are limited by the hardware specifications available in the nodes. On\nPuhti, each node has two processors with 20 cores each, i.e. 40 cores in total.\n[See more technical details about Puhti](../systems-puhti.md).\n\nThe `#SBATCH` option `--cpus-per-task` is used to define the number of\ncomputing cores that the batch job task uses. The option `--nodes=1` ensures\nthat all the reserved cores are located in the same node, and `--ntasks=1`\nassigns all reserved computing cores for the same task.\n\nIn thread-based jobs, the `--mem` option is recommended for memory reservation.\nThis option defines the amount of memory required *per node*. Note that if you\nuse `--mem-per-cpu` option instead, the total memory request of the job will be\nthe memory requested per CPU core (`--mem-per-cpu`) multiplied by the number of\nreserved cores (`--cpus-per-task`). **Thus, if you modify the number of cores,\nalso check that the memory reservation is appropriate.**\n\nTypically, the most efficient practice is to match the number of reserved cores\n(`--cpus-per-task`) to the number of threads or processes the application uses.\nHowever, always [check the application-specific details](../../apps/index.md).\n\nIf the application has a command-line option to set the number\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment where users can submit batch job scripts to reserve resources and run commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm is a workload manager used for submitting, scheduling, and managing jobs on high-performance computing resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYPROG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Myprog is an example of a software module that can be loaded and run in a batch job script on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>My CSC is an online portal for users of CSC services where they can manage their projects and find their Unix group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is the Finnish IT center for science, providing high-performance computing resources like Puhti)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>SLURM<|>Puhti uses Slurm as its workload manager for job submission and scheduling<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY CSC<|>CSC<|>My CSC is an online portal provided by CSC for managing projects and services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYPROG<|>PUHTI<|>Myprog is an example of a software that can be loaded and executed in Puhti's computing environment<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
