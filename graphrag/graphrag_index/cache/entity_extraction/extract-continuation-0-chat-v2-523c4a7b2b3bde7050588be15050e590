One task starts in the node,\nwhich has access to all 40 CPU cores in the node. Since we reserve all the\ncores, we can reserve all the memory and all the local disk all the same, no\nneed to be stringy here. The last line, `#SBATCH --array=0,24`, tells the batch\nsystem to execute 25 copies of this job, each job identified by a unique number\nin environment variable `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`. Depending on the queue situation,\nmany of these jobs can run in parallel.\n\nNext we load a module providing\n[GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/). We use this tool\nwithin the node to \"schedule\" all 3200 runs in a job, so that at any point\nin time all 40 cores are busy, but not overloaded.\n\nNext lines calculate which directories belong to the current array job, using\nthe `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` environment varible.\n\nThe main \"loop\" of the script is implemented with GNU parallel command\n`parallel`. With the option `-j $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` we tell GNU parallel to\nkeep running 40 commands (applications) in parallel. Since we need to copy\nfiles into and out from the local SSD for each run, we wrap our application in a\nsmall shell script, `wrapper.sh`, which takes the input file name as an\nargument. The names of the input files are fed to GNU parallel through a pipe,\nand GNU parallel keeps on running the `bash wrapper.sh <input file>` command as\nlong as there are arguments in the pipe.\n\nSeparating the wrapper script from the batch job script makes it possible to\ndevelop and test each other separately. In general, use small test sets when\ndeveloping the workflow, and do not expect to get it perfect on the first try.\nYou can study and test a small version of the example case with\n\n```\nexport SBATCH_ACCOUNT=<your project>\nwget -c https://a3s.fi/docs-files/support/tutorials/many.tar.gz -O - | tar xz\ncd many\nbash create_inputs.sh\ntree /scratch/${SBATCH_ACCOUNT}/many\nsbatch job.sh\n```\n\n!!! Note\n    Running multiple separate jobs inside a larger allocation may result in\n    idle resources. Please make sure that such a job has a lot of quick jobs\n    to run, so that the last running job is not keeping the complete allocation\n    alive for long. Thus, the length of a subjob should be much less than\n    the duration of the allocation, and the number of subjobs much larger\n    than the cores requested in one task.\n\nYou can use [seff](../faq/how-much-memory-my-job-needs.md) to learn how long \npast jobs have been.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used for submitting, scheduling, and managing jobs on a computing cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU PARALLEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WRAPPER.SH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wrapper.sh is a shell script used to manage the execution of tasks, particularly for handling file transfers and executing applications in a computing environment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM<|>GNU PARALLEL<|>SLURM schedules jobs that utilize GNU Parallel for executing tasks in parallel on a computing cluster<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GNU PARALLEL<|>WRAPPER.SH<|>GNU Parallel uses wrapper.sh to execute commands or tasks in parallel, managing the workload across multiple CPU cores<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
