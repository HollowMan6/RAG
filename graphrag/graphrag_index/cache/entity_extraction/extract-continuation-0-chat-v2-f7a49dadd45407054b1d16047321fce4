It has modules for\n*drug design* and *materials science*. It can be used to build, edit, run and analyze\nchemical model systems.\n\nSchrödinger Maestro provides access to the\n[Desmond molecular dynamics engine](https://video.csc.fi/media/t/0_3udcx6bk),\nwhich runs **very well** on GPUs. We recommend watching the\n[video below](#video-how-to-run-a-desmond-simulation-on-puhti)\non how to set up and run Desmond MD simulations on Puhti easily.\n\nSee also the [bottom of this page](#more-information) for links to further\nself-learning materials.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2022.4, 2023.1, 2023.2, 2023.3, 2023.4, 2024.1, 2024.2, 2024.3\n* Mahti: 2022.4, 2023.1, 2023.2, 2023.3, 2023.4, 2024.1, 2024.2, 2024.3\n\n!!! info \"Pay attention to efficiency on Mahti\"\n\n    Note that Mahti is mostly suitable for running Desmond MD simulations on GPUs.\n    Most other jobs do not scale to full nodes, so please use Puhti instead for these.\n\n!!! info \"Module cleaning policy\"\n\n    A two-year cleaning cycle is applied on the Maestro modules on CSC supercomputers.\n    Specifically, this means that module versions older than two years will be removed.\n    This policy is enforced to free up disk space and encourage use of the latest versions\n    which tend to be more performant and have less bugs.\n\n!!! info \"Some notes about warnings\"\n\n    Maestro gives a warning for using a `schrodinger.hosts` file from your home\n    directory. This is **not an issue**: that file cannot be made available in\n    the installation directory, so please ignore the warning, but consider any\n    others you may see.\n\n    Also, starting from module version `maestro/2023.1` you might get warnings\n    about missing graphics libraries. These warnings should be harmless.\n    Nonetheless, if you would encounter unfamiliar issues using these Maestro\n    versions, please [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\n## License\n\nMaestro is available for all academic users in Finland: staff and students, for academic\npurposes. Please consult the [EULA](https://www.schrodinger.com/maestro-academic-eula)\nfor the exact definition. Using Maestro means that you accept the EULA linked to above.\nThe Maestro license consists of floating licenses and tokens. If licenses run out, contact\nus via [ServiceDesk](/support/contact/).\n\n## Usage\n\nIt is recommended to download and install Maestro on your own computer, see below.\n\n### Local Installation\n\nMaestro can be installed on a Linux, Mac or Windows computer. Download the appropriate files\nfrom [the Schrödinger website](https://www.schrodinger.com/). You don't need a license to\n*download* the software, although you need to register to the Schrödinger website, but you'll\nneed to configure licensing before you can *run* it. [See these instructions on how to configure\nlicensing](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=130528861) (requires Haka\nauthentication). Access to the license requires that your computer is in the FUNET network, i.e.\nyou're at the university or connected to it via VPN from home.\n\n### Standalone usage on Puhti\n\n!!! info \"Please update your `schrodinger.hosts` file\"\n\n    The login nodes of Puhti were renamed following the RHEL8 upgrade in October 2022.\n    Consequently, old `schrodinger.hosts` files referencing `puhti-login1` will not work\n    anymore! Please update your hosts file either manually by replacing all occurrences of\n    `login1` with `login11`, or by deleting your old `schrodinger.hosts` file and setting a\n    new one by running the `/appl/soft/chem/schrodinger/set-hosts-file.bash` script.\n    \n    Also, using public host addresses (ending with `csc.fi`, e.g. `puhti-login11.csc.fi`) in\n    the hosts file might cause timeout issues, so these should be changed to internal ones,\n    i.e. `puhti-login11` (without `csc.fi`).\n\n!!! warning \"Puhti vs. Mahti\"\n\n     We mainly recommend using Puhti to run your Maestro jobs. If running on\n     Mahti, you must ensure that your jobs are able to utilize full nodes\n     (128 CPU cores). Preferably, run only Desmond MD simulations on GPUs\n     because most other jobs do not scale. If in doubt, [contact us](/support/contact/).\n\nIt is possible to run heavier computations on Puhti. Here, a brief overview is given.\nAdditional details and some diagnostics tips are explained in our [Maestro power usage\ntutorial](../support/tutorials/power-maestro.md). See also the video below.\n\nFirst, you need to [get a CSC account](../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md)\nand apply for [access to Puhti](../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md).\nBefore you start the actual workflow below, you need to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCHRÖDINGER MAESTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A versatile molecular modeling environment with modules for drug design and materials science, providing access to the Desmond molecular dynamics engine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESMOND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS ENGINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computational engine for running molecular dynamics simulations, recommended for use on GPUs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC supercomputer recommended for running Desmond MD simulations and other computational tasks, subject to a module cleaning policy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC supercomputer mostly suitable for running Desmond MD simulations on GPUs, with a focus on efficiency and full node utilization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Finnish IT center for science, providing supercomputers like Puhti and Mahti for academic purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHRÖDINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The company behind Maestro and the Desmond molecular dynamics engine, offering software for molecular modeling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUNET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Finnish University and Research Network, a requirement for accessing the Maestro license from the Schrödinger website)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHRÖDINGER MAESTRO<|>DESMOND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS ENGINE<|>Schrödinger Maestro provides access to the Desmond molecular dynamics engine for simulations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>MAHTI<|>Both Puhti and Mahti are CSC supercomputers recommended for different types of Desmond MD simulations, with Puhti being more versatile<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHRÖDINGER MAESTRO<|>CSC<|>CSC provides access to Schrödinger Maestro for academic users in Finland<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHRÖDINGER MAESTRO<|>SCHRÖDINGER<|>Schrödinger is the company that developed Maestro and the Desmond molecular dynamics engine<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHRÖDINGER MAESTRO<|>FUNET<|>Access to the Maestro license requires a connection to the FUNET network<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
