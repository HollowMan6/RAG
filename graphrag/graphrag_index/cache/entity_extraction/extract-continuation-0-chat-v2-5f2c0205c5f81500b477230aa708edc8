For example, to request 100 GB of storage, use option `--gres=nvme:100`. The local storage reservation is on a per node basis. Use the environment variable `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` in your batch job scripts to access the local storage on each node.\n\nMultiple resources can be requested with a comma-separated list.\nRequest both GPU and local storage:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:<number_of_gpus_per_node>,nvme:<local_storage_space_per_node>\n```\n\nMany GPU applications also support cpu multithreading but not all. If cpu threading is supported cpu cores for the application threading operations can be enabled using `--cpus-per-task` flag. The example below will use one GPU and 32 cores are available for cpu threading (32 is 1/4 of the CPU cores of a single node) also 950 GB local fast disk storage (1/4 of the total amount of local disk on a node). Ampere A100 GPU also has its own 40GB memory (and that memory will not need any reservation flag). Default amount of main memory allocated per GPU is 122.5GB\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --partition=gpusmall\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:1,nvme:950\n\n# If multithreading is OpenMP implementation then define also OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n```\n\nSo above example will use 1/4 of all resources on a GPU node and therefore four similar batch jobs could run on a GPU node.\n\n## Undersubscribing nodes\n\nIf an application requires more memory per core than there is available\nwith full node (2 GB / core) it is possible to use also a subset of\ncores within a node. Also, if the application is memory bound, memory\nbandwidth and the application performance can be improved by using\nonly a single core per NUMA domain or L3 cache (look at\n[Mahti technical description](../systems-mahti.md) for details.\nNote that billing is, however, always based on full nodes.\n\nWhen undersubscribing nodes, one should always set\n`--ntasks-per-node=X` and `--cpus-per-task=Y` so that `X * Y = 128`,\neven with pure MPI jobs. By default, Slurm scatters MPI tasks\n`--cpus-per-task` apart, i.e. with `--cpus-per-task=8` the MPI task\n**0** is bound to CPU core **0**, the MPI task **1** is bound to CPU\ncore **7** _etc._. Memory bandwidth (and application performance) is\nthe best when the tasks are executing on maximally scattered cores. As\nan example, in order to use 32 GB / core, one can run only with 8\ntasks per node as\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n\nmodule load myprog/1.2.3\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n\nsrun myprog -i input -o output\n```\n\nFor hybrid applications, one should use\n`OMP_PROC_BIND` OpenMP runtime environment variable for\nplacing the OpenMP threads. As an example, in order to run\none MPI task per NUMA domain and one OpenMP thread per L3cache one\ncan set\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\nexport OMP_PROC_BIND=spread\n\nmodule load myprog/1.2.3\n\nsrun myprog -i input -o output\n```\n\nPlease check also our [Mahti batch script examples](example-job-scripts-mahti.md) page.\n\n## Using interactive partition for non-parallel pre- or post-processing\n\nIn many cases the computing tasks include pre- or post-processing steps that are not able to utilize parallel computing.\nIn these cases it is recommended that, if possible, the task is split into several, chained, batch jobs and that the non-parallel\nprocessing is executed in the `interactive` partition of Mahti.\n\nIn the interactive partition the jobs can reserve just few cores so that the non-parallel tasks can be executed without wasting resources.  \nNote that you can use interactive partition also for non-interactive jobs and that you can link two batch jobs so that the second job starts\nonly when the first one has finished.\n\nFor example, say that we would like to post-process the _output_ file, produced with the very first MPI example job in this page. The post processing command:\n`python post-proc.py output` uses only serial computing and requires about 40 minutes and 3 GB of memory. Instead of including the post-processing\nto the main job it is reasonable to execute it as separate job in the interactive partition.\n\nJobs in interactive partition can reserve 1-8 cores and each core reserves 1.875 GB of memory. Thus in this case we will reserve 2 cores `--cpus-per-task=2` to have enough memory (3,75 GB) available\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a computing system that provides GPU nodes and local storage for IO intensive applications and supports various computing tasks including parallel and serial processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPU NODE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing node in Mahti system equipped with GPUs and fast local storage, suitable for IO intensive applications and GPU accelerated tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMPERE A100 GPU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of GPU available in Mahti's GPU nodes, featuring 40GB of its own memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OMP_NUM_THREADS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment variable used to define the number of CPU cores to be used for cpu multithreading in applications that support OpenMP implementation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERACTIVE PARTITION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A partition in Mahti system for executing non-parallel pre- or post-processing tasks without wasting resources, allowing for the reservation of a few cores)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPU NODE<|>MAHTI<|>GPU nodes are a part of the Mahti computing system, designed for specific types of computational tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMPERE A100 GPU<|>GPU NODE<|>Ampere A100 GPUs are equipped in Mahti's GPU nodes, providing significant memory and processing power for GPU accelerated tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OMP_NUM_THREADS<|>MAHTI<|>OMP_NUM_THREADS is utilized in Mahti's computing environment to manage CPU multithreading for applications<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERACTIVE PARTITION<|>MAHTI<|>The interactive partition is a feature of Mahti system designed for efficient execution of non-parallel tasks<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
