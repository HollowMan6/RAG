Some of\nthese nodes contain more memory than others as specified in the table below.\n\n| Nodes | CPUs                                               | CPU cores     | Memory   | Disk | Network     |\n| :---: | :------------------------------------------------: | :-----------: | :------: | :--: | :---------: |\n| 1888  | 2x AMD EPYC 7763<br>(2.45 GHz base, 3.5 GHz boost) | 128<br>(2x64) | 256 GiB  | none | 1x 200 Gb/s |\n| 128   | 2x AMD EPYC 7763<br>(2.45 GHz base, 3.5 GHz boost) | 128<br>(2x64) | 512 GiB  | none | 1x 200 Gb/s |\n| 32    | 2x AMD EPYC 7763<br>(2.45 GHz base, 3.5 GHz boost) | 128<br>(2x64) | 1024 GiB | none | 1x 200 Gb/s |\n\nSee the [Slurm partitions page][slurm-partitions] for an overview of options\nfor allocating these nodes.\n\n## CPU\n\nEach LUMI-C compute node is equipped with two AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs with 64 cores\neach running at 2.45 GHz for a total of 128 cores per node. The cores have\nsupport for 2-way simultaneous multithreading (SMT) allowing for up to 256\nthreads per node.\n\nThe AMD EPYC 7763 CPU cores are [\"Zen 3\" compute cores][zen3-wiki], the same\ncore that can be found in the Ryzen 5000 series consumer CPUs. These cores are\nfully x86-64 compatible and support AVX2 256-bit vector instructions for a\nmaximum throughput of 16 double precision FLOP/clock (AVX2 FMA operations). The\ncores have 32 KiB of private L1 cache, a 32 KiB instruction cache, and 512 KiB\nof L2 cache.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/milan-overview.svg\" \n    width=\"560\"\n    alt=\"Overview of an AMD EPYC 7763 CPU\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Overview of an AMD EPYC 7763 CPU</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe EPYC CPUs consist of multiple chiplets, so-called core complex dies (CCDs).\nThere are 8 CCDs per processor with 8 cores each. The L3 cache is shared\nbetween the eight cores of a CCD and has a capacity of 32 MiB for a total 256\nMiB of L3 cache per processor. Note this differs from the earlier Zen 2 and\nEPYC 7002-series processors where 4 cores shared the L3 cache, and there were\ntwo groups of 4 cores (a \"CCX\") inside each CCD. This can improve the\nperformance of certain workloads as a single core can have access to more L3\ncache.\n\nThe CCD units are all connected to a central I/O die which contains the memory\ncontroller. There are 8 memory channels with a peak theoretical bandwidth of\n204.8 GB/s per socket.\n\nThe LUMI-C compute nodes are configured with 4 NUMA zones (\"quadrant mode\")\nwith 2 CCDs per quadrant. The figure below gives you an overview of the\ndistances between the NUMA nodes.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    align=\"left\" \n    src=\"../../assets/images/numa-lumic.svg\" \n    width=\"400\"\n    alt=\"Distances between NUMA nodes\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Distances between NUMA nodes</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe two processors within a node are connected by four bidirectional and 16-bit\nwide links operating at 16 Gbps each. This provides a peak bandwidth of 256 GB/s.\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_3\n\n## Network\n\nThe LUMI-C compute nodes each have a single 200 Gb/s interface to the [Slingshot-11\ninterconnect][interconnect].\n\n## Disk storage\n\nThere is no local storage on the compute nodes in LUMI-C. You have to use one of\nthe [network-based storage options][storage].\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-C<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI-C is a hardware partition consisting of 2048 CPU-based compute nodes equipped with AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs and varying memory capacities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMD EPYC 7763<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CPU model by AMD with 64 cores per CPU, supporting 2-way SMT, and equipped with Zen 3 compute cores)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZEN 3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A generation of AMD compute cores found in Ryzen 5000 series consumer CPUs and LUMI-C's AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs, supporting AVX2 256-bit vector instructions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLINGSHOT-11 INTERCONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A network interconnect technology providing a 200 Gb/s interface for LUMI-C compute nodes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-C<|>AMD EPYC 7763<|>LUMI-C compute nodes are equipped with AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMD EPYC 7763<|>ZEN 3<|>AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs use Zen 3 compute cores<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-C<|>SLINGSHOT-11 INTERCONNECT<|>LUMI-C compute nodes are connected via the Slingshot-11 interconnect<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
