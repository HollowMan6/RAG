Most commonly it is used in file format or coordinate system changes. \n\n## Available\n\nGDAL is available with following versions:\n\n* 3.9.2 - in the 3.38 [QGIS](qgis.md) in Puhti\n* 3.9.1 - in the 3.11.9 [geoconda](geoconda.md) in Puhti and Mahti\n* 3.8.3 - in the 3.31 [QGIS](qgis.md) in Puhti and LUMI\n* 3.6.2 - in the 3.10.x [geoconda](geoconda.md) in Puhti and Mahti\n* 3.4.3 stand-alone: `gdal` in Puhti\n* Also in Puhti: [r-env](r-env-for-gis.md#gdal-and-saga-gis-support) and [OrfeoToolBox](otb.md)\n\n!!! note\n    The stand-alone GDAL and R module don't have Python bindings installed so e.g `gdal_calc` works only in the geoconda and qgis modules. Also, the supported file formats vary between the modules. For example, the PostGIS driver is not available in stand-alone GDAL and r-env, but is included in the geoconda and qgis modules. Standalone GDAL also does not support virtual drivers to work with data from HTTPS or S3-links. To standalone and r-env GDAL installations it is possible to add more drivers, please ask. geoconda and qgis GDAL installation are impossible to change regarding drivers support.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Using GDAL\n\nGDAL is included in the modules listed above, so it can be used when any of these modules is loaded.\n\nIf you need to use a stand-alone version of GDAL or plan to build software on top of GDAL, you can load GDAL with\n\n`module load gdal`\n\nBy default the latest gdal module is loaded. If you want a specific version you can specify the version number\n\n`module load gdal/<VERSION>`\n\nYou can test if GDAL loaded successfully with following\n\n`gdalinfo --version`\n\nWith `r-env` gdal commands can be used as:\n\n`apptainer_wrapper exec gdalinfo --version`\n\n\n#### Using files directly from object storage services or cloud, inc Allas\n\nGDAL supports virtual [network based file systems](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#network-based-file-systems) for reading and sometimes writing from several cloud storage systems, inc CSC Allas, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure etc. Please check CSC's [Using geospatial files directly from cloud, inc Allas tutorial](../support/tutorials/gis/gdal_cloud.md) for instructions and examples.\n\n#### Virtual rasters\n\nWith large quantities of raster data (also in Allas), the most convenient method of accessing them might be [GDAL virtual rasters](../support/tutorials/gis/virtual-rasters.md). \n\n## License \n\n[GDAL is licensed under an MIT/X style license](https://gdal.org/license.html)\n\n## Citation\nGDAL/OGR contributors (2022). \nGDAL/OGR Geospatial Data Abstraction software Library. \nOpen Source Geospatial Foundation. \nURL https://gdal.org, \nDOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5884351\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nPlease acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072531) and the Open Geospatial Information Infrastructure for Research (Geoportti, urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072513) for computational resources and support\".\n\n\n## Installation \n\nStandalone GDAL was installed to Puhti using [Spack and its GDAL package definition](https://packages.spack.io/package.html?name=gdal).
