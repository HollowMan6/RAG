[Here's one tutorial that might be of use.](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-administration/postgresql-schema/)\n\nTo avoid confusion, keep in mind that in PostgreSQL 14 the default privileges allow every user to connect to any database and create tables in the default 'public' schema. They cannot access existing tables or other schemas without explicit permission, however, and they cannot create new schemas.\n\nYou can use the `openstack database user grant access` command to grant users all permissions on a specified database, which allows them to create their own schemas. They still can't access schemas and tables in them that are owned by other users without being given privileges, however. Typically the owner of an object in PSQL 14 (which can be a database, a schema, a table, etc. etc.) is the only one with any privileges regarding it, unless otherwise specified. This, combined with privileges not flowing 'downwards' in the hierarchy, can lead to some confusion. Having privileges to a schema doesn't imply any privileges to the tables contained within. For further reading, [here's the official docs on privileges.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-priv.html)\n\n### Example usage of privileges\n\nThese queries would allow the example_user to select data from the example_table. Note that the two queries are identical, as long as the search path hasn't been modified.\n\n```\nGRANT SELECT ON example_table TO example_user;\nGRANT SELECT ON public.example_table TO example_user;\n```\n\nKeep in mind example_user here means a role, which can also be a group. These queries would create a new group, assign a user to it, and grant privileges to select data from all tables in the public schema.\n\n```\nCREATE ROLE example_group;\nGRANT example_group TO example_user;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO example_group;\n```\n\nFor easier management of privileges, we recommend creating groups and assigning users to relevant ones instead of tweaking rights on a per-user basis.\n\n## PostgreSQL extensions\n\nIt is not possible for users to add additional extensions that are not already installed. If there\nare some extensions you would like to see available in Pukki, please be in contact with\n[CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).\n\n### How to enable extensions\n\n  1. You can enable extensions by first [enable root](operations.md#enable-root)\n  2. After that you can [log in to the database with the root user](#command-line)\n  3. Then you can enable the extension of your choice with:\n    ```\n    CREATE EXTENSION $EXTENSION_NAME ;\n    ```\n  4. After you are done, make sure that you disable root.\n\n\n\n### Currently available extensions\n \n<!-- This extension list can easily be generated with the following command:\nSELECT '| ' || name  AS name, default_version, comment || ' |' as comment FROM pg_available_extensions ORDER BY name;\n--->\n| Name  | Extension version | Extension description |\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |\n | address_standardizer           | 3.4.2           | Used to parse an address into constituent elements.
