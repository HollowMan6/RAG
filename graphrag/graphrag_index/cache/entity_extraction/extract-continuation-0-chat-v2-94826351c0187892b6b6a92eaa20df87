Pekka knows that if all users use the data with full access rights (read and write), there is a danger that somebody accidentally deletes or overwrites some part of the data. Thus, it is agreed that while the data is hosted by the data management project (project_2000444), the researchers access the data through the _HiaNo research project_ (project_2000333).\n\nPekka gives read access to the _hiano-project-sample001_ bucket for the project _project_2000333_ but no write access.\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf project_2000444\na-access +r project_2000333 hiano-project-sample001\n```\nXi and Laura can now start working with the data. They register using the MyCSC portal, after which Saara, who is the Principal Investigator, adds them to the CSC project _HiaNo research project_ (project_2000333).\n\nXi and Laura need to revisit MyCSC and accept the services of the research project. After that, they can download the research data they need to any environment that is able to connect to Allas: Puhti, a virtual machine in cPouta, or their own laptop. As new researchers join the project, Saara adds them in project_2000333, so that they can access the data.\n\nBecause storing data in Allas consumes billing units, Saara needs to check the saldo in MyCSC from time to time, and if needed, [apply for more billing units](../../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md) (80 TB consumes 700 800 Bu in year). Fortunately, HiaNo is an academic research project, so Saara does not need to pay for the billing units.\n\nAllas storage is only for research project's duration, but Saara thinks it would be beneficial to have the preliminary data made publicly available and easier to be found. This is supported by the [Fairdata Services](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/) produced by CSC.\n\nPekka creates a new bucket with public access and uploads the data to the bucket. Command _a-publish_ creates the bucket and uploads the selected files into it. Parameter `-b` is used to define the name for the bucket, in this case `hiano-project-public001`.\n```text\na-publish -b hiano-project-public001 zz_364872.dat zz_242165.dat\n```\nNext, Pekka creates a basic description of the data using the [Fairdata Qvain Tool](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/qvain/) and provides the two URLs (one for each file in Allas) as a Remote Resource in Qvain. After this, the data can be published as a dataset with a landing page and a persistent identifier. This way the preliminary data can be shared among colleagues using the persistent identifier. The dataset can also be explored via [Fairdata Etsin Service](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/etsin/) with structured information and direct access to download the files in Allas.\n\n\n## Act 5. The end ##\n\nAfter four years of intensive research that has expanded to several institutes in Finland and abroad, the HiaNo project has produced a few theses and many high quality publications (all acknowledging the use of CSC resources).  \n\nThe data is no longer actively used presently. A part of the data that was imported to Allas has been published in international research databases. Some datasets have been moved to [IDA](https://ida.fairdata.fi), so that a DOI identifier and metadata can be linked to the data to make it reusable by other researchers. These datasets can also be explored via [Fairdata Etsin](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/etsin/). Some data can now be deleted and some remaining parts be moved to the buckets of the new _HiaNo2_ project.\n\nAt this stage, Pekka cleans the remaining data objects from Allas, after which Saara informs CSC that the project can be closed.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DATA MANAGEMENT PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hosts the data for the research project with project ID project_2000444)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIANO RESEARCH PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Research project with project ID project_2000333, accessing data through a specific arrangement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIANO-PROJECT-SAMPLE001<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bucket name for data storage related to the HiaNo research project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEKKA<|>PERSON<|>Individual responsible for giving read access to the hiano-project-sample001 bucket for the HiaNo research project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XI<|>PERSON<|>Researcher working with the data in the HiaNo research project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURA<|>PERSON<|>Researcher working with the data in the HiaNo research project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAARA<|>PERSON<|>Principal Investigator of the HiaNo research project, responsible for adding researchers to the project and managing billing units)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Storage service used for hosting research data during the project's duration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Portal where researchers register and manage services related to CSC projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIRDATA SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Services produced by CSC, supporting the public availability and findability of preliminary data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIANO-PROJECT-PUBLIC001<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Publicly accessible bucket created by Pekka for sharing preliminary data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIRDATA QVAIN TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tool used for creating a basic description of the data and publishing datasets with a persistent identifier)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIRDATA ETSIN SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service for exploring datasets via structured information and direct access to download files in Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIANO2 PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The new project where some remaining parts of the data will be moved)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEKKA<|>HIANO RESEARCH PROJECT<|>Pekka manages data access for the HiaNo research project<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XI<|>HIANO RESEARCH PROJECT<|>Xi is a researcher in the HiaNo research project<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURA<|>HIANO RESEARCH PROJECT<|>Laura is a researcher in the HiaNo research project<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAARA<|>HIANO RESEARCH PROJECT<|>Saara is the Principal Investigator of the HiaNo research project<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIANO RESEARCH PROJECT<|>ALLAS<|>The HiaNo research project uses Allas for data storage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAARA<|>ALLAS<|>Saara manages billing units for data storage in Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEKKA<|>HIANO-PROJECT-PUBLIC001<|>Pekka creates and manages the hiano-project-public001 bucket for public data sharing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAIRDATA SERVICES<|>HIANO-PROJECT-PUBLIC001<|>Fairdata Services support the public availability of data in the hiano-project-public001 bucket<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIANO RESEARCH PROJECT<|>HIANO2 PROJECT<|>Data from the HiaNo research project is moved to the HiaNo2 project<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
