This page\nsummarizes how to move data using _a-commands_, _Swift_, _Rclone_ and _S3cmd_\nclients.\n\nAll the required packages and software needed for the clients are already\ninstalled on Puhti. To activate Allas and authenticate to a project you need to\nrun the commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf\n```\n\n## Move data with a-commands\n\n[a-commands](../../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md) are easy-to-use tools\nfor basic usage of Allas. The main commands to use for moving data between\nPuhti and Allas are:\n\n* [`a-put`](../../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md#a-put-uploads-data-to-allas):\n  Move data from Puhti to Allas\n* [`a-get`](../../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md#a-get-retrieves-stored-data):\n  Move data from Allas to Puhti \n\n## Move data with Swift\n\nThe Swift client provides the options `upload` and `download` for moving data:\n\n```bash\nswift upload <bucket name> <file name>\n```\n\n```bash\nswift download <bucket name> <file name>\n```\n\nFor more information, see\n[Swift client](../../data/Allas/using_allas/swift_client.md).\n\n## Move data with Rclone\n\nRclone is another client using which you can move data between Puhti and\nAllas. For example, you could create a bucket called `2000620-raw-data` in\nAllas using the command:\n\n```bash\nrclone mkdir allas:2000620-raw-data\n```\n\nUploading a file called `file.dat` to that bucket can be done using the\n`rclone copy` command:\n\n```bash\nrclone copy file.dat allas:2000620-raw-data/\n```\n\nDownloading the file back to Puhti is done with the same `rclone copy` command:\n\n```bash\nrclone copy allas:2000620-raw-data/file.dat .\n```\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Another destination directory can be specified in the `rclone copy` command\n    as well. If this directory does not exist, Rclone will create it for you.\n\n    ```bash\n    rclone copy allas:2000620-raw-data/file.dat my-new-folder\n    ```\n\nFor more information, see\n[Using Allas with Rclone from Puhti](../../data/Allas/using_allas/rclone.md).\n\n## Move data with S3cmd\n\nFor moving data between Puhti and Allas,\n[S3cmd](../../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md) provides the functions:\n\n* [`s3cmd put`](../../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md#create-buckets-and-upload-objects):\n  Move data from Puhti to Allas\n\n* [`s3cmd get`](../../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md#download-objects-and-buckets):\n  Move data from Allas to Puhti\n\nFor more information, see\n[S3 client](../../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
