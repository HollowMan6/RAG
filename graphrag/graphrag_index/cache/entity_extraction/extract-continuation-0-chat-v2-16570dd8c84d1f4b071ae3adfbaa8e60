Instead of submitting each of your computational tasks as separate Slurm\njobs or job steps, you can allocate a large resource block and then use HyperQueue to\nsubmit your tasks to this allocation. A single resource allocation will be much less\nstressful for the batch queue system and is the recommended way to run your high-throughput\ncomputing use cases. Furthermore, we can use HyperQueue instead of Slurm as the task\nexecutor for other workflow managers, such as Snakemake and Nextflow.\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [MIT License](https://github.com/It4innovations/hyperqueue/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 0.13.0, 0.15.0, 0.16.0\n* Mahti: 0.13.0, 0.15.0, 0.16.0\n* LUMI: 0.18.0\n\n## Usage\n\nInitialize the recommended version of HyperQueue on Puhti and Mahti like this:\n\n```bash\nmodule load hyperqueue\n```\n\nUse `module spider` to locate other versions. \nTo access CSC's HyperQueue modules on LUMI,\nremember to first run `module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles`.\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule load hyperqueue\n```\n\n### Task-farming with sbatch-hq tool\n\nFor simple task-farming workflows, where you only want to run many similar, independent,\nand non-MPI parallel programs, you can use the CSC utility tool `sbatch-hq`.\nJust specify the list of commands to run in a file, one command per line.\nThe tool `sbatch-hq` will create and launch a batch job that starts running\ncommands from the file using HyperQueue. You can specify how many nodes you\nwant to run the commands on, and `sbatch-hq` will keep executing the commands\nuntil all are done or the batch job time limit is reached.\n\nLet's assume we have a `tasks` file with a list of commands we want to run using\neight threads each. **Do not use `srun` in the commands!** HyperQueue will launch\nthe tasks using the allocated resources as requested. For example, \n\n```text\ncommand1 arguments1\ncommand2 arguments2\n# and so on\n```\n\nFor example, let's reserve one compute node for the whole job, which means we could\nrun either five tasks simultaneously using Puhti or 16 tasks simultaneously using Mahti.\n\n```bash\nmodule load sbatch-hq\nsbatch-hq --cores=8 --nodes=1 --account=<project> --partition=test --time=00:15:00 tasks\n```\n\nThe number of commands in the file can (usually should) be much larger than the number of\ntasks that can fit running simultaneously in the reserved nodes. See `sbatch-hq --help`\nfor more details on usage and input options.\n\n### Using HyperQueue in a Slurm batch job\n\nHyperQueue works on a worker-server-client basis. The server manages connections\nbetween workers and the client. The client submits tasks to the server, which sends\nthem to the available workers. The client and server may run on login or compute nodes,\nand the workers run on compute nodes. HyperQueue resembles a Slurm within a Slurm,\nbut you must start the server and workers yourself. We recommend reading the official\n[HyperQueue documentation](https://it4innovations.github.io/hyperqueue/stable/).\n\nThis example consists of a batch script and an executable task script. The batch\nscript starts the HyperQueue server and workers and submits tasks to the workers.\nThe task script is an executable script that we submit to the workers. You can copy\nthe following example, run it as given, and modify it to suit your needs. The\ndirectory structure looks as follows:\n\n```text\n.             # Current working directory\n├── batch.sh  # Batch script for HyperQueue server and workers\n└── task      # Executable task script for HyperQueue\n```\n\n**Task**\n\nWe assume that HyperQueue tasks are independent and run on a single node.\nHere is an example of a simple, executable `task` script written in Bash.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 1\n```\n\nThe overhead per task is around 0.1 milliseconds.\nTherefore, we can efficiently execute even very small tasks.\n\n**Batch job**\n\nIn a Slurm batch job, each Slurm task corresponds to one HyperQueue worker.\nWe can increase the number of workers by increasing the number of Slurm tasks.\nWe reserve a fraction of the CPUs and memory on a node per worker in a partial\nnode allocation and all the CPUs and memory on a node per worker in a full node\nallocation.\n\n=== \"Puhti partial single node\"\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=small    # single node partition\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1            # one compute node\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1  # one HyperQueue worker\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10   # one or more cpus per worker\n    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000   # desired amount of memory per cpu\n    #SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n    ```\n\n=== \"Puhti partial multinode\"\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HyperQueue is an efficient sub-node task scheduler designed to allocate large resource blocks for high-throughput computing use cases, supporting integration with workflow managers like Snakemake and Nextflow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIT LICENSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The MIT License is a free and open-source software license under which HyperQueue is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a computing environment where HyperQueue versions 0.13.0, 0.15.0, and 0.16.0 are available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is a computing environment where HyperQueue versions 0.13.0, 0.15.0, and 0.16.0 are available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>LUMI is a computing environment where HyperQueue version 0.18.0 is available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snakemake is a workflow manager that can utilize HyperQueue as the task executor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXTFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nextflow is a workflow manager that can utilize HyperQueue as the task executor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBATCH-HQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>sbatch-hq is a CSC utility tool for simple task-farming workflows, allowing the execution of many similar, independent, and non-MPI parallel programs using HyperQueue)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>MIT LICENSE<|>HyperQueue is licensed under the MIT License, making it free and open source<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>PUHTI<|>HyperQueue is available on Puhti for computational tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>MAHTI<|>HyperQueue is available on Mahti for computational tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>LUMI<|>HyperQueue is available on LUMI for computational tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>HyperQueue can be used as the task executor for Snakemake workflows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>NEXTFLOW<|>HyperQueue can be used as the task executor for Nextflow workflows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SBATCH-HQ<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>sbatch-hq utilizes HyperQueue for executing commands in task-farming workflows<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
