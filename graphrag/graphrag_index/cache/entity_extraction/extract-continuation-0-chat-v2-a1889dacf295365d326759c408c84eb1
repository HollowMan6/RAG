Users are responsible for making sure that the firewall rules are strict. The firewall rules should only be open to those IP-addresses that is needed. Relaxed firewall rules are probably some of the largest security risks and you need to take it seriously. Even if you don't have any \"secret\" data in your database, you are not allowed to have it open to the world. If you want to share your data, you should do it through a proxy or other services that might use the database as a backend. Leaving a database port open on the internet is an sure-fire way to attract malicious actors to target your database.\n\n## How to manage firewalls\n\nYou can change the firewalls from the [web interface](https://pukki.dbaas.csc.fi) on existing\ninstances by pressing the \"Update Instance\".\n\nWith the [openstack CLI](cli.md) tool you can use the `opsenstack database instance update --help` command.\nNote that the command override the existing firewalls rules which means that you need to set all\nthe firewall opening each time you update the firewalls for an instance with `--allowed-cidr` flag.\n\n## Single IP or subnet\n\nBy adding the \"CIDR notion\" `/32` to the end of an IP like `192.168.0.1/32` it means that you only\nallow that specific IP.\n\nIt is also possible to allow a subnet for example `/24` if you want to allow a whole network e.g.\nyour office network. The smallest mask that is allowed is `/22` that is 1024 IP addresses.\nPukki does not allow `0.0.0.0/0` since it would be too easy to set this value and forget that your\ndatabase instance is accessible from the whole internet.\n\n## Firewall openings from other CSC-services\n\nTo be able to access your database from other CSC services you need to allow some ingress traffic.\nThis is done by allowing subnets.\n\n### cPouta\n\n* If your server from where you want to connect to your database instances have a \"floating IP\"\n(public IP) you want to allow that IP in Pukki.\n* If your server does not have a floating IP you need to allow the routers \"External Fixed IPs\".\nYou can find the IP from the Pouta web interface under Network -> Routers -> The specific router ->\n\"External Fixed IPs\"\n\n\n### ePouta\n\nIt is important to remember that all traffic from ePouta to Pukki will be going over \"the internet\"\nwhich might be in conflict with why you have chosen to use ePouta in first place.\n\n1. If you still want to allow access to Pukki. You must ensure that your home organization firewalls\nwill allow traffic to your database instance in Pukki.\n2. If you are using a \"public IP range\" in ePouta then you can just update your database instance\nwith the new IP address with the \"CIDR notation\" (suffix) `/32`.\n\n### Rahti\n\nRahti is using a `86.50.229.150/32` as a shared outgoing IP address. Note that if you are using\nRahti with the shared outgoing IP-address all other Rahti customers can access to your database\nwhich makes it even more important to use a strong username and password for your database.\n\nMore information can be found in [Rahti security guide](../rahti2/security-guide.md)\n\n\n\n### Noppe\nIf you need to access your Pukki database instance from Noppe then you need to allow this IP\n`193.167.189.137/32` . Note that all other Notebook users will be able to access your database\ninstances as well so it is important to use strong passwords for your database user.\n\n### Puhti\n\nAccessing your Pukki database from login and compute nodes you can allow this:\n\n```\n86.50.164.176/28\n```\n\n<!--\nIf one would like to have even strictre rules one could limit it only these\npuhti-nat-[1,2].csc.fi and puhti-login[11-15].csc.fi\n-->\n\n### Mahti\n\nAccessing your Pukki database from Mahti from both login nodes and compute node you can allow this:\n\n```\n86.50.165.192/27\n```\n\n<!--\nSome alternatives:\n86.50.165.192/27\n86.50.165.200/30 + 86.50.165.208/28\n86.50.165.200/30 + 86.50.165.208/29 + 86.50.165.216/32\n86.50.165.200/30 + 86.50.165.211/32 + 86.50.165.212/30 + 86.50.165.216/32\n-->\n### LUMI\n\nAccessing your Pukki database from LUMI you need to allow the follow CIDR:\n\n```\n193.167.209.160/28\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUKKI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pukki is involved in managing database instances with strict firewall rules to protect against security risks and malicious actors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides services that include managing firewalls for database instances, as well as other computing and storage services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cPouta is a service provided by CSC for connecting to database instances with specific IP configurations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ePouta is a service by CSC that emphasizes security, with considerations for traffic going over the internet to Pukki)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti is a CSC service using a shared outgoing IP address, requiring strong security measures for database access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOPPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Noppe is another CSC service that requires IP allowance for accessing Pukki database instances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti allows access to Pukki databases from its login and compute nodes with specific IP allowances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti provides access to Pukki databases from login and compute nodes, requiring specific IP configurations for security)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI requires specific CIDR configurations to allow access to Pukki databases, emphasizing security)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUKKI<|>CSC<|>Pukki's database management and firewall services are provided by CSC<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPOUTA<|>PUKKI<|>cPouta services are configured to connect to Pukki databases with specific IP allowances<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPOUTA<|>PUKKI<|>ePouta's secure services are designed to connect to Pukki databases, considering internet traffic<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI<|>PUKKI<|>Rahti's shared outgoing IP address requires careful security measures for accessing Pukki databases<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOPPE<|>PUKKI<|>Noppe users need to allow specific IPs to access Pukki database instances, emphasizing strong passwords<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>PUKKI<|>Puhti allows database access from specific nodes to Pukki, requiring IP allowances<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>PUKKI<|>Mahti's access to Pukki databases is secured through specific IP configurations<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>PUKKI<|>LUMI's access to Pukki databases requires specific CIDR configurations for security<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
