Working efficiently with data\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/data-io/allas-local-rclone.html\n---\n\n# Using Allas with rclone from your local computer\n\nüí≠ The graphical user interfaces of Allas can normally manage data transfers\nbetween Allas and your local computing environment as long as the amount of\ndata and number of files is small. However, if you need to move large amounts\nof data, then using command-line tools like `rclone` or `allas-cli-utils` could\nbe a more efficient way to use Allas.\n\nüí¨ In this exercise, we'll study how you can use Allas from your own computer\nusing `rclone`, which is available for all common operating systems including\nWindows and macOS. Note that in macOS and Linux machines you can also install\nthe whole allas-cli-utils repository locally.\n\n## Step 1. Installing rclone\n\n‚òùüèª If you already have `rclone` command available, skip to [Step 2](#step-2-configuring-rclone-swift-connection-in-local-machine).\n\n1. Download `rclone` executable to your own machine. Executables can be found\n   from <https://rclone.org/downloads/>.\n2. In case of Windows, if you don‚Äôt know which version to choose, try the\n   [Intel/AMD 64 bit version](https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.66.0/rclone-v1.66.0-windows-amd64.zip).\n\n## Step 2. Configuring rclone-Swift connection in local machine\n\n1. Start the process by opening a command shell and executing command:\n    1. Windows: `.\\rclone.exe config`\n    2. Linux and macOS: `./rclone config`\n2. The configuration process in now done interactively in your command shell.\n   In case of Allas, you need to do the following selections:\n    1. Select **n** to create a *New remote*\n    2. Name the remote as: `allas`\n    3. From the list of storage protocols, select the number corresponding to:\n       *OpenStack Swift (Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)*\n    4. Select authentication option **2**: *Get swift credentials from\n       environment vars*.\n    5. Select the default blank setting for all the remaining settings until\n       you are back in the starting menu of the configuration process. \n    6. Finally, choose **q** to stop the configuration process.\n3. You need to do this configuration only once.\n\n## Step 3. Authentication\n\nüí≠ In addition to the configuration, you must define a set of environment\nvariables to authenticate your Allas connection each time you start using\n`rclone`. If you have access to Puhti, you can use it as an easy way to\ngenerate a list of commands to set the authentication:\n\n1. Open a terminal connection to Puhti and activate there a connection to the\n   Allas project you wish to use so that you add option `--show-powershell`\n   (Windows) or option `--show-shell` (macOS and Linux) to the `allas-conf` \n   command.\n2. With these options, the configuration process prints out environment\n   variable setting commands that you can run in your local machine to enable\n   authentication to Allas.\n\n### Windows PowerShell\n\n1. If your local machine is running Windows, execute the following commands in\n   Puhti:\n   ```bash\n   module load allas\n   allas-conf --show-powershell\n   ```\n2. Copy the last four lines, starting with `$Env:`, to the local PowerShell and\n   execute them. Then, test the `rclone` connection with command:\n   ```console\n   .\\rclone.exe lsd allas:\n   ```\n3. Note that also in this case the connection will work only for the next 8\n   hours. \n\n### macOS and Linux (bash and zsh)\n\n1. If your local machine is running macOS or Linux, then the default shell is\n   often `bash` or `zsh`. To activate Allas connection in these cases, run the\n   following commands in Puhti:\n   ```bash\n   module load allas\n   allas-conf --show-shell\n   ```\n2. Copy the last four lines, starting with `export`, to the local shell session\n   and execute them. Then, test the `rclone` connection with command:\n   ```bash\n   ./rclone lsd allas:\n   ```\n3. Note that also in this case the connection will work only for the next 8\n   hours.\n\n## Step 4. Upload and download from local computer\n\nüí¨ Use `rclone` to upload a small directory from your local computer to Allas.\nThe sample commands below are written for Windows PowerShell. In macOS and\nLinux you should replace `rclone.exe` with `rclone` and `.\\` in the directory\npaths with `./`.\n\n‚òùüèª For this test, choose some unimportant directory that contains only a small\namount of data (less than 1 GiB).\n\n1. First check what would be copied by running `rclone` command with option\n   `--dry-run`. Prefix the target bucket name in Allas with your username to\n   make it unique. So in the sample commands below you should replace\n   `local-directory` and `username` with you own values.\n   ```console\n   .\\rclone.exe copy -\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
