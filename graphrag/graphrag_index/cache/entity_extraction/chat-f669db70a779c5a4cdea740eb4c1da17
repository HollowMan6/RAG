The WhiteboxTools conda package installs only WhiteboxTools installer, therefore for proper installation of Whiteboxtools required additional post installation command and folder to wrap commandline tools.\n\n```bash\nconda-containerize new --mamba --prefix install_dir --post download_wbt -w miniconda/envs/env1/lib/python3.10/site-packages/whitebox/WBT/whitebox_tools geoconda_3.10.9.yml\n```\n\nGeoconda conda environment files and `download_wbt` and `start_wbt.py` needed for WhiteboxTools are available in [CSCs geocomputing repository](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/supercomputer_installations/geoconda). Note that for reproducibility, you'll need to define the package versions in the environment file, which can be checked on Puhti and Mahti using `list-packages` command after loading the `geoconda` module.\n\n\n## References\n\n-   [CSC Python parallelisation examples]\n-   [Python spatial] libraries\n-   [Geoprocessing with Python using Open Source GIS]\n-   [GeoExamples], a lot of examples of using Python for spatial analysis\n-   [Automating GIS processes course materials], where most of the exercises are done using Python (University of Helsinki)\n-   [Geohack Week materials]\n-   [Multiprocessing Basics]\n-   [Geographic Data Science with Python]\n-   [Aalto Spatial Analytics course material]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  [Conda]: https://conda.io/docs/\n  [cartopy]: http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/\n  [descartes]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/descartes\n  [fiona]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona\n  [gdal]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL\n  [geoalchemy2]: https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n  [GMT]: https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/\n  [SQLAlchemy]: http://sqlalchemy.org \n  [geopandas]: http://geopandas.org/\n  [jupyter]: https://jupyter.org/\n  [pandas]: http://pandas.pydata.org \n  [networkx]: https://networkx.github.io/\n  [pyproj]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj?\n  [pysal]: https://pysal.org/\n  [osmnx]: https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\n  [rasterio]: https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n  [rasterstats]: http://pythonhosted.org/rasterstats/\n  [rtree]: http://toblerity.org/rtree/\n  [shapely]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely\n  [skimage]: http://scikit-image.org/\n  [scikit-learn]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\n  [snappy]: https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/19300362/How+to+use+the+SNAP+API+from+Python\n  [SNAP]: snap.md\n  [spyder]: https://docs.spyder-ide.org/\n  [Conda environments]: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#\n  [Bioconda]: bioconda.md\n  [Python spatial]: https://github.com/SpatialPython/spatial_python/blob/master/packages.md\n  [Geoprocessing with Python using Open Source GIS]: http://www.gis.usu.edu/%7Echrisg/python/2009/\n  [GeoExamples]: https://geoexamples.com/\n  [Automating GIS processes course materials]: https://automating-gis-processes.github.io\n  [Geohack Week materials]: https://geohackweek.github.io/schedule.html\n  [Multiprocessing Basics]: https://pymotw.com/2/multiprocessing/basics.html\n  [sentinelsat]: https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\n  [CSC Python parallelisation examples]: https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/puhti\n  [Geographic Data Science with Python]: https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html\n  [Aalto Spatial Analytics course material]: https://spatial-analytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/course-info.html\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
