We can now test the application to see if it works:\n\n    ```bash\n    mcl --version\n    ```\n\n12. If everything works we can clean up:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ..\n    rm -rf mcl-*\n    ```\n\n13. We can also add a `runscript`:\n\n    ```bash\n    echo 'exec /bin/bash \"$@\"' >> /apptainer\n    ```\n\n14. We can now exit the container:\n\n    ```bash\n    exit\n    ```\n\n15. We can then build a production image from the sandbox:\n\n    ```bash\n    apptainer build --fakeroot mcl.sif mcl\n    ```\n\n16. We can now test it:\n\n    ```bash\n    apptainer exec mcl.sif mcl --version\n    ```\n\n## Definition file\n\nðŸ’¬ The above method is fine if you intend the container to be only used by you\nand your close collaborators. However, if you plan to distribute it wider, it's\nbest to write a definition file for it. That way the other users can see what\nis in the container, and they can, if they so choose, easily rebuild the\nproduction image.\n\nðŸ’¡ A definition file will also make it easier to modify and reuse the container\nlater. For example, software updates can often be done simply by modifying the\nversion number in the definition file and rebuilding the image.\n\n1. To write the definition file, we can start from the original bare-bones file\nand add various sections to it as required. The installation commands go into\nthe `%post` section:\n\n   ```text\n   %post\n       yum group install \"Development Tools\" -y\n       yum install wget -y\n       wget https://micans.org/mcl/src/mcl-latest.tar.gz\n       tar xf mcl-latest.tar.gz\n       cd mcl-14-137\n       ./configure\n       make\n       make install\n   ```\n\n2. If you need to set any environment variables, they go into the\n   `%environment` section. If you need to include any files in the container,\n   they go into `%files`. The `runscript` goes to `%runscript`.\n3. There are also other sections available if needed. More information can be\n   found in the [Definition Files chapter](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/definition_files.html)\n   of the Apptainer documentation.\n4. The final definition file would look like this:\n\n   ```text\n   Bootstrap: yum\n   OSVersion: 7\n   MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/\n   Include: yum\n   \n   %post\n       yum group install \"Development Tools\" -y\n       yum install wget -y\n       wget https://micans.org/mcl/src/mcl-latest.tar.gz\n       tar xf mcl-latest.tar.gz\n       cd mcl-14-137\n       ./configure\n       make\n       make install\n       cd ..\n       rm -rf mcl-*\n   \n   %environment\n       export LC_ALL=C\n   \n   %runscript\n       exec /bin/bash \"$@\"\n   ```\n\n5. You can now build the image:\n\n   ```bash\n   apptainer build --fakeroot mcl.sif mcl.def\n   ```\n\n6. In more complex cases, it often helpful to first build the image in the\n   sandbox mode and make note of all the commands needed. You can then write a\n   definition file to replicate the necessary steps.\n\n## More information\n\nðŸ’¡ Docs CSC: [Creating containers](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/creating/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
