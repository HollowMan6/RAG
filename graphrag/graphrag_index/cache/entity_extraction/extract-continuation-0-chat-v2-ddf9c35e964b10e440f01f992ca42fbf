In these cases, you should open Allas connection \nwith command:\n```text\nallas-conf -k \n```\nThe above command should be executed in the shell session that you intend to use to launch your batch job.\nIn the command, the option `-k` indicates that the password, entered for _allas-conf_, will be \nstored in the environment variable `$OS_PASSWORD`. With this variable defined, you no longer need to \ndefine the password when you re-execute _allas-conf_ with the _-k_ option and the Allas project name. \nYou can define the project name either explicitly:\n```text  \nallas-conf -k project_2012345\n```\nOr use the $OS_PROJECT_NAME variable that was assigned when the connection was first opened:\n```text\nallas-conf -k $OS_PROJECT_NAME\n```\nThe two commands above now set up the Allas connection for eight hours without prompting the user.\n\nNote that if you mistype your password when using the _-k_ option, you must use  `unset` command to reset the *OS_PASSWORD* variable before \nyou can try again:\n```text\nunset OS_PASSWORD\n```\nTo be able to use the automatized connection creation in batch jobs, you need to add the option `-f` to the \ncommand, to skip certain internal checks that are not compatible with batch jobs. \nFurther, _allas-conf_ is just an alias of a _source_ command that reads the Allas configuration script `allas_conf`.\nThis aliased command is not available in batch jobs, so instead of _allas-conf_, you must use the command:\n\nPuhti:\n```text\nsource /appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -f -k $OS_PROJECT_NAME\n```\nMahti:\n```text\nsource /appl/opt/csc-tools/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -f -k $OS_PROJECT_NAME\n```\n\nThus after opening an Allas connection with the commands\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf -k\n```\nYou can add the above mentioned source commands to your batch job script to make sure that the Allas connection is valid when needed. \n\nIn *a-commands* (_a-put_, _a-get_, _a-list_, _a-delete_), this feature is included, so you do not need to add the \nconfiguration commands to the batch job script, but you must still remember to run `allas-conf -k` before \nsubmitting the job:\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf -k\nsbatch my_long_job.sh\n```\nWhere the _my_long_job.sh_ could look like:\n\n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=my_allas_job\n#SBATCH --account=project_2012345\n#SBATCH --time=48:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --output=allas_output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=allas_errors_%j.txt\n\n#download data\na-get 178-data-bucket/dataset34/data2.txt.zst\n\n#do the analysis\nmy_analysis_command -in dataset34/data2.txt   -outdir results34\n\n#upload results\na-put -b 178-data-bucket results34\n```\n\nIf you use _rclone_ or _swift_ instead of the a-commands, you need to add the _source_ commands to your script. In this case, \nthe batch job script for Puhti could look like:\n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=my_allas_job\n#SBATCH --account=project_2012345\n#SBATCH --time=48:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --output=allas_output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=allas_errors_%j.txt\n\n#make sure connection to Allas is open\nsource /appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -f -k $OS_PROJECT_NAME\n\n#download input data\nrclone copy allas:178-data-bucket/dataset34/data2.txt ./\n\n#do the actual analysis\nmy_analysis_command -in dataset34/data2.txt   -outdir results34\n\n#make sure connection to Allas is open\nsource /appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -f -k $OS_PROJECT_NAME\n\n#upload results to allas\nrclone copyto results34 allas:178-data-bucket/\n```\nFor Mahti, remember to source `/appl/opt/csc-tools/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf` instead of `/appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf` in all places where you need to make sure the connection is open.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a data management system used for handling batch jobs and interactive usage, providing tools and commands for data storage and retrieval)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>EVENT<|>A command within the Allas data management system to open a connection valid for eight hours, with options for batch job compatibility)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OS_PASSWORD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment variable used to store the password for Allas connection in a user's session)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OS_PROJECT_NAME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment variable used to store the Allas project name for connection purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing environment where Allas data management system commands are executed for batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another computing environment where Allas data management system commands are executed for batch jobs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>ALLAS<|>Allas-conf is a command used to manage connections within the Allas data management system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS_PASSWORD<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>OS_PASSWORD is used in conjunction with allas-conf command to store the connection password<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS_PROJECT_NAME<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>OS_PROJECT_NAME is used with allas-conf to specify the project name for the connection<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Puhti is one of the computing environments where Allas is used for data management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Mahti is another computing environment where Allas commands are executed for data management<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
