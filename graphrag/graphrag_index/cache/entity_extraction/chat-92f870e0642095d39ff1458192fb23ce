Choose the one that is more convenient for you, all your identities should be linked to the same Rahti 1 account.\n\n#### Command line login\n\nIn order to get the \"login command\", once you have logged in the web interface, click on your name and then in \"Copy Login Command\". For security reasons, you will be required to login again, after that you will be served the page the login command you can copy to the clipboard and paste it in any terminal running on your system.\n\n![Copy Login Command](../img/CopyLoginCommand.png)\n\n### How to create a project?\n\nThere are few places in th web interface where a project can be created. One of the paths to create a project is to go to `Administrator` > `Home` > `Projects`\n\n![page1](../img/create_project1.png)\n\nThen click in \"Create Project\".\n\n![page1](../img/create_project2.png)\n\nThe fields are the same as with Rahti 1 had:\n\n1. You need to pick a unique name that is not in use by any other project in the system.\n    \n1. You can also enter a human-readable display name and.\n    \n1. You have to also enter a CSC computing project in the Description field. It must be a currently valid CSC project, that your account has access to. In order to view to which CSC projects you have access to, please check https://my.csc.fi. If you have access to no CSC project, you will not be able to create any Rahti 1 project. If you have Rahti 1 access via project_1000123, you would enter the following in the Description field:\n\n> csc_project: 1000123\n\n### How to see quota/limits?\n\nThe quota and limits of a given project can be found in the bottom of the project details page.\n\n![Project page](../img/project_page.png)\n\nIf you click in \"quota\"\n\n![Quota details](../img/quota_details.png)\n\n### What are the default limits?\n\nEvery Pod needs to have lower and upper limits regarding resources, specifically for CPU and memory. The lower are called requests, and the upper are called limits. The requests sets the minimum resources needed for a Pod to run, and a Pod is not allowed to use more resources than the specified in limits. The user can set the limits explicitly within the available quota.\n\nIn Rahti 1 the default limits were the same as the default quota:\n\n```yaml\n      resources:\n        limits:\n          cpu: '2'\n          memory: 8Gi\n        requests:\n          cpu: 50m\n          memory: 200Mi\n```\n\nIn Rahti 2 the default limits are lower than the default quota:\n\n```yaml\n    - resources:\n        limits:\n          cpu: 500m\n          memory: 1Gi\n        requests:\n          cpu: 50m\n          memory: 500Mi\n```\n\nThe recommended way to discover the suitable values for your application is trial and error. Launch your application in Rahti 2 and observe the memory and CPU consumption. If your application gets to the memory limit, it will be killed with an `OutOfMemoryError` (`OOM`), normally with a `137 error code`. CPU on the other hand, behaves differently, and the application will not be killed. But both limits have to be treated on the same way, if you see that any of the two limits is reached, raise the limit and try again. It is recommended to have at least a small margin of 10-20% over the expected limits. Of course, you can skip this process if you already know your application's resource needs. Also you might take a look to the [Horizontal Autoscaler](../../tutorials/addHorizontalAutoscaler/), which allows you to automatically create and delete replicas of your Pods. It is better for availability and resource scheduling to have several smaller Pods, but not all applications support it.  \n\n!!! info \"Why are limits tighter?\"\n    Rahti 1 resource range (difference between request and limits) was too wide. This made the scheduler's job harder, as every Pod looked the same regarding resource needs (every Pod requested the same resources). This increased the \"noisy neighbours effect\", were Pods hungry for resources were placed on the same nodes as more modest Pods. The hungry ones were starving the more modest ones. With tighter limits and a maximum factor of between request and limit, Pods will need to be configured with more explicit limits.\n\n### How to edit a Deployment/DeploymentConfig default limits?\n\n![Actions>EditResourceLimits](../img/editResourceLimits.png){ align=right }\n\nIn order to increase or decrease the resource limits, one can use the web UI or the command line.\n\nFrom the web UI, go to the Deployment page, go to **Actions > Edit resource limits**. You will be presented with a dialog with the CPU request and limit and Memory request and limit. The limit cannot be more than 5 times higher than the request. The request is the minimum CPU (or memory) necessary for the deploy to work, and will be used to schedule the Pod. The limit is the maximum allowed usage of CPU (or memory). If a Pod tries to use more memory than the limit, the Pod will be killed (OOMKilled). On the other hand, if a Pod tries to use more CPU then the limit, it will be simply limited, but it will not be killed.\n\n![Edit ResourceLimits](../img/editResourceLimitsDialog.png)\n\n!!!
