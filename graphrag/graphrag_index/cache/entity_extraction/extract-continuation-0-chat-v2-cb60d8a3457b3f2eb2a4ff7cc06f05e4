In interactive batch\njobs you can run small tasks that use just one computing core. Thus, you should add\ndefinition `-c 1` to the `ipyrad` command:\n\n```bash\nipyrad -p params-run1.txt -s 1234567 -c 1\n```\n\n## Running heavy iPyrad jobs in Puhti\n\nIf you are analyzing large datasets, it is recommended that you run the iPyrad process is several phases. Some steps of the iPyrad analysis can utilize parallel computing. To speed up the processing, you could run these analysis steps as normal batch jobs.\n\nThe first two steps are typically executed rather quickly, and you can run them in an interactive batch job environment (see above). \nFor example, in the case of job `run1`:\n\n```bash\nipyrad -p params-run1.txt -s 12 -c 1\n```\n\nThe third step of the iPyrad analysis runs a clustering for each sample set. Before starting this step, study first the content of the `jobname_edits` directory created by step 2. To check how many samples will be analyzed, you can, for example, count the rows in the file `s2_rawedit_stats.txt`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\ncd run1_edits\nls -l\nwc -l s2_rawedit_stats.txt\n```\n\nThe number of samples is the maximum number of parallel processes you should use in the parallel batch jobs. In practice, you should use a value that is about half of the number of samples. For example, if you have 24 samples in the `*_edits` directory, then you could consider using 12-16 cores.\n\nThe parallelization implementation of iPyrad requires that you always have only one iPyrad \"task\" running in one node. This means that you should always have the batch job parameter `--ntasks-per-node=1`. However, you can define that this task uses several cores with `--cpus-per-task`. For example, if you would assign the number of batch job tasks to 2 (`--ntasks=2`) and number of cores used by one task to 8 (`--cpus-per-task=8`), your job would use 2 * 8 = 16 cores. \n\nThis number of cores (`--ntasks` * `--cpus-per-task`) is then given to the iPyrad command with option `-c`. This is critical, as otherwise iPyrad will only use one core, even if it is requested from Slurm with `--cpus-per-task=8`. Further, if you are using more than one node you should define that MPI is in use (`--MPI`) and that the commands of the pipeline are executed using only one computing core (`-t`).\n\nIn the sample case here, we will use 20 cores in one node. If the run time is expected to be more than 3 days, the job should be submitted to longrun partition (`#SBATCH --partition=longrun`). In this case, we reserve 72 hours (3 days). Further, in step 3, the clustering commands are executed using 20 cores (`-c 20`), each running one thread (`-t 1`).\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=ipyrad_s3\n#SBATCH --error=ipyrad_err_%j\n#SBATCH --output=put=ipyrad_output_%j\n#SBATCH --mem=128G\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=72:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=20\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nmodule load ipyrad\nipyrad -p params-run1.txt -s 3 -c 20 -t 1 \n```\n\nThe batch job is launched with command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch ipyrad_batch_job_file.sh\n```\n\nOnce the job has finished, you could run the next step by replacing `-s 3` with `-s 4` etc.\n\nFor the setups 4\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IPYRAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iPyrad is an interactive toolkit for assembly and analysis of genomic data sets for population genetic and phylogenetic studies, available under GNU GPLv3 license and can be used on Puhti\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a computing environment where iPyrad can be used for genomic data analysis\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU GPLv3<|>EVENT<|>The license under which iPyrad is freely available and open source\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IPYRAD<|>PUHTI<|>iPyrad is specifically designed to be used within the Puhti computing environment for genomic data analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IPYRAD<|>GNU GPLv3<|>iPyrad is available under the GNU GPLv3 license, indicating its open-source and free usage nature<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
