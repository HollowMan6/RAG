It is part of our [Machine learning guide](ml-guide.md).\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn machine learning (ML), one key component in model selection is to select a suitable set of model configurations for solving a given statistical problem. These model configurations are known as *hyperparameters*.\n\nThis is in no way an easy task. Statistical estimation problems assumes that there exists an optimal solution, however in many real-world problems there is no guarantee that such a solution exists. For example, in biological and medical applications the variability of observations makes near impossible to obtain optimal, separable decision boundaries; whereas (the canonical) seabass and salmon sorting does have a more (or less) optimally defined solutions; and in linguistics they maybe statistically optimal solutions, however semantically the results may be incomprehensible to humans. The lack of an optimal solution makes it difficult to give recommendations for setting up hyperparameters in a ML for a given problem. For this reason, this document chooses to use the term **search** instead of **optimization** (as optimization appears more frequently in ML literature). \n\nSome key points when attempting hyperparameter searching:\n\n+ the amount of available data\n+ choice of loss function ( determines the type of estimator to be used )\n+ choice of solver\n\nThese points are conditioned on each other. Hyperparameters can be numerical (discrete or continuous) or categorical (type of regularization, activation functions, solvers), and additionally many hyperparameters (may) have both linear and nonlinear effects on each other. Since ML models are applied to statistical problems, there is no substitute for good statistical knowledge of the problem at hand: this helps setting some possible hyperparameter options and their ranges and choosing the right type of estimator. For example, if all patterns, or almost all, are considered important to the problem at hand, parallel learning methods are preferable (such as neural networks); then if only some patterns are considered important then sequential statistical methods should be preferred. Choosing suitable hyperparameters can be done either manually or automatically. This documentation focuses on automated searching.\n\nIn order to do hyperparameter search, the data is randomly divided into three separate sets: *training*, *validation* and *test* sets ( given that there is enough data. Otherwise, the validation set can be omitted ). Hyperparameters are searched using the training data and validated the validation set. Once a suitable set of hyperparameters has been found, the completed model is evaluated against the test set.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind however, is that a change in a hyperparameter defines a new model, *all* hyperparameter searches select the best model w.r.t to a given metric (probability of error for example), which is statistically a questionable approach. Training **n** models on the *same* data set induces a dependency, which has to be considered when comparing different models. ANOVA or Bernoulli trials could be considered here when comparing different models on the same data.\n\n## Search strategies\n\nThere are five main categories of searching for hyperparameters.\n\n### Grid search\n\nIn *Grid search*, the hyperparameters of a model are considered occupying a grid. Each grid point corresponds to a set of hyperparameters, and then the grid is searched and evaluated w.r.t given metric. This approach is more suitable when the number of hyperparameters is low and their ranges is limited. This is because Grid search does an exhaustive search from the entire search space, which can be time consuming with a large search space. So Grid Search would be more appropriate if you are searching for a small number of hyperparameters, or for suitable categorical hyperparameters, such as type of regularizer and type of solver. Grid search approach is easily parallelizable.\n\n\n### Randomized search\n\n*Randomized search* allows searching for hyperparameters from a larger search space. Given a set of hyperparameters and their lower and upper bounds, values are randomly selected from the given ranges. In theory, given a large search space, Random search will be able to find more suitable set of hyperparameters. Similarly as Grid search, Random search is also easily parallelizable. \n\n\n### Adaptive search\n\nGrid and Random search approaches do not take into account the previously evaluated hyperparameter candidates, whereas *adaptive search*, or *Bayesian optimization*, utilizes previously evaluated hyperparameters to direct its search for a new set of hyperparameters. The search is done by training a *surrogate model*, which contains a set of initial hyperparameters. After a surrogate model has been trained, an *acquisition function* is used to direct the search for new hyperparameters. This approach is sequential in nature: the search moves forward only after the set of hyperparameters have been evaluated by the acquisition function, making adaptive search difficult to parallelize.\n\n\n### Multifidelity search\n\n*Multifidelity search* addresses the problem of searching large hyperparameter spaces, particularly for large neural network models. The search is divided into *low* and *high* fidelity evaluations: low fidelity involves a small subset of the training data while high fidelity involves a large subset of the training data. The performances of each hyperparameter configuration from low and high fidelity evaluations are recorded and those which performed best are selected to the next evaluation. There are two popular multifidelity approaches: *successive halving* and *hyperband*. In successive halving, each evaluation iteration discards half of the \"poorest performing\" hyperparameter configurations which have a static budget, and keeps the better half of the hyperparameter configurations. This process in continued until the best set of hyperparameters remain. Hyperband addresses the static nature of successive halving by dynamically allocating the amount budget to hyperparameters during iterations, using successive halving as a subroutine for selecting the suitable hyperparameters.\n\n\n### Metaheuristics\n\n*Metaheuristics* are a set of search methods that can cope with difficult\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides supercomputers for machine learning hyperparameter search as part of their Machine Learning Guide)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRID SEARCH<|>EVENT<|>A hyperparameter search strategy that considers hyperparameters occupying a grid, suitable for a small number of hyperparameters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANDOMIZED SEARCH<|>EVENT<|>A hyperparameter search strategy that selects values randomly from a given range, suitable for a larger search space)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAPTIVE SEARCH<|>EVENT<|>Also known as Bayesian optimization, it uses previously evaluated hyperparameters to direct the search for new ones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTIFIDELITY SEARCH<|>EVENT<|>A search strategy that divides evaluations into low and high fidelity to efficiently search large hyperparameter spaces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUCCESSIVE HALVING<|>EVENT<|>A multifidelity search approach that discards half of the poorer performing configurations at each iteration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERBAND<|>EVENT<|>A multifidelity search approach that dynamically allocates budget to hyperparameters during iterations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTIFIDELITY SEARCH<|>SUCCESSIVE HALVING<|>Successive halving is a specific approach used within multifidelity search strategies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTIFIDELITY SEARCH<|>HYPERBAND<|>Hyperband is a specific approach used within multifidelity search strategies, enhancing the successive halving method<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
