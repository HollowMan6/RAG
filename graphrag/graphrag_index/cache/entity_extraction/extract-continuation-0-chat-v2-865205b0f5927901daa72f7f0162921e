It is part of our [Machine learning\nguide](ml-guide.md).\n\nInstead of providing a single integrated machine learning workflow\nsystem, our approach is to support a wide range of ML workflow tools\nso that users can pick and choose what fits their needs best.\n\n## MLflow\n\n[MLflow][MLflow] is an open source tool for tracking experiments and\nmodels in machine learning projects. It is included in most of [our\npre-installed modules for machine learning][ml-apps], such as\n`pytorch`, `tensorflow` and `python-data`. You can also easily install\nMLflow yourself with `pip` (see [our documentation on how to install\nPython packages][own-install]).\n\nWe document **two ways to use MLflow on CSC's supercomputers**:\n\n1. Storing the tracking data on the supercomputer's filesystem (e.g.,\n   on `/scratch/`) and viewing the results via the [MLflow tracking\n   UI](#mlflow-tracking-ui) in the web interface. (This is currently\n   only supported on Puhti.)\n   \n2. Using your own [MLflow tracking server](#mlflow-tracking-server),\n   for example running on [CSC's Rahti\n   service](../../cloud/rahti/index.md).\n   \nOption 1 is simpler to get started with - just add a few lines in\nyour code and open the MLflow UI in the web interface - however it may\nnot scale up very well to hundreds of runs or multiple users. For more\nadvanced use cases we recommend Option 2.\n\nFirst we'll explain how to modify your code to enable MLflow tracking.\n\n\n### Tracking runs\n\nEnabling MLflow tracking in your Python code is easy. Some libraries\nsupport [automatic logging with MLflow][autolog], but even if the\nlibrary you are using does not, logging can be added with just a few\nlines of code. For example:\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"/scratch/project_2001234/mlruns\")\nmlflow.start_run(run_name=os.getenv(\"SLURM_JOB_ID\"))\n```\n\nWith `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` we set the location where the MLflow\nfiles should be stored, replace with the appropriate path for your own\nproject in the example. If you don't set a location it will create a\ndirectory called `mlruns` in you current working directory.\n\nInstead of a directory, you can also use an SQLite database, just\nstart the tracking location with `sqlite://`, for example:\n\n```python\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"sqlite:////scratch/project_2001234/mlruns.db\")\n```\n\nInstead of setting the tracking URI in the Python code, you can also\nset it using an environment variable, for example in the Slurm job\nscript:\n\n```bash\nexport MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=/scratch/project_2001234/mlruns\n```\n\nIt is not mandatory to set a name for the run, but in the example\nabove we show how to use the Slurm job id for the name.\n\nFinally in the code where you calculate metrics that you wish to track\nyou need to add a line to track it with MLflow:\n\n```python\nmlflow.log_metric(\"loss\", loss)\n```\n\nFor a full example for PyTorch see [mnist_ddp_mlflow.py][pytorch-ex]\nor [mnist_lightning_ddp.py][lightning-ex] for PyTorch Lightning.\n\nIn addition to metrics you can also log parameters and artifacts. See\nthe [MLflow documentation for a list of logging functions][log-func].\n\n### MLflow tracking UI\n\nTo visualize and monitor your runs you can start the [MLflow tracking\nUI][mlflow-app] using the [Puhti web user interface][webui].\n\nTo launch it, log in to the web interface at\n<https://www.puhti.csc.fi/> and select \"MLflow\" from the \"Apps\"\nmenu. In the submission form you need to select where the MLflow files\nare stored. This is the same path that you used for the\n`mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` method, i.e., typically:\n\n- a directory like `/scratch/<project>/mlruns/`, or\n- an SQLite database like `sqlite:////scratch/<project>/mlruns.db`\n\nThe default resource settings should be fine for most cases.\n\nOnce the session has started you should see a list of your runs similar to this screenshot:\n\n![MLflow front page with list of runs](../../img/mlflow-front.png)\n\nIf you select a run (here named based on the Slurm id), you can for\nexample click on the \"Metrics\" field and select \"loss\" to see a plot\nof that metric over time:\n\n![MLflow plot showing the loss metric over time](../../img/mlflow-metrics.png)\n\n\n### MLflow tracking server\n\nFor more advanced use cases you may want to use an [MLflow remote\ntracking server][tracking-server]. For this the tracking UI in the\nPuhti web interface is not suitable, as it cannot be accessed over the\nnetwork, and it would typically not be running all the time when you\nneed to store data to it.\n\nA more suitable platform for running an MLflow tracking server is\nCSC's Rahti service.  We have provided a ready-made MLflow template in\nRahti's service catalog which makes starting an MLflow tracking server\neasy. See our [user guide on how to start your own MLflow tracking\nserver on Rahti][mlflow-rahti].
