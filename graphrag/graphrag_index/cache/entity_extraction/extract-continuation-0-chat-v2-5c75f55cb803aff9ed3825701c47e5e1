The theoretical peak performance is 7,5 petaflops for the CPU nodes and 2,0 petaflops for the GPU nodes, in total 9,5 petaflops. \n\n\nBoth CPU and GPU nodes have two AMD Rome 7H12 CPUs with 64 cores each,\nmaking the total core count about 180 000. The CPUs are based on AMD Zen 2 architecture,\nsupporting the AVX2 vector instruction set, and run at 2.6 GHz base frequency (max boost up to 3.3 GHz).\nThe CPUs support simultaneous multithreading (SMT) where each core can run two\nhardware threads. When SMT is enabled, the total thread count per node is 256\nthreads. \n\nThe CPU nodes are equipped with 256 GB of memory, and no local disks.\n\nThe GPU nodes are equipped with 512 GB of memory and a local 3,8 TB Nvme drive. They also have four Nvidia Ampere A100 GPUs. In a  subset of the nodes the A100 GPUs have been split into multiple smaller GPUs with a fraction of the compute and memory capacity of the A100 GPUs. These are useful for interactive work, courses and for code development.\n\n### NUMA configuration\n\nMahti node has a highly hierarchical structure. There are two sockets in the\nnode, each containing a single CPU and memory DIMMs. All\nthe memory within the node is shared, but memory performance depends on the\ndistance of the core to the memory. In order to provide slightly increased memory performance\nwe run each CPU in NPS4 (NUMA per socket 4) mode that further splits each CPU\ninto 4 NUMA domains. Each NUMA domain has 16 cores, and two memory controllers with 32 GiB of memory in total. Core 0 runs threads 0 and 128, core 1 threads 1 and 129 and so on. The figure below shows how the threads are distributed over each of the cores and NUMA nodes.\n\n![\"NUMA configuration\"](../img/mahti_numa.png)\n\n### Cores, core complexes and compute dies\n\nThe basic building block of the processor is a core, which are then grouped\ninto core complexes (CCXs), and furthermore into compute dies (CCDs).\n\nEach core has 32 KiB of L1 data cache and 32\nKiB of L1 instruction cache, the L2 cache is also private per core and each\ncore has 512 KiB L2 cache. Each core has two FMA (fused multiply add) units,\nthat operate on full 256 bit vectors, meaning operations in 8 single precision\nfloats or 4 double precision floats can be carried out by each unit each clock\ncycle. Thus, at best 2 (multiply+add) x 2 (two units) x 4 (vector width) = 16\ndouble precision floating point operations per cycle.\n\nMoving up from the core, 4 cores are grouped together into a core\ncomplex (CCX), within the CCX the cores share the same 16 MiB of L3 cache. Two\nof these CCX parts are then combined to form a compute die (CCD).\n\n![\"CCD configuration\"](../img/mahti_ccd.png)\n\nEach processor consists of 8 compute dies and an additional I/O die that houses the memory controllers and PCI-e controller. Each node is then made up of two of these processors and one 200gbit HDR network adapter.\n\n![\"Node configuration\"](../img/mahti_node.png)\n\nFor an in depth description of the Zen 2 core you can read further on it at\n[WikiChip](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/microarchitectures/zen_2)\n\n## Network\n\nThe interconnect is based on Mellanox HDR InfiniBand and each node is connected to the network with a single 200 Gbps HDR link. The network topology is a dragonfly+ topology. The topology consists of multiple groups of nodes, each of which is internally connected with a fat tree topology, these fat trees are then connected to each other using all to all links.\n\n![\"Simplified dragonfly+ toppology\"](../img/mahti_df_ex.png)\n\nIn Mahti there are 234 nodes in each dragonfly group and the internal fat tree has a blocking factor of 1.7:1, with 20 or 18 nodes connected per leaf switch and each leaf switch has 12 links going to the spine switch in the group, all links are 200 Gbps links. There are in total 6 groups, and between the groups there is fully non-blocking all-to-all connectivity, with 5 200 Gbps links going from each spine switch to one spine switch in every other group.\n\n![\"Mahti dragonfly+ toppology\"](../img/mahti_df.png)\n\n## Storage\n\nMahti has a 8.7 PB Lustre parallel storage system providing space for\n[home](disk.md#home-directory), [project](disk.md#projappl-directory) and\n[scratch](disk.md#scratch-directory) storages.\n\nCurrent Lustre configuration for Mahti is:\n\n| Storage area | # OSTs | # MDTs |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| home         |    8   |   1    |\n| projappl     |    8   |   1    |\n| scratch      |   24   |   2    |\n\nPlease see [Lustre documentation](lustre.md) for the terminology.\n\nThe `scratch`\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a supercomputer with a total of 1404 CPU nodes and 24 GPU nodes, offering a theoretical peak performance of 9,5 petaflops.
