This is achieved\nthrough the submission of jobs by the user. A job describes the computing\nresources required to run application(s) and how to run it. LUMI uses\n[Slurm][slurm] as job scheduler and resource manager.\n\nTo run jobs, you need a [project allocation][accesslumi]. You need to\nspecify your project ID in your job script (or via the command line when\nsubmitting your job) in order for your job to be accepted by the job scheduler.\n\n!!! info\n\n    You can use the `lumi-allocations` command to list the projects of which you\n    are a member. This command will also list your allocated and used compute \n    and storage [billing units][billing].\n    \n    Alternative is to use the `groups` command: you should see that you are\n    part of a group named `project_xxxxxxxxx`.\n\n## Slurm commands overview\n\nIn the following, you will learn how to submit your job using the [Slurm\nWorkload Manager][slurm]. If you're familiar with Slurm, you probably won't\nlearn much. However, If you aren't acquainted with Slurm, the following will\nintroduce you to the basics. If you would like to play around with Slurm in a\nsandboxed environment before submitting real jobs on LUMI, we highly recommend\nthat you try the interactive [SlurmLearning tutorial][slurmlearning].\n\nThe main commands for using Slurm are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Command   | Description                                                 |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `sbatch`  | Submit a batch script                                       |\n| `srun`    | Run a parallel job(step)                                    |\n| `squeue`  | View information about jobs in the scheduling queue         |\n| `scancel` | Signal or cancel jobs, job arrays or job steps              |\n| `sinfo`   | View information about nodes and partitions                 |\n\n### Creating a batch script\n\nThe most common type of job is a batch job. They are submitted to the\nscheduler using a batch job script and the `sbatch` command.\n\nA batch job script is a text file containing information about the job\nto be run: the amount of computing resource and the tasks that must be executed.\n\nA batch script is summarized by the following steps:\n\n- the interpreter to use for the execution of the script: bash, python, ...\n- directives that define the job options: resources, run time, ...\n- setting up the environment: prepare input, environment variables, ...\n- run the application(s)\n\nAs an example, let's look at this batch job script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=exampleJob\n#SBATCH --account=myAmazingProject\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --mem=2G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nmodule load MyApp/1.2.3\n\nsrun myapp -i input -o output\n```\n\nIn the previous example, the first line `#!/bin/bash` specifies that the script\nshould be interpreted as a bash script.\n\nThe lines starting with `#SBATCH` are directives for the workload manager.\nThese have the general syntax\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH option_name=argument\n```\n\nNow that we have introduced this syntax, we can go through the directives one\nby one. The first directive is\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=exampleJob\n```\n\nwhich sets the name of the job. It can be used to identify a job in the queue\nand other listings. The second directive sets the billing project for the job\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --account=myAmazingProject\n```\n\n!!! error \"Specify the account\"\n\n    The account option is mandatory. Failing to set it will cause the following\n    error:\n\n    ```\n    Unable to allocate resources: Job violates accounting/QOS policy \n    (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)\n    ```\n\nThe remaining lines specify the resources needed for the job. The first one is\nthe **maximum** time your job can run. If your job exceeds the time limit, it\nis terminated regardless of whether it has finished or not.\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n```\n\nThe time format is ``hh:mm:ss`` (or `d-hh:mm:ss` where `d` is the number of\ndays). Therefore, in our example, the time limit is 2 hours.\n\nThe next four lines of the script describe the computing resources that the job\nwill need to run\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --mem=2G\n```\n\nIn this instance, we request one task (process) to be run on one node. A task\ncorresponds to a process (or an MPI rank). One CPU thread (used, for example,\nwith OpenMP) is requested for the one task as well as 2 GiB of memory should be\nallocated to the whole\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
