These \natomic operations are executed close to the memory in the L2 cache.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/mi250x-gcd.svg\" \n    width=\"800\"\n    alt=\"MI250x Graphics Compute Die (GCD)\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Overview of MI250x Graphics Compute Die (GCD)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWhen a kernel is dispatched for execution on the GPU, it is in the form of a\ngrid of thread blocks. This grid, as well as the thread blocks themselves, can\nbe one, two, or three-dimensional. The size of the grid or block is determined\nby the programmer, but there are limits on the size.\n\n- **Grid**: the number of blocks that can be specified along each dimension is\n  (2147483647, 2147483647, 2147483647)\n- **Block**: the maximum number of threads for each dimension is \n  (1024, 1024, 1024) with an upper thread block size limit of 1024, i.e.,\n  `size.x * size.y * size.z <= 1024`.\n\n!!! note \"About terminology\"\n    \n    AMD occasionally refers to thread blocks as workgroups, and to threads as\n    work-items. However, the terms thread and thread block are more commonly \n    used, as they are more familiar to CUDA programmers.\n\nThe thread blocks are assigned to one of the 110 compute units (CUs) and are\nscheduled in groups of 64 threads known as wavefronts. This is comparable to a\nwarp on NVIDIA hardware, with the primary distinction being that a warp consists\nof 32 threads, while a wavefront comprises 64 threads.\n\nThe figure below presents a schematic view of a MI250x compute unit.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../assets/images/mi250x-compute-unit.svg\" \n    width=\"800\"\n    alt=\"MI250x Compute Unit (CU)\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Overview of a LUMI-G compute node</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe way the wavefronts are executed by a compute unit is the following:\n\n- a wavefront consisting of 64 work-items is assigned to one of the 16-wide\n  SIMD units\n- the majority of the instructions execute in a single cycle, with one instruction\n  necessitating four cycles per wavefront\n- as there are four SIMD units per compute unit, allowing four wavefronts to be\n  executed concurrently, the throughput remains constant at one instruction per\n  wavefront per compute unit\n\nThe compute units have 512 64-wide 4 bytes Vector General Purpose Registers\n(VGPRs).  In addition to these registers, the unit also provides access to low\nlatency storage through a 64 kB Local Data Share (LDS). This shared memory is\nakin to NVIDIA's \"shared memory\" and is accessible to all threads within a block\n(workgroup). The programmer manages the LDS allocation. Additionally,\neach compute unit has access to 16 kB of L1 cache.\n\nThe vector ALUs are completed by matrix cores optimized to execute Matrix Fused\nMultiply Add (MFMA) instructions. These matrix cores provide significant\nacceleration for Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) computations, which\nare essential for Linear Algebra that plays a key role in most High-Performance\nComputing applications and AI wokloads. Each compute unit contains four matrix\ncores, capable of achieving a throughput of 256 FP64 Flops/cycle/CU.\n\n## Disk storage\n\nThere is no local storage on the compute nodes in LUMI-G.
