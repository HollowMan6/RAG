Check that the file in Puhti indeed has a counterpart in Allas:\n\n```bash\na-check -b <id>_$USER <newfilename>   # replace <id> and <newfilename>\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 7\"}\n8. Locate the files you just uploaded to Allas in the Puhti web interface (search for the bucket name)\n\n### Clean up\n\n1. Delete the local file from Puhti:\n\n```bash\nrm <filename>             # replace <filename>\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Whenever you need your data again, you can download it from Allas\n\nüí≠ If you can't find your file but remember the name, try `a-find`. Use `a-find -h` for help.\n\n## Extra: publish a file to the internet\n\nüí¨ The `a-commands` include basic tools for publishing files to the internet. You might notice that the course slides use one of these! ü§ì\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Note: Using these commands makes your **entire bucket** public! Do not engage if you don't want that to happen. All files that you `a-put` in the bucket later will also be accessible from internet, since the _bucket_ is accessible.\n\n### Option 1: `a-publish`\n\n1. Select a file that has an appropriate content and publish it with the command:\n\n```bash\na-publish -b <id>_$USER <filename>   # replace <id> and <filename>\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. The command outputs a URL (public link). Copy it to your browser or send it to your friends üòé\n\n### Option 2: `a-flip`\n\nüí¨ `a-flip` is meant for files that need to be published only temporarily, for example for a one-time share.\n\n1. Select a file that has an appropriate content and publish it with the command:\n\n```bash\na-flip <filename>         # replace <filename>\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. The command outputs an URL (public link). Copy it to your browser or send it to your friends üòé\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Note: `a-flip` takes just the file name, not the bucket name like many of the previous commands.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
