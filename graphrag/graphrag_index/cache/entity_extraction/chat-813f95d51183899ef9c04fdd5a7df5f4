The program performs reference-guided assembly by\naligning sRNA reads to the known virus reference database (GenBank\ngbvrl) as well as *de novo* assembly using _Velvet_ with automated\nparameter optimization. The assembled contigs are compared to the\nreference virus sequences for virus identification. The contigs were\ntreated as undetermined contigs if they are not hit to any known\nviruses. The siRNA profile of these undetermined contigs are provided as\nguidance to discovery novel viruses which do not show sequence\nsimilarity with known viruses.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nDevelopers state that the software is free to use and open source, but no specific\nlicense is specified.\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 1.7, 1.8\n* Chipster graphical user interface\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use VirusDetect on Puhti, you first need to load `biokit` and `virusdetect` modules.\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\nmodule load virusdetect\n```\n\nAfter that, you can start VirusDetect with the command `virus_detect.pl`.\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nvirus_detect.pl --reference vrl_plant reads.fastq\n```\n\nThe developers of VirusDetect recommend removing ribosomal RNA (rRNA)\nsequences from the input sequences before running VirusDetect. This can\nbe done by aligning the sRNA reads against Silva rRNA database using\nBowtie. On Puhti, the Silva database is available in path:\n\n```bash\n/appl/data/bio/biodb/production/silva/Silva_rRNA_database\n```\n\nThe actual cleaning command could look like:\n\n```bash\nbowtie -v 1 -k 1 --un cleaned_reads.fastq -f -q /appl/data/bio/biodb/production/silva/Silva_rRNA_database reads.fastq sRNA_rRNA_match\n```\n\nIf possible, it is recommended that you use `--host_reference` option\nto filter out the sRNA originating from the host organism. This\nfiltering is done by running a BWA mapping against the genome of the\nhost organism. CSC does not maintain BWA indexes on Puhti,\nbut you can use `chipster_genomes` to retrieve BWA indexes used by the \nChipster service.\n\n```bash\nchipster_genomes bwa\n```\n\nThe command above lists the available indexes and asks you to pick one.\nIf a suitable species is not available, then you need to do indexing for their host\norganism genome before running VirusDetect.\n\nFor example, for _Triticum aestivum_, the required BWA indexes can be\ncreated with the commands:\n\n```bash\nensemblfetch.sh triticum_aestivum\nmv Triticum_aestivum.IWGSC.dna.toplevel.fa triticum_aestivum.fa\nbwa index -p triticum_aestivum triticum_aestivum.fa\n```\n\nNote that generating BWA indexes for plant genomes can take several hours.\n\nOnce you have the BWA index for the host genome available, you can launch the VirusDetect job with the command:\n\n```bash\nvirus_detect.pl --reference vrl_plant --host_reference triticum_aestivum.fa cleaned_reads.fastq\n```\n\nVirusDetect is mainly used for detecting plant viruses (`vrl_plant`), but you can use it for other viruses too. The `--reference` option defines the\nreference virus sequence dataset to be used. The available reference datasets are:\n\n```text\nvrl_algae\nvrl_bacteria\nvrl_fungus\nvrl_invertebrates\nvrl_plants\nvrl_vertebrates\n```\n\nBoth the VirusDetect and BWA indexing tasks often require significant\ncomputing capacity. Because of that, you should use batch jobs for \nrunning VirusDetect jobs. Below is a\nsample batch job file for running VirusDetect with 8 computing cores\nand 8 GB of memory. The maximum running time in the job below is set to\n10 hours.\n \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=VirusDetect\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --account=your_project_name\n#SBATCH --time=10:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --mem=8000\n\nmodule load biokit\nmodule load virusdetect\n\nvirus_detect.pl --thread_num 8 --reference vrl_plants --host_reference triticum_aestivum.fa reads_123.fastq\n```\n\nThe batch job file above can be submitted to the batch job system with the\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file.sh\n```\n\nMore information about running batch jobs on Puhti can be found from the\n[batch job instruction pages](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\nVirusDetect writes the analysis results to a new directory, named after the query dataset `result_<queryfile>`. VirusDetect produces a large number of result files. The most essential files are:\n\n* `blastn.html` Table listing reference viruses that have corresponding virus contigs identified by BLASTN.\n* `blastx.html` Table listing reference viruses that have corresponding virus contigs identified by BLASTX. \n* `<query>.blastn.xls` Table of BLASTN matches to the reference virus database.\n* `<query>.blastx.xls` Table of BLASTX matches to the reference virus\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
