Note\n\n    **Haka** is the identity federation of the Finnish universities, polytechnics and research institutions. Users are able to access federation services using a single user account and password. User identities are provided by the users home organizations.\n    \n    **Virtu** is a convenient and fast single sign-on for browser-enabled systems across organisational boundaries. Virtu is used by Finnish government agencies.\n\n## Getting an account with Haka or Virtu\n\n!!! Note \n    If you are trying to access the [LUMI web interface](https://www.lumi.csc.fi) or [LUMI-O](https://www.auth.lumidata.eu),\n    please see the [LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/accessLUMI/) on how to get an account.\n\nIf your home organization is a member of the Haka or Virtu federation, you\ncan create an account yourself.\n\n1. Go to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).\n1. Click _Log in_ or _Getting started_.\n1. Click _Virtu_ or _Haka_ depending on which federation your home\norganization is a member of.\n1. Select your home organization and log in to their identity service.\n1. Fill in your information on the _Sign up_ page.\n1. Set your password using 12 characters or more, containing both upper\nand lowercase letters and at least one number. No special characters are\nallowed.\n1. You will receive your CSC user account information via email.\n\n## Getting an account without Haka or Virtu\n\nThe preferred registration method is to log in using Haka or Virtu. If you do not have this option available, please ask your project manager to [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\nThis mostly applies to foreign collaborators of Finland-based research\ngroups, but ask your project manager to contact CSC and provide details about your use case and we will check your eligibility.\n\n!!! Note\n\n    If you cannot use Haka or Virtu, and do not have a project to\n    join, you can get an account if your home organization has a\n    contract with CSC or you have been granted resources in a\n    program. Contact servicedesk@csc.fi and provide details\n    about your use case, and we will check your eligibility.\n\n## User accounts for courses\n\n### For participants\n\nIf you are attending a course which is utilising CSC's services you need to create your own CSC user account with Haka or Virtu if you don't yet have one. Please see instructions above. \n\n### For organisers/teachers\n\nCSC does not provide temporary training specific user accounts for courses anymore. If the participant does not yet have a user account, it needs to be created. The course organiser can then invite participants to the course project. If you're not able to create CSC user accounts, please [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\nPlease read carefully our guidance if you wish to have a course for your students using CSC's services. We request that you will create the project well in advance as soon as you have the list of the participants. And when the project is ready you are able to start sending out the invitations to your participants. \n\nPlease see instructions on [how to create the course project](how-to-create-new-project.md#course)\n\n\n## Getting a machine-to-machine robot account\n\nIf you are a registered CSC user and need another account for managing\nservices that you run in the CSC services, we can create a\nmachine-to-machine robot account for you. Please note that each service requires it's own unique robot account. Send the following\ninformation to servicedesk@csc.fi.\n\n* Project identifier (e.g. 2001679, uef4713) of the project your\n  service uses\n* The CSC service your service uses (e.g. cPouta, Rahti)\n* Your mobile number (to which the password are sent via SMS)\n\n## Expiration of user accounts\n\nIf you have been granted an account for a fixed period, the account expires when the period ends. Accounts created with Haka or Virtu do not have an end date, and they remain valid as long as the account's password is changed once a year.\n\nAll accounts are immediately terminated if their owner is not reachable, i.e. emails bounce back.\n\n!!! Note\n\n    If you want to terminate your account please contact <mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi>\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides user accounts for accessing its services, including ordinary accounts and machine-to-machine robot accounts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Haka is the identity federation of Finnish universities, polytechnics, and research institutions, offering single sign-on services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Virtu offers convenient and fast single sign-on for browser-enabled systems across Finnish governmental organizational boundaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer whose web interface and documentation are accessible for account creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MyCSC is the portal for creating and managing CSC user accounts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC Service Desk provides support and eligibility checks for creating CSC user accounts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>HAKA<|>CSC user accounts can be created with Haka federation identity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>VIRTU<|>CSC user accounts can be created with Virtu single sign-on<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>LUMI<|>CSC provides instructions for accessing LUMI supercomputer<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MYCSC<|>MyCSC is used for managing CSC user accounts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>CSC Service Desk assists with inquiries about CSC user accounts<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
