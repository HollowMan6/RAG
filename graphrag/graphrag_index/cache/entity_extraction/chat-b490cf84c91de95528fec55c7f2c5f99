Working in the ``LUMI`` [software stack][softwarestacks]: The ``LUMI``\n   software stack offers a range of libraries and packages mostly installed via\n   [EasyBuild][easybuild]. It is possible to install additional software on top\n   of those stacks using EasyBuild, and use those libraries and tools to\n   compile or develop other software outside the EasyBuild environment.\n\n     Each ``LUMI`` stack corresponds to a particular release of the Cray\n   programming environment. It is possible to use the ``PrgEnv`` modules in\n   this environment. However, EasyBuild requires its own set of modules to\n   integrate with the Cray programming environment and we advise users to use\n   those instead when working in the ``LUMI`` stack: ``cpeCray`` replaces\n   ``PrgEnv-cray``, ``cpeGNU`` replaces ``PrgEnv-gnu``, ``cpeAOCC`` replaces\n   ``PrgEnv-aocc`` and ``cpeAMD`` will replace ``PrgEnv-amd`` when that\n   environment becomes available on the [LUMI-G][lumi-g] partition. These\n   modules also take care of the target architecture modules based on the\n   ``partition`` module that is loaded (which offer a way to do cross-compiling\n   for another section of LUMI than you are working on).\n\n!!! Remark \"Workaround for ``PrgEnv/aocc`` bug in 21.12\"\n    The ``cpeAOCC/21.12`` in ``LUMI/21.12`` contains a workaround for the\n    problems with the ``aocc/3.1.0`` module. Hence, it is possible to use\n    the AOCC compilers bh working in the ``LUMI/21.12`` stack and using\n    ``cpeAOCC/21.12`` rather than loading the ``PrgEnv-aocc`` module.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
