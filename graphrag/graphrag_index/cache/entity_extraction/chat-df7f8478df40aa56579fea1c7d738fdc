We can redirect to basically any URL we want with very complex logics. For this tutorial, we will keep it simple and simply redirect to a different host, but keeping the path of the URL.\n\n## Procedure\n\n1. Deploy an NGINX Image. It is recommended to use `bitnami/nginx`\n\n    ![bitnami/nginx](../img/bitnami-nginx.png)\n\n1. Add a Route with the URL that you want to redirect. If you visit the URL, you should see the \"nginx welcome page\"\n\n    ![route](../img/route-create.png)\n\n1. Add a ConfigMap with a server redirection block. Go to **Resources > Config Maps**, click in **Create Config Map**. The **Name** will be later used as **Source** when mounting the ConfigMap. The **Key** will be the name of the file, and the **Value** the content of the file. \n\n    ```nginx\n    #default.conf\n    server {\n            listen *:8080;\n            server_name test.com;\n            return 301 $scheme://test2.com$request_uri;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In this example, `test.com` is the original URL, and `test2.com`  is the one that the user will be redirected to.\n\n1. Mount the Configmap to the nginx deployment. Navigate to **Applications > Deployments** and click in the nginx deployment. Then go to **Configuration** and finally click in **Add Config Files**\n\n    ![ConfigMap](../img/nginx-configmap.png)\n\n    In this example, the ConfigMap has to be mounted in `/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/server_blocks/`, other images may store the nginx configuration in different folders.\n\n## Add more host domains\n\nIf you need to redirect more than one host domain, you can use the same nginx, you just need to (1) add a new Route with the new host, and (2) add a new server block to the existing ConfigMap. In order for nginx to pick up the new configuration, you can delete the Pod or enter in the pod's terminal and run `nginx -s reload`.\n\n## Conclusion and more\n\nNginx is a powerful web server. You can use it also as a HTTP proxy and load balancer. For more information, please check the documentation at <https://nginx.org/en/docs/>.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
