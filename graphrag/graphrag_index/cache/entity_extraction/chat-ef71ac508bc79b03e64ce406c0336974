In the\nfile browser, you can upload/download files, create new files and directories,\nor open a shell in the current directory. You can also use it to move data\nbetween Allas, LUMI-O, IDA and the supercomputer.\n\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n    Keep the tab with the file browser open while the file transfer is in\n    progress to ensure that it completes successfully. Also note that uploaded\n    files will overwrite existing files with the same name _without prompting_!\n    Currently, the maximum size for individual file uploads is **10 GB**.\n\nClicking on a file will open it in view-only mode. For more options like\nediting, renaming and deleting, use the button with three dots next to the\nfilename. \n\nThe file browser comes with a basic text editor. Some important notes about the\neditor:\n\n- If no changes have been made, the _save_ button is grayed out.\n- There is no _save-as_ feature.\n- The user is not notified if a read-only file is opened using the editor.\n  Accordingly, no changes will be applied to the file.\n\n## Accessing Allas and LUMI-O\n\nThe **[Allas object storage service](../../computing/allas.md)** can also be\naccessed from the web interfaces using the file browser.\n\nTo configure authentication for Allas: \n\n1. Open the _Cloud storage configuration_ app either from the _Pinned Apps_ or\n   the _Tools_ dropdown in the navbar.\n2. Once you open the app, you will be prompted to enter your CSC password at\n   the bottom of the page.\n3. After you have authenticated using your password, you will be able to create \n   both S3 and Swift connections, also known as remotes, to Allas. Each remote\n   is only valid for a single project, but you can create multiple remotes to\n   cover different projects.\n4. The created remotes will be visible in the _Files_ dropdown in the navbar,\n   as well as in the file browser (e.g. `s3allas-project_2001234`).\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    The Swift and S3 protocols are not fully compatible with each other,\n    particularly for files larger than 5 GB. For more details about the\n    differences between the protocols, see\n    [Allas protocols](../../data/Allas/introduction.md#protocols).\n\n**[LUMI-O](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/)** can also be\nused through the file browser.\n\nTo configure authentication for LUMI-O:\n\n1. Open the _Cloud storage configuration_ app either from the _Pinned Apps_ or\n   the _Tools_ dropdown in the navbar.\n2. Select the LUMI-O tab in the _Configure new remotes_ section.\n3. Select the project to create authentication for, as well as whether or not\n   you want s3cmd configuration and a public remote.\n\n!!! warning \"Public LUMI-O remotes\"\n    Files uploaded to the public LUMI-O remotes (e.g. `lumi-462001234-public`)\n    can be accessed by anyone using the URL\n    `https://<project-number>.lumidata.eu/<bucket_name>`. Be careful to not\n    upload private data there.\n\nOnce you've set up a connection to Allas/LUMI-O from a web interface, you can\nuse the file browser to access Allas/LUMI-O in the same way as when accessing\nthe shared file system on the supercomputers.\n\nNote that configured remotes that are not accessible due to, for example,\nexpired authentication or network connection issues, will not be visible in the\n_Files_ dropdown menu.\n\n!!! warning \"Large files\"\n    Uploading large files from your local computer to Allas via the web\n    interfaces is currently not recommended due to technical limitations.\n\nIf you no longer need a configured remote, you can revoke the access token for\nit in the list of remotes, or delete the remote from the configuration. Remotes\nnot configured using the Cloud storage configuration app will also be visible\nand can be deleted, but the access tokens for those can not be revoked.\n![Cloud storage configuration tool remote list](../../img/ood_cloud_storage_conf_table.png)\n\n## Accessing IDA\n\nThe [IDA storage service](../../data/ida/using_ida.md) can also be used from\nthe web interfaces. However, some key features, such as moving data from the\nstaging area to the frozen area, are only possible though the\n[IDA web interface](https://ida.fairdata.fi).\n\nTo use IDA from the Puhti/Mahti web interfaces, it must first be configured for\nuse with Rclone in a login node shell as follows:\n\n```\nmodule load allas\nrclone config\n```\n\nIn the Rclone configuration interface, create a new remote with the following\nsettings:\n\n1. Storage: WebDAV (#45)\n2. URL: <https://ida.fairdata.fi/remote.php/webdav/>\n3. Vendor: Nextcloud (#1)\n4. Username: Your CSC username\n5. Password:\n      1. Login to the [IDA web interface](https://ida.fairdata.fi).\n      2. Go to the settings in the top right corner.\n      3. Go to the _Security_ tab and create a new app password.\n      4.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
