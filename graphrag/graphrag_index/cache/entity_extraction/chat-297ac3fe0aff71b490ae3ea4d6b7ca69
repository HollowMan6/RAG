nodePort: 0\n    port: NNNN\n    protocol: TCP\n    targetPort: NNNN\n```\n\nWhere `XXXX` is the name of the service we filled up in the Route, `YYYY` is the name of the deployment, and `NNNN` is the port the deployment is listening to.\n\n### Test\n\nThe tests should be done in a separate namespace, and there are two approaches:\n\n* Test them individually by:\n\n    ```sh\n    oc create -f pvc.yaml\n    ```\n\n    The command above will create a PVC object in the selected namespace. You should check that it works as expected. You can destroy it by:\n\n    ```sh\n    oc delete pvc/XXXX\n    ```\n\n    where `XXXX` is the name of the volume.\n\n* Or all together in the Helm chart, by copying all the `yaml` files we created into the `templates` folder.\n\n    * We can then install it:\n\n    ```sh\n    helm install test-name example/\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** With `--dry-run` you can preview what helm will deploy without making any change.\n\n    * We can see the status of the installed chart by:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ helm ls\n    NAME     \tNAMESPACE    \tREVISION\tUPDATED                                \tSTATUS  \tCHART        \tAPP VERSION\n    test-name\ttest    \t1       \t2023-01-03 14:59:04.026623633 +0200 EET\tdeployed\texample-0.1.0\t1.16.0\n    ```\n\n    * After making a change in the chart templates we can upgrade it:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ helm upgrade test-name example\n    Release \"test-name\" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!\n    NAME: test-name\n    LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Jan  3 15:54:15 2023\n    NAMESPACE: test\n    STATUS: deployed\n    REVISION: 2\n    TEST SUITE: None\n    ```\n\n    * And finally to destroy it:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ helm uninstall test-name\n    release \"test-name\" uninstalled\n    ```\n\n### Configuration\n\nOne of the powerful aspects of Helm is the possibility to, instead of using hardwired values, parametrize them, or to use provided [built-in](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/) values. By removing hardwired values, we provide easy customization that will allow to use the template in more circumstances and for a longer period of time, for example by changing the template image. A user of the template just needs to worry about the `values.yaml` file and not how these values\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
