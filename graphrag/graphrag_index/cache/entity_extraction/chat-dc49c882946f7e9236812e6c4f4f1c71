Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/installing_hands-on_r.html\n---\n\n# R on Puhti and package installations\n\n> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that:\n  - You have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n  - Your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\nüí¨ A pre-installed R environment is available on Puhti.\n\n1. To check available module versions, run:\n\n    ``` bash\n    module spider r-env\n    ```\n\n2. There are several ways to use R in `r-env` on Puhti:\n   - Interactive jobs on a compute node, using either the R console or RStudio  \n     üí° The easiest way to launch RStudio is to use the Puhti web interface at\n     [www.puhti.csc.fi](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/)\n   - Non-interactive batch jobs\n   - Interactively on the login node, using the R console (**only** for moving\n     data, checking package availability, installing packages)\n\n   For example, to launch the R console in an interactive job, open a shell\n   with `sinteractive` and then\n\n   ``` bash\n   module load r-env\n   start-r\n   ```\n\nüí° See the [r-env documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/) for further\ninstructions on different ways to launch R on Puhti.\n\nüí¨ It is also possible to\n[install R packages yourself](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/#r-package-installations).\n\n‚òùüèª However, check first if what you need is already available in `r-env`. The\nmodule contains more than 1300 R packages! The easiest way to check if a\npackage is available is trying to load it with the command\n`library(packagename)`.\n\n## How to install an R package on Puhti\n\n- Note that your own package installations are:\n  - project specific\n  - R version specific\n  - located in the `/projappl` directory of your project\n\n1. Create a folder for your R packages in `/projappl` (open a login node shell\n   in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/) or log in to Puhti\n   with SSH):\n\n   ``` bash\n   cd /projappl/<project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   mkdir project_rpackages_<rversion>\n   ```\n\n2. Start an R session:\n   1. Launch RStudio in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/)\n   2. ... or launch the R console in an interactive shell session:\n      ```bash\n      sinteractive \n      module load r-env\n      start-r\n      ```\n3. In R, add the folder you created above to the list of directories where R\n   will look for packages:\n\n   ``` r\n   .libPaths(c(\"/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_<rversion>\", .libPaths())) \n   ```\n\n4. Assign `libpath` to point to this directory (not strictly necessary, but can\n   make life easier):\n\n   ``` r\n   libpath <- .libPaths()[1]\n   ```\n\n5. Install the package (again, defining `lib = libpath` to specify the\n   installation location is not strictly necessary, but recommended):\n\n   ``` r\n   install.packages(\"packagename\", lib = libpath)\n   ```\n\n6. For example, you can try installing a package called `beepr` with:\n\n   ``` r\n   install.packages(\"beepr\", lib = libpath)\n   ```\n\n7. Finished! The R package is now ready to be loaded and used. Try loading\n   `beepr` with `library(beepr)`.\n\nüí° The package location is defined only for the current R session! R has to be\nreminded of the location at the start of every R session or script where you\nwant to use the project-specific package by running this command again:\n\n``` r\n.libPaths(c(\"/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_<rversion>\", .libPaths())) \n```\n\nüí° Instead of installing a missing package for your own project, you can ask\nfor a module-wide installation for all users by contacting\n[CSC Service Desk](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi).\n\n## More information\n\nüí° Docs CSC: Read more about using R on Puhti in our\n[r-env documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
