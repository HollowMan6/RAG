   # uses n BLAS threads\nend\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use the MKL backend via [MKL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/MKL.jl) as a linear algebra backend.\nMKL is often faster than OpenBLAS when using multiple threads on Intel CPUs, such as those on Puhti.\nWe can set the MKL thread count as follows.\n\n```bash\nexport MKL_NUM_THREADS=$JULIA_CPU_THREADS\n```\n\nIf we use MKL, we should load it before other linear algebra libraries.\n\n```julia\nusing MKL\nusing LinearAlgebra\n# your code ...\n```\n\nThere are [caveats](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/matrix-multiplication-is-slower-when-multithreading-in-julia/56227/12?u=carstenbauer) for using different numbers than one or all cores of BLAS threads on OpenBLAS and MKL.\n\n\n<!-- TODO: trim and move to application section\n### Distributed\nDistributed has two built-in cluster managers, `LocalManager` for processes that communicate using Localhost and `SSHManager` for processes that communicate via SSH.\nWe can add processes to the same node as the Julia job is started using `LocalManager` and the `SSHManager` to add processes to other nodes.\nTODO: ClusterManagers to add processes via Slurm\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n# Adds 2 processes using LocalManager\naddprocs(2)\n\n# Adds 2 processes to node1 and 3 processes to node2 using SSHManager\naddprocs([(2, \"node1\"), (3, \"node2\")])\n```\n\nWhen adding processes, we can also pass various key values, such as environment variables and options for Julia.\nWe demonstrate them in the examples.\n\nWe can find the node name in the Julia process using the following:\n\n```julia\nlocal_node = first(split(gethostname(), '.'; limit=2))\n```\n\nWe can read the names of the nodes that slurm allocated for a job using `SLURM_JOB_NODELIST` environment variable and expanding it using `scontrol show hostnames <nodelist>` command as follows:\n\n```julia\nnodes = readlines(`scontrol show hostnames $(ENV[\"SLURM_JOB_NODELIST\"])`)\n```\n\nWe can use these nodenames when adding processes using `SSHManager`.\n\n!!! info \"LUMI does not have SSH between compute nodes.\"\n    Currently, LUMI does not have SSH between compute notes.\n    Hence we cannot add processes to other nodes via SSHManager.\n-->\n\n\n<!--\n### Using environments\nJulia manages dependencies of projects using environments.\nAn environment consists of two files, `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml`, which specify dependencies for the environment.\nWe define project metadata, dependencies, and compatibility constraints in the `Project.toml` file.\nAdding or removing packages using the package manager manipulates the `Project.toml` file in the active environment.\nFurthermore, the package manager maintains a full list of dependencies in the `Manifest.toml` file.\nIt creates both of these files if they don't exist.\nLet's consider a Julia project structured as follows.\n\n```text\nproject/\n├── script.jl\n├── Project.toml\n└── Manifest.toml\n```\n\nWe can activate an environment using the `--project` option when starting Julia or use the `Pkg.activate` function in the existing Julia session.\nFor example, we can open the Julia REPL with the project's environment active as follows:\n\n```bash\njulia --project=.\n```\n\nWe can call the `Base.active_project()` function to retrieve a path to the active project, that is, `Project.toml` file.\n\nActivating an environment does not automatically install the packages defined by `Manifest.toml` or `Project.toml`.\nFor that, we need to instantiate the project as follows:\n\n```julia\nimport Pkg\nPkg.activate(\".\")\nPkg.instantiate()\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following one-liner:\n\n```bash\njulia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'\n```\n\nNow, we can run the script using the project's environment as follows:\n\n```bash\njulia --project=. script.jl\n```\n\nJulia will activate the default environment if we don't specify an environment.\nPreferably, we should use a unique environment for Julia projects instead of the default environment.\nThat way, we can manage the dependencies of different Julia projects separately.\n\n\n### Adding packages to an environment\nOn the Julia REPL, we can use the package manager by importing it.\n\n```julia\nimport Pkg\n```\n\nWe can activate a Julia environment on the current working directory as follows.\n\n```julia\nPkg.activate(\".\")\n```\n\nWe can add packages to the active environment using the `Pkg.add` function.\nFor example, we can add the `ArgParse` package as follows.\n\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"ArgParse\")\n```\n-->\n\n\n<!-- TODO: Move this section to end of julia tutorial\n\n### Creating a package with a command line interface\nWe should package the code as a code base grows instead of running standalone scripts.\nA Julia package includes a module file, such as `src/Hello.jl`, and the `Project.toml` file.\nIncluding a command line interface in your program, such as `src/cli.jl`, is also wise.\nLet\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters":
