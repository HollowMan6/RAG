In the same directory, the full build directory can also be found\n   in `/tmp`. Inspecting the output logs from `configure` or `cmake` can sometimes\n   be fruitful.\n\n    Some failures can be avoided by:\n\n    - building a different version of the packages\n    - building with a different compiler (try `%gcc` or `%cce`)\n    - disabling a variant of the package\n    - modifying which dependencies are used to build the target package (see\n      [Specs and\n      Dependencies](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies)\n      in the official Spack documentation)\n\n    In some cases, changes have to be made to the `package.py` file of a package.\n    Unfortunately, this is not straightforward as the package repository is\n    located in `/appl/lumi`, which is read-only. In such cases, you have to either\n    make your own Spack instance and configure it using our configuration\n    files, or set up a custom Spack package repository and override the default Spack settings (see more below).\n\n2. **Seek help:** you can check the \n    [official Spack documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io), open a ticket \n    at the [LUMI Helpdesk](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/) \n    or ask the Spack community via the [Spack Slack](http://spackpm.slack.com), \n    the Spack Slack community can be very helpful.\n\n## Description of the different Spack modules\n\n* Module `spack/23.09`: This is Spack release version 0.21.0 (with some critical bug fixes for concretization backported from the 0.21.1 development branch) based on the Cray Programming Environment 23.09.\n  The ROCM packages are ROCM release version 5.6.1 adapted by the LUMI User Support Team for CPE 23.09.\n  Testing has indicated that it should be possible to run ROCM 5.6.1-based software using the older drivers from ROCM 5.2.3, which is installed on the LUMI-G compute nodes.\n  There are only minor incompatibilities, e.g. the amount of GPU memory might be reported incorrectly.\n* Module `spack/23.03-2`: This is Spack release version 0.20.0 based on the Cray Programming Environment 23.03.\n  The ROCM packages are built from source by Spack and corresponds to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
