Note: SD Connect displays all the data uploaded in Allas using CSC interfaces for non-sensitive data management. \n   \n* List and select your CSC project from the drop-down menu bar (top left corner) to visualize buckets belonging to a specific CSC project;\n\n* Open any bucket (double click) and view its content (uploaded files or folders). Any file can be downloaded or shared using the download link. From this view, you can also download the entire bucket, delete files or upload new files and folders;\n\n* Clicking on _edit_, you can type in and add appropriate tags to describe buckets or files. \n\n\n![SD Connect Image 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/149062070-7541673f-9fc1-445a-a790-80aa5f296e0c.png)\n\n\n![SD Connect image 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/149062085-a149fe12-0d9a-4dd2-87d4-d2e82ca2bbc4.png)\n\n\n### User information page\n\nOn this page, you can:\n\n* in _Currently Consumes_ view statistics about the selected CSC project resource usage: billing unit consumption and the total project storage usage (default storage 10 TiB);\n\n* in _Project usage_, you can view the SD Connect _Project Identifier_, an ID associated with your CSC project. This ID is required when sharing buckets with other CSC projects using the SD Connect user interface. It does not contain sensitive information. Thus, it can be shared with your colleagues or collaborators via email.\n\n* access the _Sharing API tokens_ to generate a temporary token (necessary for data upload programmatically, using Swift client).\n\n\n![SD-Connect-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/124910227-098a3980-dff4-11eb-8029-57af3abc5cf4.png)\n\n\n### Shared page\n\nOn the _Shared_ page:\n\n* clicking on _Shared to the project_, you can view the buckets that other CSC projects (belonging to your colleagues or collaborators) shared with you. Next to the bucket name, under _Bucket Owner_, it displays the ID associated with the CSC project to which the bucket belongs (also called SD Account). With a double click, you can access the bucket and view the content (if you have reading access) or add files to the container (if you have edit rights).\n\n!!! Note\n    All the buckets listed here are owned by other users, which can decide when to revoke your access. You will not be able to access the file from SD Desktop until you make a copy of the bucket.\n\n* clicking on _Shared from the project_, you can view the buckets you shared with other CSC projects. In this case, you own the shared buckets, and you can decide when to revoke access. \n\n![sd-connect-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/122786163-b22e5e80-d2bc-11eb-8c15-7585e656f0f2.png)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
