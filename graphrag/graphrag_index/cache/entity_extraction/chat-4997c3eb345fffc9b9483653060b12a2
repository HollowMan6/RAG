Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 8\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/compiler_options.html\n---\n\n# Compiling using optimizing compiler options\n\n> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that:\n  - You have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n  - Your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\n## Overview\n\nüí≠ Without any optimization options, a compiler tries to reduce the\ncomputational cost of compiling and to make debugging produce the expected\nresults. Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve\nthe performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and\npossibly the ability to debug the program.\n\n‚òùüèª It is recommended to start with safe (basic) optimization, and then move up\nto intermediate, or even aggressive, while ensuring that results produced by\nthe program remain correct and that the performance actually improves.\n\n## Compare different optimization flags\n\nüí¨ This tutorial examines a simple C++ code that computes the Laplacian for a\ntwo-dimensional field. We'll use `gcc` to compile the code with different\noptimization options and observe how they affect performance. Understanding\nthe details of the program is not important for completing this tutorial, just\nconsider it an illustrative example.\n\n1. Create and enter a suitable scratch directory on Puhti (replace `<project>`\n   with your CSC project, e.g. `project_2001234`):\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER/laplacian\n   cd /scratch/<project>/$USER/laplacian\n   ```\n\n   ‚òùüèª Own software should normally be installed under `/projappl`, but for the\n   sake of this exercise it is sufficient to use `/scratch`.\n\n2. Download the source code from Allas:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/laplacian.cpp\n   ```\n\n3. To avoid causing unnecessary load on the login node, launch an interactive\n   session on a compute node:\n\n   ```bash\n   sinteractive --account <project> --time 00:15:00 --tmp 0  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n4. First, compile the code using `gcc` without optimizing compiler options:\n   \n   ```bash\n   gcc -fopenmp -o laplacian laplacian.cpp\n   ```\n\n   - `-o laplacian` instructs the compiler to name the executable output as\n     `laplacian`.\n   - `-fopenmp` flag is needed for this code since it uses OpenMP directives.\n\n5. Run the code as (should take about two minutes):\n\n   ```bash\n   ./laplacian\n   ```\n\n6. Recompile the code using safe (`-O2`), intermediate (`-O3`) and aggressive\n   (`-Ofast`) optimization options. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcc -O2 -fopenmp laplacian.cpp -o laplacian_O2\n   ```\n\n7. Re-run the program for each optimization level.\n   - How much does the performance improve in each case?\n   - Do the results remain the same for all optimization levels?\n\nüí° In this case `-Ofast` increases code size by roughly 10% compared to using\nno optimization flags. Although the absolute difference for such a small code\nis insignificant (only about 2 KB), it is good to keep in mind that\noptimization may affect output program size. Similarly, more aggressive\noptimization typically increases compilation time and may worsen debugging\nexperience.\n\n‚òùüèª Aggressive optimization may result in programs producing less precise or\neven incorrect results. Please be aware of this and thoroughly benchmark your\ncode when using aggressively optimizing compiler flags.\n\nüí° As the example code here is so small, it is not necessary to compile on the\nfast local disk to move I/O load away from the shared file system. However,\nwhen building a larger, more realistic software package, please use `$TMPDIR`\nto avoid stressing Lustre.\n\n## Bonus: Fortran version\n\n1. Re-run the previous steps for a similar program written in Fortran instead\nof C++. You may download the source code from Allas:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/laplacian.F90\n   ```\n\n1. Use `gfortran` compiler instead of `gcc`. The previous options are the same\n   for both compilers.\n\nüí≠ How does the performance and results compare with the C++ code? Does\n`gfortran` deliver similar improvements as `gcc`?\n\n## More information\n\n- Docs CSC: [Compiling on Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/compiling-puhti/)\n- Docs CSC: [Compiling on Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/compiling-mahti/)\n- Docs LUMI: [Compiling on LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
