Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 2\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/installing_hands-on_python.html\n---\n\n# Python\n\n> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that:\n  - You have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n  - Your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\nüí¨ To run Python applications, first load a suitable Python module. CSC has\nseveral Python environments available with focus on different application\nareas, e.g. [data science and machine learning](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python-data/),\nas well as [geoinformatics](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/geoconda/).\n\nüí° For more details, please see the [Python page](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python/)\nin Docs CSC.\n\nüí≠ By selecting a suitable Python environment to start with, you'll minimize\nthe need to install additional packages.\n\n‚òùüèª Note that Conda environments should be containerized according to our\n[usage policy](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/#conda-installations).\nUse the [Tykky container wrapper](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/)\nto accomplish this easily!\n\n## Installing Python packages\n\nüí¨ To install simple packages it is usually enough to use `pip`, for example:\n\n```bash\npip install --user <package name>   # Or pip3 to ensure use of Python 3\n```\n\n‚òùüèª Remember to include `--user`. By default, `pip` tries to install to the\nsystem Python installation path, which will not work.\n\nüóØ For more complex installations you should create a\n[containerized environment](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/).\n\nüí° See the Docs CSC pages for each Python module for more details, as there may\nbe some environment-specific instructions.\n\n### Example: Installing a simple package with `pip`\n\nüí¨ Let's install a library called `coverage`.\n\n1. Start by loading a Python module and checking if the library is already\n   installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load python-data\n   python -c \"import coverage\"\n   ```\n\n2. The error message is indicating that the library is not available:\n\n   ```bash\n   Traceback (most recent call last):\n     File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'coverage'\n   ```\n\n3. Install the missing library:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install --user coverage  # This may take a while - don't worry!\n   ```\n\n4. Re-test to see if the library is now available:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import coverage\"\n   ```\n\n5. This time there's no error message, indicating that the import was\n   successful!\n6. User libraries are installed by default under `$HOME/.local`. It is a good\n   idea to change the installation folder, as the space in `$HOME` is limited:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONUSERBASE=/path/to/another/installdir/  # /projappl is recommended\n   ```\n\n7. To uninstall the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 uninstall coverage\n   ```\n\n8. Type `y` to confirm.\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Note, if the package you installed also contains executable files, i.e. a\ncommand-line interface, these commands may not work as is! This is because the\nPython modules provided by CSC are containerized and the user-installed\nbinaries will refer to an inaccessible Python path inside the container. For\nworkaround instructions, see our\n[Python documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python/#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules),\nor install your own environment from the beginning inside a container as\noutlined in the following example.\n\n## Example: Containerizing a Conda environment with Tykky\n\nüí¨ Let's create a containerized Conda environment using the Tykky wrapper.\n\n1. Create a folder under your project's `/projappl` directory for the\n   installation, e.g.:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /projappl/<project>/$USER/tykky-env  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n2. Create an `env.yml` environment file defining the packages to be installed.\n   Using for example `nano`, copy/paste the following contents to the file:\n\n   ```yaml\n   channels:\n     - conda-forge\n   dependencies:\n     - python=3.10.8\n     - scipy\n     - pandas\n     - nglview\n   ```\n\n3. Purge your current module environment and load the Tykky module:\n\n   ```bash\n   module purge\n   module load tykky\n   ```\n\n4. Create and containerize the Conda environment using the `conda-containerize`\n   command:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda-containerize new --prefix /projappl/<project>/$USER/tykky-env env.yml  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n   ‚òùüèª This process can take several minutes so be patient.\n\n5. As instructed by Tykky, add the path to the installation `bin` directory to\n   your `$PATH`\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
