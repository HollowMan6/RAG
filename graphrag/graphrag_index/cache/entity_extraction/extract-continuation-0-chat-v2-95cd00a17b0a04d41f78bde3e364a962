Select *View* to open a specific application.\n\n#### Close the application\nClosing the application cancels the access rights of the applicant and other application members. When the applicant and the application members do not need the access rights anymore, for example because the data permit has expired, you can cancel their access rights by selecting *Close application*.\n\n#### Revoke access rights\nIf the applicant has been granted access rights but they misuse them, you can revoke their rights by selecting *Revoke entitlement*. Revoking will add the applicant and all the application members to a blacklist. This means that if any of them tries to apply for access rights to the same dataset again, SD Apply will warn the application handlers. The owner of the dataset can edit the blacklist. You can find the blacklist from the \"Administration\" tab. \n\n### Email notifications\nYou will receive email notifications about the actions of other SD Apply users.
