A batch script for such an array job may look\nlike this:\n\n``` bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --array=1-16\n#SBATCH --output=array_%A_%a.out\n#SBATCH --error=array_%A_%a.err\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --mem=4G\n\n# Print the task index.\necho \"My SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID: \" $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID\n\nsrun ./myapp --input input_data_${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.inp\n```\n\nIn this example 16 array tasks will be launched (`--array=1-16`). These tasks\nwill be copies of the batch script: in our example, each array task will be\nallocated one task and 4 Gb of memory. The `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` environment\nvariable identifies each array task uniquely. In the example, we use this\nvariable to provide different input files for each of the array tasks.\n\nIf you want to reuse the same batch script for different array ranges, you can\nomit the `--array` directive in the batch script and instead specify the range\nwhen you submit your job.\n\n```bash\n$ sbatch --array=1-16 job.script\n```\n\n## Defining the array range\n\nThere are several ways to define the range of the index values for a job array:\n\n```bash\n# Job array with tasks index values from 0 to 15\n#SBATCH --array=0-15\n\n# Job array with tasks index values 1, 2, 9, 22 and 31\n#SBATCH --array=1,2,9,22,31\n\n# Job array with tasks index values 1, 3, 5 and 7\n#SBATCH --array=1-7:2\n\n# Job array with tasks index values 1, 3, 5, 7 and 20\n#SBATCH --array=1-7:2,20\n```\n\nYou can also specify the maximum number of simultaneously running tasks using\nthe `%` sign, e.g.\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --array=0-15%4\n```\n\nIn this example, the maximum number of array tasks running simultaneously will\nbe limited to 4.\n\n## Managing job array tasks\n\nUse the `squeue` command to examine the state of your job array. The still\npending array tasks are shown as one entry while the running ones are shown as\nindividual entries with their job IDs taking the form `<jobid>_<arrayindex>`.\n\n```bash\n$ squeue --me\n  JOBID   PARTITION     NAME     USER  ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n123456_[3-16] small  example lumi_usr  PD       0:00      1 (Resources)\n123456_1      small  example lumi_usr   R       0:17      1 node-0124\n123456_2      small  example lumi_usr   R       0:23      1 node-0125\n```\n\nIf you wish to cancel some of the array tasks of a job array, you can use the\n`scancel` command as with any other job. For example, to cancel array tasks\nwith indexes from 1 to 3 from job array 2021, use the following command\n\n```bash\n$ scancel 2021_[1-3]\n```\n\nwhich is equivalent to\n\n```bash\n$ scancel 2021_1 2021_2 2021_3\n```\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to cancel the whole job array, only specifying\nthe job ID suffice.\n\n```bash\n$ scancel 2021\n```\n\n## Environment variables\n\nIn addition to the `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` variable discussed above, Slurm will\nset additional environment variables that describe the job array. These\nvariables are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Variable                 | Description                            |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`    | Job array index value                  |\n| `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT` | Number of array tasks in the job array |\n| `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MIN`   | Value of the highest job array index   |\n| `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MAX`   | Value of the lowest job array index    |\n\n## Full array job example\n\nIn this section, we give a full example of running the same program with 1000\ndifferent command line arguments, submitted as an array job.\n\nThe parameters to use may be stored in a file, 1000 lines long and named\n`args.txt`. Each line in this file contains two parameters to be passed\nto our program as command-line arguments. As an example, the first 4 lines of\nthis file may be\n\n```bash\n$ head -n 4 args.txt\n  0.025 25.8\n  0.125 30.8\n  0.489 14.4\n  0.861 78.7\n```\n\nIn the context of a job array, we can extract the parameters for each of the\narray tasks with the help of the `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` variable.\nFor example, the first parameter can be obtained as\n\n```bash\nparam_a=$(cat args.txt | \\\nawk -v var=$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID 'NR==var {print $1}')\n```\n\nwhere we use `awk` to extract the line corresponding to the index of the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
