In most cases, you can use these images instead of creating your\nown. The images are created automatically using _diskimage-builder_. \nIf you are interested in the details of how\nthese images are created, see this [GitHub page]. The images are\nupdated at regular intervals so that they contain the latest security\nupdates at the time virtual machines are launched.\n\nIt is possible that for some use cases the automatically created\nimages are not suitable. In this case, it is possible to create your\nown images and use them instead. However, there are some caveats \nto consider when creating your own images that you would not\nneed to consider when using the default images. For more information,,\nsee [Advanced images](../adding-images)\n\n## The main features of the images provided by CSC\n\nThe images provided by CSC are mostly the same as upstream.\n\n* Most of the images come with the pre-configured username `cloud-user`,\nthough there are some exceptions to this rule.\n* We make sure that the images are updated before releasing them,\nso that we are sure that they work.\n* The `-Cuda` images come preinstalled with the latest CUDA drivers.\n* We enable automatic updates.\n* We disable password login.\n* We sometimes add some nice-to-have packages such as _vim_ or _ntp_. We try to\nkeep the additional packages at a minimum.\n\n## Images\n\n|Image|Username|Modified <br/>|\n|--- |:---:|:---:|\n|CentOS-9-Stream |**cloud-user** |no  |\n|AlmaLinux-8     |**almalinux**  |no  |\n|AlmaLinux-9     |**almalinux**  |no  |\n|Ubuntu-18.04    |**ubuntu**     |no  |\n|Ubuntu-20.04    |**ubuntu**     |no  |\n|Ubuntu-22.04    |**ubuntu**     |no  |\n|Ubuntu-24.04    |**ubuntu**     |no  |\n\n### CentOS-9-Stream\n\nThe CentOS community is now actively maintaining CentOS-9-Stream, which is the upstream branch for RHEL.\nGiven that updates and changes are first tested in CentOS and only subsequently deployed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), the resulting operating system is possibly less stable compared to its previous version, i.e., when RHEL was the upstream for CentOS.\nThe CentOS community [emphasizes](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/)\nthat the Stream version is nevertheless extremely close in terms of stability\nto the corresponding RHEL version.\nNote that this is the upstream version of the image, i.e., we do not perform\nany change to the image before making it available on our services. The default\nusername is `cloud-user`.\n\n### AlmaLinux-8 and AlmaLinux-9\n\nAlmaLinux is a linux distribution created in response to the termination\nof CentOS-8 project and the fundamental change of CentOS building process, due\nto which CentOS' traditional stability was impacted. AlmaLinux aims to be fully\nbinary-compatible with RedHat Enterprise Linux, and by doing so the linux\ndistribution effectively takes the role that CentOS used to have before the\nswitch to the -Stream versions. Note that these are the upstream versions of the\nAlmaLinux images, and their default username is `almalinux` instead of `cloud-user`.\n\n### Ubuntu-24.04, 22.04, 20.04 and 18.04 LTS\nSome like chocolate, some like strawberry. This is the choice for those that\ndo not want to use CentOS. Note that these are the upstream versions of the\nUbuntu images, and their default username is `ubuntu` instead of `cloud-user`.\n\n## Snowflake images\nThese images you should probably not use without a really good\nreason. You might be better off [creating your own image](../adding-images)\n\nIf there any images that you think we should add, do not hesitate to contact\n[Service Desk](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi).\n\n### cirros\nThis is a really small image which can be used to boot an instance really fast.\nThis can be useful for doing tests in Pouta, such as testing if the network works or\nhow fast you can launch an instance. You should not use this for persistent\nVMs, and you should always delete the instance when you are done with\ntesting. There is very little reason for end-users using this image, and if\nyou are unsure, CentOS and Ubuntu are better choices 99% of the time. \n\n[GitHub page]: https://github.com/CSC-IT-Center-for-Science/diskimage-builder-csc-automation\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides a set of standard images for cloud use, updates them with the latest security updates, and allows the creation of custom images with certain caveats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISKIMAGE-BUILDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used by CSC for automatically creating cloud images, with its details available on a GitHub page)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTOS-9-STREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A version of CentOS actively maintained by the CentOS community as the upstream branch for RHEL, with `cloud-user` as the default username)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMALINUX-8<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Linux distribution created in response to the termination of the CentOS-8 project, aiming to be fully binary-compatible with RHEL, with `almalinux` as the default username)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMALINUX-9<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Similar to AlmaLinux-8, it aims to replace CentOS's role and ensure stability and compatibility with RHEL, with `almalinux` as the default username)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU-18.04<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An upstream version of the Ubuntu image provided by CSC with `ubuntu` as the default username)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU-20.04<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An upstream version of the Ubuntu image provided by CSC with `ubuntu` as the default username)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU-22.04<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An upstream version of the Ubuntu image provided by CSC with `ubuntu` as the default username)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU-24.04<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An upstream version of the Ubuntu image provided by CSC with `ubuntu` as the default username)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIRROS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A small image provided by CSC for quick instance booting for testing purposes, not recommended for persistent VMs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The contact point for CSC users to suggest new images or seek assistance)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>DISKIMAGE-BUILDER<|>CSC uses diskimage-builder for creating cloud images<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>CENTOS-9-STREAM<|>CSC provides the CentOS-9-Stream image for cloud use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>ALMALINUX-8<|>CSC provides the AlmaLinux-8 image for cloud use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>ALMALINUX-9<|>CSC provides the AlmaLinux-9 image for cloud use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>UBUNTU-18.04<|>CSC provides the Ubuntu-18.04 image for cloud use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>UBUNTU-20.04<|>CSC provides the Ubuntu-20.04 image for cloud use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>UBUNTU-22.04<|>CSC provides the Ubuntu-22.04 image for cloud use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>UBUNTU-24.04<|>CSC provides the Ubuntu-24.04 image for cloud use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>CIRROS<|>CSC provides the Cirros image for quick testing purposes<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>SERVICE DESK<|>Service Desk is the contact point for CSC users, indicating a support relationship<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
