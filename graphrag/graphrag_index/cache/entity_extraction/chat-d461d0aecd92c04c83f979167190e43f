Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2.

First, we must\nselect a project for billing and partition for computing resources.\n\n![julia jupyter options](../../img/julia-jupyter/options-2.png)\n\nNext, we must set the desired computing resources: CPU cores, memory, local\ndisk, and time.\n\n![julia jupyter options](../../img/julia-jupyter/options-3.png)\n\nFinally, we must select the Jupyter type. We recommend using Jupyter lab, but\nthe classic notebook is also available. The working directory sets the root\ndirectory for Jupyter. The Julia depot directory sets the location for package\ninstallations, compiled files, and other Julia depots. If you plan to install\nlarge amounts of Julia packages, we recommend using `/projappl` or `/scratch`\ninstead of the `$HOME` directory as it could run out of quota. For example,\nPlots.jl installs over 10k files and is quite large.\n\n## Starting Julia kernel\n\n![available julia kernels on jupyter lab](../../img/julia-jupyter/julia-kernels.png)\n\nInside the Jupyter session, we can start notebooks with the desired Julia\nversion. Starting a kernel loads the corresponding Julia module and starts the\nnotebook. We launch the Julia kernel using\n[IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl). Note that the Jupyter\ninstallation for Julia is separate from the Jupyter installation for Python and\nis not intended for other use.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
