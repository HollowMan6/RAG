Look for the\n[academic license text here](http://ambermd.org/LicenseAmber22.pdf).\n\n## Usage\n\nSee available versions and how to load Amber by running:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider amber\n```\n\nOn LUMI, you need to add the CSC modules to your module path before running the\nabove command:\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n```\n\nThe `module load` command will set `$AMBERHOME` and put the AmberTools binaries\nin the path. Run Amber production jobs in the batch queues, see below. Very\nlight system preparation (serial AmberTools jobs lasting a few seconds and\nusing barely any memory) can be done on the login node as well. Heavier\nanalyses can be run e.g. in an\n[interactive compute session](#interactive-jobs).\n\nMolecular dynamics jobs are best run with `pmemd.cuda` as they are much faster\non GPUs than on CPUs. Please note that using `pmemd.cuda` requires a module\nwith the `-cuda` extension. Similarly on LUMI one should use `pmemd.hip` (or\n`pmemd.hip.MPI` for multi-GPU simulations), which requires loading a module\nwith the `-gpu` extension.\n\nRun only GPU aware binaries in the GPU partitions. If you're unsure, check with\n`seff <slurm_jobid>` that GPUs *were* used and that the job was significantly\nfaster than without GPUs.\n\n!!! info \"Python modules\"\n    Python scripts distributed with AmberTools are only available in the\n    Amber22 modules on Puhti/Mahti. However, since AmberTools is also\n    distributed through [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ambertools),\n    you can easily create a containerized environment containing these scripts\n    yourself using [Tykky](../computing/containers/tykky.md) or the\n    [LUMI container wrapper](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/container-wrapper/).\n\n### Example batch scripts for Puhti and Mahti\n\n=== \"Puhti (GPU)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=gputest\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1\n\n    # Our tests show that for medium-sized systems the most efficient setup is\n    # one GPU card and one CPU core.\n\n    module purge\n    module load gcc/9.4.0 openmpi/4.1.4\n    module load amber/22-cuda\n\n    srun pmemd.cuda -O -i mdin -r restrt -x mdcrd -o mdout\n    ```\n\n=== \"Puhti (CPU)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=test\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n\n    # The non-GPU aware binaries, e.g. AmberTools, can be run as batch jobs in\n    # the following way:\n\n    module purge\n    module load gcc/9.4.0 openmpi/4.1.4\n    module load amber/22\n\n    srun paramfit -i Job_Control.in -p prmtop -c mdcrd -q QM_data.dat\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti (GPU)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n    #SBATCH --partition=gputest\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:1\n\n    module purge\n    module load gcc/9.4.0 openmpi/4.1.2\n    module load amber/22-cuda\n\n    srun pmemd.cuda -O -i mdin.GPU -o mdout.GPU -p Cellulose.prmtop -c Cellulose.inpcrd\n    ```\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    `pmemd.cuda` (and `pmemd.hip` on LUMI) are way faster than `pmemd.MPI`, so\n    use a CPU-version only in case you cannot use the GPU-version. If Amber\n    performance is not fast enough, consider using [GROMACS](gromacs.md), which\n    is typically able to scale further (i.e. make use of more CPU and/or GPU\n    resources). Consider also whether you really need speed or just a lot of\n    sampling. Accelerated sampling can also be achieved through ensemble\n    simulations, where multiple independent trajectories (e.g. the same system\n    equilibrated from different initial velocities) are run at the same time.\n    For more details, see the section on\n    [high-throughput simulations with Amber](#high-throughput-com\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
