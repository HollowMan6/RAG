Details for logging in to the LUMI web interface can be read through the [LUMI Documentation page](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/loggingin-webui/).\n\n### Accessing Helmi\n\nAfter successfully authenticating, you should now have access to your dashboard. Click on the Jupyter app, select your project and the partition as q_fiqci. If you have an active reservation, you can use it by selecting it under reservation.\n\nIt is recommended to use the 'Advanced settings'. Under the 'Custom init' option select Text, and under the 'Script to start' textbox enter the following script to configure the environment to use the quantum software stack.\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/quantum/modulefiles\nmodule load helmi_qiskit # or module load helmi_cirq\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"../../../../img/helmi_with_lumi_web.png\" alt=\"Helmi's with LUMI web\">\n</p>\n\nClick on launch to start your Jupyter session. This will launch Jupyter using the command python -m Jupyter lab. If you are using Helmi during a quantum computing course, a custom environment may have been created specifically for the course. In this case, you can access Helmi using the Jupyter-for-courses app.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"../../../../img/helmi_with_jupyter_for_courses_gui.png\" alt=\"Helmi's with LUMI web\">\n</p>\n\n\n## Further Reading\n* [Lumi web interface](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/)\n* [Jupyter on Lumi web interface](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/jupyter/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The CSC Service Desk provides support and is contactable via email at servicedesk@csc.fi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI WEB INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform that allows users to run quantum jobs on Helmi through a web interface, with detailed login instructions available on the LUMI Documentation page)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Quantum computing environment accessible via the LUMI web interface, supports quantum software stacks like Qiskit and Cirq)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI WEB INTERFACE<|>HELMI<|>The LUMI Web Interface is used to access and run quantum jobs on Helmi<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>HELMI<|>The CSC Service Desk provides support for users of Helmi<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
