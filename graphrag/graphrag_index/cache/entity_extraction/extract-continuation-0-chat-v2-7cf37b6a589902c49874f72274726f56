Thus, normal SD desktop users can not \nmake backup copies of the data that they have in SD Desktop. This tutorial demonstrates the usage of `backup_server.sh` \nprocess and `sd-backup` commands that provide a way for SD Users to back up their data to SD Connect.\n\n## Installation \n\nThe tools for running backup process are not by default installed in SD Desktop Virtual Machines. Thus, the first step is that the \nmanager installs the **SD Backup tool** package using the [SD software installer](./sd-software-installer.md). \n\nLog in to your SD Desktop and open **Data Gateway**. If the software installation help tools are enabled for your project, then you should have folder: \n`tools-for-sd-desktop` included in the directory that Data Gateway created (in `Projects/SD-Connect/your-project-name`). If you don't find `tools-for-sd-desktop` \ndirectory through Data Gateway **send a request to [CSC Service Desk](../../../support/contact.md)**. In the request, indicate that you wish that the SD Desktop software installation help tools would \nbe made available for your project. You must also include to the message the **Project identifier string** of your project.\nYou can check this random string for example in the [SD Connect service](https://sd-connect.csc.fi). There you find the \nProject Identifier in the **User information** view.\n\nOpen `tools-for-sd-desktop` folder and from there, drag/copy file `sd-installer.desktop` to your desktop.\n\n[![Installing-sd-installer](../images/desktop/sd-installer1.png)](../images/desktop/sd-installer1.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** Copying `sd-installer.desktop` file to SD desktop.\n \nDouble-click the copy of `sd-installer.desktop` to start the software installation tool. Use this tool to install _SD Backup_ tool\nto your SD Desktop virtual machine if you have not yet done so. \n\n## Project Mangers Starts backup server\n\nWhen the SD Backup tool is installed, the Project Manager should start a new terminal session and there start a virtual terminal session with command:\n\n```text\nscreen\n```\n\nand then launch the backup process with command:\n\n```text\nsd-backup-server.sh\n```\n\nWhen launched, `sd-backup-server.sh` asks for the CSC password of the Project Manager.\n\nAfter that the project manager can leave the virtual session running in background by pressing:\n`Ctrl+a+d`.\n\nThis way the `sd-backup-server.sh` command remains active in the virtual terminal session even when the connection to SD Desktop is closed.\n\nThe actual server process is very simple. It checks the content of the backup directory once in a minute and moves the contents of this directory \nto a bucket in SD Connect. The data is encrypted with CSC public key so that the backups can be used only in SD Desktop environment.\nThe default backup directory is `/shared-data/auto-backup` and target bucket in SD Connect is `sdd-backup-<virtual-machine-name>`. \n\nNote that the server is not able to check if the given password was correct. If a wrong password was given then backup requests will fail. \nThus, it may be good to test the backup process once the server is running.\n\n## Doing backups\n\nWhen the backup server is running, all users of the VM can use command `sd-backup` to make a backup copy of the dataset to SD Connect.\nThe syntax of the `sd-backup` command is:\n\n```text\nsd-backup file.csv\n```\n\nor\n\n```text\nsd-backup directory\n```\n\nThe command copies the given file or directory to the backup directory from where the server process is able to move it to SD Connect.\nIn SD Connect a timestamp is added to the file name in order to make the file name unique. In addition, a metadata file is\ncreated. This file contains information about the user who requested the backup, original host and location of the file. If backup is done for \na directory, then the content of the directory is stored as one tar-archive file and the metadata file will contain list of the backed-up files. \n \nFor example, for a file called `my_data.csv` that locates in SD Desktop virtual machine called `secserver-1683868755`, a backup command:\n\n```text\nsd-backup  my_data.csv\n```\n\nWill create a backup file that will be available through Data Gateway in path:\n\n```text\nProjects/SD-Connect/project_number/sdd-backup-secserver-1683868755/my_data.csv-2023-05-15-07:41\n```\n\nNote that you have to refresh the Data Gateway connection in order to see the changes in SD Connect.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Desktop is a virtual machine environment for users to work on projects securely)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT MANAGER<|>PERSON<|>The individual responsible for managing the project and has exclusive rights to export data from SD Desktop)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD USERS<|>PERSON<|>Users of the SD Desktop environment who work on various projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD BACKUP TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package that enables backup functionalities within the SD Desktop environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform where SD Desktop users can back up their data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Support desk for users of SD Desktop to request assistance and tools for their projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD BACKUP SERVER.SH<|>EVENT<|>A process initiated by the Project Manager to start the backup server on SD Desktop)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT MANAGER<|>SD DESKTOP<|>The Project Manager has exclusive rights to manage data export and backup functionalities in SD Desktop<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD USERS<|>SD DESKTOP<|>SD Users work within the SD Desktop environment on various projects<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD BACKUP TOOL<|>SD DESKTOP<|>The SD Backup Tool is installed on SD Desktop virtual machines to facilitate data backups<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD USERS<|>SD CONNECT<|>SD Users can back up their data to SD Connect using specific commands and processes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT MANAGER<|>SD BACKUP TOOL<|>The Project Manager is responsible for installing the SD Backup Tool on SD Desktop<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT MANAGER<|>SD BACKUP SERVER.SH<|>The Project Manager initiates the sd-backup-server.sh process to start the backup server<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD BACKUP SERVER.SH<|>SD CONNECT<|>The sd-backup-server.sh process facilitates the transfer of backup data to SD Connect<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SERVICE DESK<|>SD USERS<|>SD Users may contact the CSC Service Desk for support and requests related to SD Desktop<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
