Turku 50\n```\n\nYou can also define several columns to be used for sorting. For\nexample, the following command uses the numerical order of the fourth\ncolumn as the primary sorting criteria (`-k4n`). In cases where\nseveral rows have the same value in the fourth column, the alphabetical\norder is used as the secondary sorting criteria (`-k2`):\n\n```bash\nsort -k4n -k2 authors.txt\n```\n\nIn this case, the result is:\n\n```text\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50\n```\n\nThe sorted data can be saved to a new file either by using option `-o`\nor redirecting the standard output to a file with `>`. For example,\nboth commands below create the same file containing the sorted version\nof the file `authors.txt`.\n\n```bash\nsort -k4n -k2 -o authors_sorted.txt authors.txt\nsort -k4n -k2 authors.txt > authors_sorted.txt\n```\n\n## Removing duplicate rows with `uniq`\n\nThe command `uniq` is often used in combination with the\n`sort` command to remove redundancy from a data set. The `uniq` command\nchecks if two successive rows in the input file or standard input are\nidentical. By default, `uniq` removes the successive duplicate rows.\nNote that `uniq` does not check if an identical row exists elsewhere in\nthe input. Because of that, the data is normally sorted before applying\nthe `uniq` command. As an example, say we have a file called `names`\nthat contains the following rows:\n\n```text\nPekka\nPekka\nLeena\nMarkus\nEeva\nLeena\n```\n\nRunning the command\n\n```bash\nuniq names\n```\n\nwill give the following output:\n\n```text\nPekka\nLeena\nMarkus\nEeva\nLeena\n```\n\nIn the output, row *Leena* still occurs twice as the two identical\nnames were not in successive rows. The situation can be fixed by\nsorting the rows before `uniq` is applied. For example,\n\n```bash\nsort names | uniq\n```\n\nprints the following output\n\n```text\nEeva\nLeena\nMarkus\nPekka\n```\n\nIt is often useful to know, how many identical rows were found. This\ninformation can be added to the output of `uniq` with the option `-c`.\nFor example,\n\n```bash\nsort names | uniq -c\n```\n\ngives the following output:\n\n```text\n1 Eeva\n2 Leena\n1 Markus\n2 Pekka\n```\n\nNote that also *Space* and *Tabulator* characters are used when `uniq`\ncompares the rows. Thus, a row containing \"Leena\" is not identical to a\nrow containing \"Leena \". By default, `uniq` is case-sensitive, but using\noption `-i` makes `uniq` to ignore the cases and consider \"leena\" and\n\"Leena\" to be identical. However, note that if you use case-insensitive\n`uniq`, you may need to do also the sorting in case-insensitive mode\nusing command `sort -f`.\n\n## Replacing characters with `tr`\n\nThe `tr` command (translate) is used to replace individual\ncharacters. `tr` reads the standard input and writes the translated data\nto the standard output. The syntax of `tr` command is\n\n```bash\ntr search_character replacement_character\n```\n\nFor example, dots (`.`) in the file `authors.txt` could be replaced with\ncommas (`,`) with the command\n\n```bash\ntr \".\" \",\" < authors.txt\n```\n\nwhich prints out\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen, Oulu 50\nMarkus Aho, Turku 50\nPekka Niemi, Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen, Kuopio 32\n```\n\nNote that the command above does not modify the original input file in\nany way. In the examples here, the results of `tr` command are printed\nto the screen. When `tr` is used to modify large files, the output\nshould of course be redirected to a new file instead of the screen. For\nexample,\n\n```bash\ntr \".\" \",\" < authors.txt > authors_mod.txt\n```\n\nIf you would like to remove the dots, you could use the option `-d`\nwith just one character set, telling what characters are to be removed:\n\n```bash\ntr -d \".\" < authors.txt\n```\n\nNote that the `tr` translates individual characters, not words. Thus,\ncommand `tr \"Oulu\" \"Turku\"` would not change the word \"Oulu\" to \"Turku\".\nInstead, it would do the following character conversions to the whole text:\n`O->T`, `l->r`, `u->k`. The `tr` command can do translations with\nspecial characters, like tabulator (`\\t`) and newline (`\\n`), and with\npredefined character sets like all lower case letters (`[:lower:]`) and\nall upper case letters (`[:upper:]`). For example,\n\n```bash\ntr \".\" \"\\n\" < authors.txt\n```\n\nwould replace the dots with line breaks in the file `authors.txt`:\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen\n Oulu 50\nMarkus Aho\n Turku 50\nPekka Niemi\n Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen\n Kuop\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
