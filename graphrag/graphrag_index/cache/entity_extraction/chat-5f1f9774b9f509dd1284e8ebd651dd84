To enable R to find your data, you will need to indicate this location in your R script. After launching R, you can print out the location using the following command:\n\n```\nSys.getenv(\"LOCAL_SCRATCH\")\n```\n\n#### R interface to TensorFlow\n\nThe `r-env` module supports GPU-accelerated TensorFlow jobs using the [R interface to TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/). If you only require TensorFlow without access to R, please use one of the available [TensorFlow modules on Puhti](tensorflow.md). For general information on submitting GPU jobs, [see this tutorial](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md). Note that `r-env` includes CUDA and cuDNN libraries, so there is no need to load CUDA and cuDNN modules separately.\n\nTo submit a GPU job using the R interface to TensorFlow, you need to use the GPU partition and specify the type and number of GPUs using the `--gres` flag. The rest is handled by the R script (see [this page for examples](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/examples/). In the script below, we would reserve a single GPU and 10 CPUs in a single node:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_tensorflow\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=gpu\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1\n\n# Load the module\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save myscript.R\n```\n\nPlease note that interactive work using GPU acceleration (e.g. with RStudio) is not supported.\n\n#### GPU acceleration using NVBLAS\n\nIt is possible to configure `r-env` to use NVIDIA NVBLAS, a drop-in BLAS replacement with GPU support for several BLAS3 routines (for details, see the [NVBLAS website](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvblas/index.html)). Routines not supported by NVBLAS are directed to a fallback BLAS library, i.e. oneMKL in the case of the `r-env` module.\n\nCompared to CPU jobs, using NVBLAS may offer speed improvements without changes to the underlying R code. However, the benefits afforded are strongly analysis-specific. Additionally, NVBLAS jobs make sub-optimal use of reservations on the GPU partition, with only certain operations being routed to the GPU.\n\nPrior to running a NVBLAS job, consider the [Puhti GPU node usage policy](../../computing/usage-policy#gpu-nodes) and this checklist:\n\n- Are BLAS3 routines the main bottleneck in your workflow? \n- Are speed-ups possible through other means (e.g. rewriting your code)?\n- Can certain parts of your script be run on a CPU partition rather than the GPU partition?\n\nNVBLAS can be used by following these steps:\n\nStep 1. Create a file called `nvblas.conf` in `~/nvblas` with the following contents:\n\n```\nNVBLAS_LOGFILE nvblas.log\nNVBLAS_GPU_LIST ALL\nNVBLAS_TRACE_LOG_ENABLED\nNVBLAS_CPU_BLAS_LIB /opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/2022.1.0/lib/intel64/libmkl_rt.so\n```\nNote that the CPU BLAS library listed above is specific to `r-env/421`.\nAdding `NVBLAS_TRACE_LOG_ENABLED` is optional and prompts NVBLAS to create a list of all intercepted BLAS calls for debugging.\n\nStep 2. Add the following lines to your GPU batch job file:\n\n```\n# Use NVBLAS\nexport APPTAINERENV_LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libnvblas.so\nexport APPTAINERENV_NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE=~/nvblas/nvblas.conf\n```\n\n#### Using `r-env` with Stan\n\nThe `r-env` module includes several packages that make use of [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for statistical modelling.\n\n!!! note\n    The thread affinity variable `APPTAINERENV_OMP_PLACES=cores` has been found to interfere with parallel jobs using the `rstan` package. We currently recommend that this variable should not be used for parallel R jobs with Stan.\n\n*Using R with the CmdStan backend* \n\nThe `r-env` module comes with a separate [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) installation that is specific to each module version.\nTo use it, one must set the correct path to CmdStan using `cmdstanr\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
