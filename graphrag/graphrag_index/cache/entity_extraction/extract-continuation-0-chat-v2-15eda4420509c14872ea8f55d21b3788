`/opt/rocm` (which is rather old).\n  **This Spack module is deprecated and should not be used!**\n  MPI programs may not work, and the linked ROCm is ancient and does not exist on the system anymore.\n\n## Spack on LUMI (advanced)\n\nThis section further explains the Spack setup on LUMI.\n\nThe upstream Spack instances maintained by the [User Support Team][helpdesk]\nare located in subdirectories of `/appl/lumi/spack`, numbered according to the\nCray Programming Environment release version, and Spack release version. For\nexample:\n\n```text\n/appl/lumi/spack/22.08/0.18.1/\n```\n\nThis is a Spack instance based on Spack release 0.18.1 configured to use the\ncompilers and MPI libraries from the Cray Programming Environment release\n22.08. In general, we will only install one or two versions of Spack per programming\nenvironment. **These instances are not meant to be used directly by users** as\nthey are configured to install packages centrally, i.e. `spack install` will\nfail with permission errors, but you can copy the configuration files from\nthere if you want to make your own Spack instance.\n\nInstead, for users, there are \"fake\" chained Spack instances installed\nalongside these which are configured with install packages in a user-specified\nlocation. These instances have names which end in `-user`, e.g.:\n\n```text\n/appl/lumi/spack/22.08/0.18.1-user/\n```\n\nThis is what the `spack` modules use, and what you should use as user on the\nsystem if you do not want set up your own Spack instance. If you check the `etc/spack/config.yaml` inside, you will see that they set the `install_tree` property to a value provided by `$SPACK_USER_PREFIX`.\n\n```text\nconfig:\n    build_jobs: 32\n    install_path_scheme: '{name}-{version}-{hash:7}'\n    install_tree: $SPACK_USER_PREFIX/22.08/0.18.1\n    source_cache: $SPACK_USER_PREFIX/22.08/0.18.1/cache\n    misc_cache:   $SPACK_USER_PREFIX/22.08/0.18.1/cache\n    install_missing_compilers: false\n    suppress_gpg_warnings: true\n```\n\nA similar trick is used in the `modules.yaml` file to install modules in\n`$SPACK_USER_PREFIX/22.08/0.18.1/modules/tcl`.\n\n```text\nmodules:\n  default:\n    roots:\n      tcl: $SPACK_USER_PREFIX/22.08/0.18.1/modules/tcl\n    enable:\n      - tcl\n    tcl:\n      hash_length: 5\n      projections:\n        all: '{name}/{version}-{compiler.name}'\n```\n\nIf you want to use Spack directly (without `module load spack`), you can source\nthe Spack initialization scripts as usual. They can be found on disk in e.g.:\n\n```bash\n$ source /appl/lumi/spack/22.08/0.18.1-user/share/spack/setup-env.sh\n```\n\nYou need to make sure that `$SPACK_USER_PREFIX` is set and that the\n`cache` and `modules/tcl` subdirectories exist within that directory.\n\n### Overriding the default settings in the Spack module\n\nThe `spack` modules read the configuration files from the `/appl/lumi/spack/.../etc/` directory, which is read-only for users.\nTo change the configuration files, you need to override the default settings by placing new configuration files (like `compilers.yaml` and `packages.yaml`) in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROCM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ROCM refers to a series of software drivers and packages related to GPU computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI-G refers to compute nodes that utilize ROCM drivers for operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spack is a package management system that builds software from source, configured for various environments including Cray Programming Environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of software tools and libraries aimed to facilitate programming on Cray systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hewlett Packard Enterprise, provider of ROCM packages in certain Spack modules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER SUPPORT TEAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A team responsible for maintaining Spack instances and providing user support)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROCM<|>LUMI-G<|>ROCM drivers are installed on LUMI-G compute nodes for GPU computing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACK<|>CRAY PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT<|>Spack release versions are based on the Cray Programming Environment versions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACK<|>ROCM<|>Spack builds ROCM packages from source for use in computing environments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HPE<|>ROCM<|>HPE provides ROCM packages that are used in certain Spack modules<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER SUPPORT TEAM<|>SPACK<|>The User Support Team maintains Spack instances for user support<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
