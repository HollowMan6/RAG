Request access to the tools-for-sd-connect or upload your own PostgreSQL singularity container to SD Connect. Start a SD Desktop Virtual Machine that has data volume that is big enough for your data. Login to your SD Desktop, open Data Gateway connection to SD Connect and open a terminal session.\n\n2. In the terminal session, create directory `/media/volume/psql` and move there\n\n    ```text\n    mkdir/media/volume/psql\n    cd /media/volume/psql\n    ```\n\n3. Import Apptainer container containing PostreSQL\n\n    ```text\n    cp $HOME/Projects/SD\\ connect/*/tools-for-sd-desktop/apptainer/postgres_14.2-alpine3.15.sif ./\n    ```\n\n4. Create PostgreSQL environment file (`pg.env`) to be used.\n\n    ```text\n    module load nano\n    nano pg.env\n    ```\n\n5. Add following settings to the file\n\n    ```text\n    export TZ=Europe/Helsinki\n    export POSTGRES_USER=pguser\n    export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pg123\n    export POSTGRES_DB=mydb\n    export POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=\"--encoding=UTF-8\"\n    ```\n\n    Then save and exit nano.\n\n6. Create directories for PostgreSQL server\n\n    ```text\n    mkdir pgdata\n    mkdir pgrun \n    ```\n\n7. Start a screen session in your terminal session and launch database server using the container:\n\n    ```text\n    screen\n    apptainer run -B pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -B pgrun:/var/run/postgresql -e -C --env-file pg.env postgres_14.2-alpine3.15.sif\n    ```\n\n    Then leave the screen session by pressing:\n\n    ```text\n    Ctrl-a-d\n    ```\n\n    The server should now continue running in the screen session.\n\n8. Open a shell session into your PostgreSQL container. Remember to mount the directory where you have your data\n(e.g. `/shared-directory`)\n\n    ```text\n    apptainer shell -B /shared-directory:/shared-directory postgres_14.2-alpine3.15.sif\n    ```\n\n    Inside container, move to your data directory and star working with your database:\n\n    ```text\n    cd  /shared-directory\n    psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d mydb -U pguser\n    ```\n\n    For example\n\n    ```text\n    psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d mydb -U pguser f psql_dump_file.sql\n    ```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
