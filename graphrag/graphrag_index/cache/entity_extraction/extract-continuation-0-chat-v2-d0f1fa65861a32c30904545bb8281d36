For example, one could:\n\n- Leverage many CPU cores to speed up an R function\n- Submit several concurrently running Slurm jobs\n- Split jobs over many compute nodes\n\nThis tutorial aims to discuss some of the key concepts and terms behind parallelising an analysis in R, and to offer practical tips for planning parallel R analyses on CSC's Puhti. Links are also provided for further reading.\n\n## Using multiple cores\n\nParallel R analyses can make use of *multiprocessing*, *multithreading* or both. Many R packages mention support for *multicore* parallelism - this is a general term encompassing both multiprocessing and multithreading. The exact way in which multiple cores are used depends on the R package.\n\n**Multiprocessing**\n\nMultiprocessing refers to analyses involving several independent R processes. In other words, multiple copies of R are launched that collectively execute the job. In multiprocessing, each R process is allocated to a separate CPU core. This is perhaps the most common way to parallelise an analysis in R.\n\nAnalyses relying on multiprocessing often involve setting up a cluster within the R script. In this context, the term **cluster** denotes a group of R processes: \n\n- For example, `cl <- getMPIcluster()` in the package `snow`\n    - Other examples of R packages using clusters include `parallel`, `doMPI` and `future`\n\nWhen setting up a cluster, one can specify how the indendent R processes should communicate with one another. There are two cluster types:\n\n- In a **fork** cluster, the current R process is copied and allocated to a new core. Analyses using fork clusters are often faster than those using socket clusters, but support for them is limited to POSIX systems (including Linux and Mac). \n- In a **socket** cluster, an entirely new R process is allocated to each core, with each process starting with an empty environment. While slower than fork clusters, socket clusters are also supported by Windows.\n\nMoreover, R processes are often split into a **master** process and **worker** processes. In the master-worker paradigm, the master process is responsible for assigning and post-processing of the work, while the actual execution is handled by worker processes.\n\n**Multithreading**\n\nThe default behaviour of R is to use a single thread at a time. However, R can be separately configured to use BLAS/LAPACK libraries that can utilise multiple cores via *multithreading*. Multithreading can help speed up certain (e.g. linear algebra) routines. The R installation in `r-env` has been linked with [Intel® OneMKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) to enable support for multithreading.\n\nWhile `r-env` is linked with OneMKL, the module is configured to use a single thread unless the user specifies otherwise. In multithreaded analyses, the number of threads is typically matched with the number of cores using the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. More information can be found in the [`r-env` documentation](../../apps/r-env.md#improving-performance-using-threading).\n\nCertain R packages (such as [`mgcv`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/mgcv/html/mgcv-parallel.html) and [`ranger`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/ranger.pdf)) offer direct support for multithreading. Jobs using other types of R packages could also benefit from multithreading, depending on the analysis. However, **it is always recommended** to check your job using a single *versus* multiple threads to confirm whether any speed-up is obtained and that the results remain correct when using multithreading.\n\n**Combining multiprocessing and multithreading**\n\nIt is also possible to run jobs that combine multiprocessing and multithreading. Here, several cores are allocated to each process. Each process can then run several threads, so that each thread runs on a single core. The number of processes times the number of threads per process should equal the number of cores used by the job. For example, a job using a single node in Puhti (40 cores) could use 10 processes and four threads per process.\n\n## Submitting concurrent jobs\n\nFor this purpose, the recommended way is to submit an [array job](../../computing/running/array-jobs.md). Example batch job files can be found in the [`r-env` documentation](../../apps/r-env.md#parallel-batch-jobs) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/puhti/05_array). Array jobs are suitable for executing the same code using different parameters, or any other situation where the parallel tasks are independent (i.e. they do not need to communicate with one another).\n\n## Multinode analyses\n\nRegardless of whether you are running a serial, multiprocess or multithreaded R job, it is possible to distribute your analysis over multiple Puhti nodes. To do so, your batch job file and R script will require some modifications, compared to an analysis running on a single node. You will also need to use R packages that are compatible with multinode jobs, such as `snow` or `future`. \n\nA number of practical examples can be found under the [parallel batch jobs section of the `r-env` documentation](../../apps/r-env.md#parallel-batch-jobs). Multinode R examples using raster data can also be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/puhti).\n\nOne topic of note is that setting up multiprocess and/or multithread jobs on multiple nodes (so-called hybrid jobs) is a special case of its own.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>R<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R is a programming language used for statistical computing and graphics, mentioned in the context of parallelisation and analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC'S PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC's Puhti is a supercomputer at the CSC - IT Center for Science, used for high-performance computing tasks and parallel R analyses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEL® ONEMKL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intel® OneMKL is a software library linked with the R environment to enable support for multithreading in R analyses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snow is an R package that supports parallel computing by setting up clusters for multiprocessing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARALLEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parallel is an R package that supports parallel computing, including both multiprocessing and multithreading)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>doMPI is an R package that allows for parallel computing using MPI (Message Passing Interface) for communication between R processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Future is an R package designed for asynchronous programming and parallel computing in R)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MGCV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>mgcv is an R package that supports multithreading for speeding up certain routines, such as linear algebra)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ranger is an R package that provides an implementation of random forests and supports multithreading for faster computation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R<|>CSC'S PUHTI<|>R analyses are performed on CSC's Puhti supercomputer, demonstrating the application of R in high-performance computing environments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW<|>R<|>Snow is an R package, indicating its direct relationship with the R programming language for parallel computing tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARALLEL<|>R<|>Parallel is an R package, showing its integration with R for parallel computing capabilities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOMPI<|>R<|>doMPI is an R package, showcasing its use with R for parallel computing through MPI<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUTURE<|>R<|>Future is an R package, highlighting its role in enhancing R with asynchronous programming and parallel computing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MGCV<|>R<|>mgcv is an R package, emphasizing its compatibility with R for multithreading in specific routines<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANGER<|>R<|>ranger is an R package, underlining its function within R for fast computation through multithreading<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEL® ONEMKL<|>R<|>Intel® OneMKL is linked with the R environment to enable multithreading, showing a technical integration for performance enhancement<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
