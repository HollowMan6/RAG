F1 needs a specialist interface.\n- Please read this page for an introduction on [how to log in with SSH](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/)\n   - Mac and Linux have SSH. On Windows, Powershell can be used, but we recommend the web interfaces, or clients like MobaXterm or PuTTY\n   - Note the [prerequisites to be able to access Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-get-puhti-access/)\n- Plain SSH will not allow displaying remote graphics\n   - The web interfaces are often best for this, but can be enabled also by X11-tunneling (additional installations required on Windows, see link above)\n\n# Moving files between a local computer and Puhti\n\n- [`scp`](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/scp/) and [`rsync`](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/rsync/) are powerful command-line tools to copy files\n   - `scp` works even in Windows Powershell (but `rsync` is missing)\n   - _e.g._ `scp filename cscusername@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_xxxx`\n   - _e.g._ `rsync -r foldername cscusername@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_xxxx`\n   - `rsync` exists in _MobaXterm_ but it removes write permissions of copied files\n- Sometimes a [GUI tool for transferring files](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/graphical_transfer/) is more convenient\n   - Nice tools are _e.g._ _FileZilla_ and _WinSCP_ (may require admin privileges)\n   - _MobaXterm_ also has a file transfer GUI (Tip: first, set persistent home directory)\n   - The web interfaces can also be used to easily upload/download files\n\n# Advanced topic: Setting up SSH keys\n\n- Using SSH keys is easier and safer than using a password with every login\n- SSH keys can be easily used in Windows, Mac, Linux\n- Consult our [tutorials on how to set up SSH keys for your account](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/#setting-up-ssh-keys)\n   - [Logging in to LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/getstarted/) requires setting up an SSH key pair *and* registering the public key in [My CSC](https:/my.csc.fi)\n   - Adding SSH keys in MyCSC for Puhti and Mahti is also possible, but not currently a requirement for connecting\n\n# Advanced topic: Developing scripts remotely\n\n- It's possible to use a local editor and push edited files easily into Puhti (or Rahti, ...) via SSH\n   - For example, an IDE like _Visual Studio Code_ or a text editor like _Notepad++_\n- Follow these [detailed instructions to set them up](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/remote-dev/)\n- Note that [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/webinterface/vscode/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/webinterface/jupyter/) are also available in the Puhti, Mahti and LUMI web interfaces\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd. is responsible for providing IT support and resources, including supercomputers, for scientific research and development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer provided by CSC for computational research and development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another supercomputer provided by CSC, aimed at supporting computational needs in scientific research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is one of the CSC's supercomputers, designed to support a wide range of computational tasks in research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH refers to Secure Shell, a protocol used for secure login and other secure network services over an insecure network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SCP stands for Secure Copy Protocol, a method used for securely transferring files between a local and a remote computer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSYNC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files across computer systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILEZILLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FileZilla is a free software, cross-platform FTP application, consisting of FileZilla Client and FileZilla Server)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINSCP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WinSCP is a free and open-source SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, and SCP client for Microsoft Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MobaXterm is a software that provides a set of Unix command line tools and a graphical interface for Windows computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD.<|>Puhti is one of the supercomputers provided by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd. for scientific research<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD.<|>Mahti is another supercomputer provided by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd., aimed at supporting computational research<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD.<|>LUMI is provided by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd. as part of their computational resources for research<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>PUHTI<|>SSH is used as a secure method for logging into the Puhti supercomputer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>MAHTI<|>SSH protocol is utilized for secure access to the Mahti supercomputer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>LUMI<|>SSH is employed for secure connections to the LUMI supercomputer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCP<|>PUHTI<|>SCP is used for transferring files securely to and from Puhti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSYNC<|>PUHTI<|>Rsync is a tool used for efficient file transfer to Puhti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILEZILLA<|>PUHTI<|>FileZilla can be used as a GUI tool for transferring files to Puhti<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINSCP<|>PUHTI<|>WinSCP is recommended for graphical file transfer to Puhti<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>PUHTI<|>MobaXterm provides both SSH access and a file transfer GUI for Puhti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>PUHTI<|>Visual Studio Code can be set up for remote development on Puhti<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS<|>PUHTI<|>Jupyter Notebooks are available in the Puhti web interface for interactive computing<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
