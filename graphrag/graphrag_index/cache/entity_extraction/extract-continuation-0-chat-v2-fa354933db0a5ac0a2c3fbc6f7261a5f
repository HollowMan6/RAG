Opening a storage bucket for importing data from data producer\n\nOnce you have access to Allas, you can create a new data bucket there and share this bucket with the data producer. \nThis approach requires that the data producer too has a project at CSC. Usually the Finnish academic data producers, \nlike sequencing centers, have a CSC project. You can copy the public key of your project to the shared bucket or \nsent the public key to the data producer by some other means.\n\nWe recommend that you ask the data producer to encrypt your data with _CSC public key_ and \nwith the _key of your project_. This way you can use the data both in your local secure environment \nand in CSC Sensitive Data Services.\n\n### 4.1 Using Puhti to create a shared bucket\n\nIf you know the project number of the data producer, you can easily create a shared Allas \nbucket using `a-tools` commands in _Puhti_. First open terminal connection to `puhti.csc.fi`\n(use SSH, PuTTY, or terminal connection from [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi)).\n\nIn chapter 2.2 we had researcher Tiina Tutkija who created encryption keys and stored them to Allas. \nIn her case a shared bucket could be created with following commands.\n\nFirst Tiina Tutkija opens a connection to Puhti. In a browser, she moves to URL\n[https://puhti.csc.fi](https://puhti.csc.fi) and logs in with her CSC account. Once the web interface of Puhti is open she opens a terminal with tool:\n\n**Tools/Login node shell**\n\nThis tool provides terminal connection to Puhti.\n\nIn the terminal, Tiina activates connection to Allas:\n\n```text\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf\n```\n\nThen she creates a new shared bucket with command:\n\n```text\nmake-shared-bucket\n```\n\nThis tool creates a new bucket and shares it with the collaborator.\nThe command asks first for the name of the bucket to be created. In this\ncase Tiina uses bucket name `animine_data_import_1`.        \n\nThen the command asks for the project that should have access to the bucket.\nThe project name of data producer is in this example `project_2000111`.\n\nThen she downloads the public key to Puhti:\n\n```text\na-get animine_pub/data/animine_crypt4gh.pub\n```\n\nAnd uploads the key to the shared bucket:\n\n```text\na-put animine_crypt4gh.pub -b animine_data_import_1\n```\n\nFinally, Tiina sends the name of the shared bucket to the data producer \nand ask them to encrypt the data to be uploaded with both the public key \nthat they can find from the bucket and the CSC public key.\n\n### 4.2 Revoke bucket sharing after data transport\n\nMoving large datasets (several terabytes) of data to Allas can take a long time. \nAfter few days, data producer tells Tiina that all data has been imported to the shared `animine_data_import_1` bucket in Allas. \nTiina can now remove the external access rights from the bucket with command:\n\n```text\na-access -rw project_2000111 animine_data_import_1\n```\n\n## 5. Using encrypted data \n\nThe data stored to CSC using the procedure above is accessible only to the members of the research group.\nThe data is encrypted with both CSC public key and research group's own public key. If the data is accessed \nthrough [SD Desktop](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi) the decryption of data is done automatically by the _Data Gateway_ \ntool when data is used in the working environment.\n\nIf the data is used in other environments, decryption must be done by the user.\n\nIn SD Connect service the shared bucket, in this example `animine_data_import_1`, needs some preparations before the uploaded data \ncan be downloaded. \n\nFirst, user must share the bucket to her own project too. After that the uploaded data can be accessed, not through the normal data _Browser_ view, but through the _Shared_ view of SD Connect.\n\nIn the example above, researcher _Tiina Tutkija_ shared a data bucket `animine_data_import_1` in Allas service \nto receive data from sequencing center. The sequencing center uploaded file `run_12_R1.fastq.c4gh` to the bucket. \nTiina can now use [SD Connect](https://sd-connect.csc.fi) to download this file to her local computer. \n\n   * First, Tiina checks the _Project Identifier_ string of her project and copies it to the clip board.\n   * Then, on the _Browser_ view of SD Connect she presses the _Share_ button of the bucket (`animine_data_import_1`). This opens the Bucket sharing page. Here, Tiina turns on _read_ and _write_ permissions and adds her Project Identifier (shown in the user information page of SD Connect) to the field: Project Identifiers to share with. The sharing is activated by clicking the Share button.\n   * Next, Tiina moves to the _Shared to the project_ view which now includes bucket `animine_data_import_1`. \n\nShe can now open the bucket and start downloading the data.\n\nHowever, after downloading the file is still in encrypted format. To decrypt the file Tiina opens the _[\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANIMINE_CRYPT4GH.PUB.C4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A public key file used for encryption, stored in Allas data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANIMINE_CRYPT4GH.KEY.C4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A private key file used for decryption, stored in Allas data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANIMINE_KEY_INSTRUCTIONS.TXT.C4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A text file containing instructions for key usage, stored in encrypted format in Allas data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANIMINE_PUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bucket in Allas data storage containing the public key for the project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A data storage service provided by CSC for Finnish academic projects and their collaborators)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Finnish IT center for science, provides computing and data storage services for research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A supercomputer at CSC, used for data-intensive applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIINA TUTKIJA<|>PERSON<|>A researcher who created encryption keys and stored them to Allas, and created a shared bucket for data import)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC service that provides a secure working environment for sensitive data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CSC service for securely downloading and uploading sensitive data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA GATEWAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool in SD Desktop for automatic decryption of data when used in the working environment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANIMINE_PUB<|>ANIMINE_CRYPT4GH.PUB.C4GH<|>The animine_pub bucket contains the public key file animine_crypt4gh.pub<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIINA TUTKIJA<|>ALLAS<|>Tiina Tutkija uses Allas to store encryption keys and create a shared bucket for data import<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIINA TUTKIJA<|>PUHTI<|>Tiina Tutkija uses Puhti to create a shared bucket in Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>DATA GATEWAY<|>SD Desktop uses Data Gateway for automatic decryption of data<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>TIINA TUTKIJA<|>Tiina Tutkija uses SD Connect to download encrypted data to her local computer<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
