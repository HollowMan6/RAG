Client-server-based SQL databases (e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL) can not be effectively run in HPC computing environments like Mahti or Puhti. If you need to use relational databases in CSC computing environment, you should use a database running in some external server.\n\nIt is fairly simple to set up your own SQL server using [Pukki DBaaS](../../cloud/dbaas/index.md), or a Virtual Machine running in cPouta. Setting up your own database server this way gives you full access to the database. Note that using cPouta requires that you know how to manage a database server.\n\n## Kaivos - just add data\n\nAnother option is to use kaivos.csc.fi database service that is hosted by CSC. This service is intended for users who want to use their own MySQL/MariaDB databases in CSC computing environment without managing their own database server. The service is in this sense similar to Pukki DBaaS, which supports PostgreSQL databases.  \n\nIn this guide you can find information about getting started with Kaivos and instructions for using it. The actual SQL command language is not discussed in this document in detail. Please use the MariaDB manual or some of the many SQL guides published for an introduction to SQL databases.\n\n\n**Comparison between Pukki and Kaivos**\n\n|                     | Pukki DBaaS              | Kaivos                    |\n|:--------------------|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n| Database engine     | ProstgreSQL              | MariaDB                   |\n| Accessibility       | Accessibility controlled with <br> firewall settings by the user.<br> Accessible from any location.  | Directly accessible only <br> from Puhti and Mahti. | \n| DB administration   | User                     | CSC                       |\n| Max. size           | 50-200 GB                | 20 GB                     |\n| Backup by CSC       | Yes                      | Yes                       |\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KAIVOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kaivos is a relational database service hosted by CSC, intended for users in the CSC computing environment wanting to use MySQL/MariaDB databases without managing their own server)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pukki DBaaS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pukki DBaaS is a service for setting up SQL servers, specifically supporting PostgreSQL databases, and allows users full access to manage their databases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC hosts the Kaivos database service and provides computing environments like Mahti and Puhti for users)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MySQL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MySQL is a relational database management system that is one of the options for users in the CSC computing environment through Kaivos)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MariaDB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MariaDB is a relational database management system, similar to MySQL, and is supported by the Kaivos service for CSC computing environment users)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PostgreSQL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PostgreSQL is a relational database management system supported by Pukki DBaaS for users needing SQL database services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mahti<|>GEO<|>Mahti is part of the CSC computing environment, mentioned as not suitable for running client-server-based SQL databases directly\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Puhti<|>GEO<|>Puhti is part of the CSC computing environment, mentioned alongside Mahti as not suitable for running client-server-based SQL databases directly\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAIVOS<|>CSC<|>Kaivos is hosted by CSC, providing a database service for CSC computing environment users<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAIVOS<|>MySQL<|>Kaivos supports MySQL databases for users in the CSC computing environment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAIVOS<|>MariaDB<|>Kaivos supports MariaDB databases for users in the CSC computing environment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Pukki DBaaS<|>PostgreSQL<|>Pukki DBaaS supports PostgreSQL databases, offering SQL server setup services<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>Mahti<|>CSC provides the Mahti computing environment, which is mentioned as not suitable for direct SQL database operations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>Puhti<|>CSC provides the Puhti computing environment, which is mentioned as not suitable for direct SQL database operations<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
