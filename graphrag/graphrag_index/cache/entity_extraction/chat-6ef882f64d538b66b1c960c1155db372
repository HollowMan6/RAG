Velveth takes in a number of sequence Ô¨Åles, produces a hashtable, then outputs two files in an output directory, Sequences and Roadmaps, which are necessary to Velvetg. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```bash\nvelveth output_directory hash_length  [[-file_format][-read_type] filename]\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nvelveth assembly_dir 21 -shortPaired data/reads.fa\n```\n\n`velvetg` (and the corresponding colorspace version `velvetg_de`) is the core of Velvet where the de Bruijn graph is built and then manipulated. The syntax of `velvetg` is:\n\n```bash\nvelvetg output_directory -options parameters\n```\n\nA `velvetg` command could look like:\n\n```bash\nvelvetg assembly_dir -cov_cutoff 5 -read_trkg yes -amos_file yes\n```\n \nWhen Velvet was compiled on Puhti, the maximum allowed k-mer length was defined. The longer the maximum k-mer is, the more memory Velvet will need (regardless of the k-mer length that is actually used). Because of that we provide several versions of Velvet, listed in the table below. On Puhti, the default maximum k-mer length that can be used in the hash table is 100 bases. However, it is recommended to use the version that has the shortest possible max k-mer length. For example, for k-mer length 40, you should use `velveth_maxk50` and `velvetg_maxk50`.\n\n### Velvet programs available on Puhti\n\n| Program \t   | max. k-mer length | type |\n|------------------|-------------------|------|\n| `velveth` \t   | 100 \t       |normal|\n| `velvetg` \t   | 100 \t       |normal|\n| `velveth_maxk75`   | 75 \t       |normal|\n| `velvetg_maxk75`   | 75 \t       |normal|\n| `velveth_maxk50`   | 50 \t       |normal|\n| `velvetg_maxk50`   | 50 \t       |normal|\n| `velveth_maxk35`   | 35 \t       |normal|\n| `velvetg_maxk35`   | 35 \t       |normal|\n| `velveth_de` \t   | 100 \t       |colorspace|\n| `velvetg_de` \t   | 100 \t       |colorspace|\n| `velveth_de_maxk75`| 75 \t       |colorspace|\n| `velvetg_de_maxk75`| 75 \t       |colorspace|\n| `velveth_de_maxk50`| 50 \t       |colorspace|\n| `velvetg_de_maxk50`| 50 \t       |colorspace|\n| `velveth_de_maxk35`| 35 \t       |colorspace|\n| `velvetg_de_maxk35`| 35 \t       |colorspace|\n\nOn Puhti, the Velvet jobs should be executed through the batch job system. Below is sample batch job file for Velvet:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=velvet\n#SBATCH --output=put=output_velvet2.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_velvet2.txt\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=4-00:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --partition=longrun\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --mem=64G\n\nmodule load biokit\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\nexport OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n\nvelveth_maxk50 assembly_folder 45 -shortPaired -fastq temp.fastq\nvelvetg_maxk50 assembly_folder -ins_length 400\n```\n\nIn the batch job file above, the job reserves 4 computing cores (`--cpus-per-task=4`) and 64 GB of memory for four days (`--time=4-00:00:00`). Velvet can utilize thread-based parallel computing. After the setup command `module load biokit`, the number of cores to be used in the Velvet run is defined with the environment variables `$OMP_NUM_THREADS` and `$OMP_THREAD_LIMIT`. In this script these variables are set by using the environment variable `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` that contains the value defined with `--cpus-per-task` (which, in this example, has the value 4).\n\nThe batch job can be launched with the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch script_file_name\n```\n\nMore information about running batch jobs can be found from the [batch job section of the Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\n## More information\n\nMore information about Velvet can be found from:\n\n* [Velvet GitHub repository](https://github.com/dzerbino/\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
