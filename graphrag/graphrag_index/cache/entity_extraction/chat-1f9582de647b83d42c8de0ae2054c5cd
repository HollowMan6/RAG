This is to make opening files faster in for example QGIS. QGIS needs to sample for min and max value in the data to be able to set the colorscale right and this takes time with large virtual rasters. To avoid having to do this you can precompute statistics to separate XML file with `gdalinfo --stats` command.\n*   A good trick in QGIS when working with large rasters is to enable raster toolbar (View->Toolbars->Raster Toolbar) This allows you to easily adjust colorscale to area shown in screen which lets you have good contrast regardless of zoom level.\n*   QGIS seems to be pretty good at handling large datasets when above mentioned steps have been taken. Even with 2m DEM from whole finland zooming and moving the map is quite smooth.\n\n## Creating virtual rasters\n\nFollowing tools support creating virtual rasters:\n\n*   [GDAL gdalbuildvrt](https://gdal.org/programs/gdalbuildvrt.html) commandline tool.\n*   GDAL gdal_translate with STAC search\n*   [Python](https://gdal.org/api/python/osgeo.gdal.html#osgeo.gdal.BuildVRT) and [R](https://rdrr.io/cran/terra/man/vrt.html) have wrappers for GDAL gdalbuildvrt, for [longer example for R see StackOverflow's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68332846/improving-computational-speed-of-zonal-statistics-on-150gb-of-raster-tiles-in-r).\n*   [QGIS,](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/gdal/rastermiscellaneous.html?highlight=virtual#build-virtual-raster) [GrassGIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass79/manuals/r.buildvrt.html) and [SagaGIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/saga_tool_doc/7.5.0/io_gdal_12.html) provide graphical interface for gdalbuildvrt\n*   [lidR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/index.html) supports writing lidar data analysis results directly as virtual raster\n* [vrt_creator.py](../../../data/datasets/spatial-data-in-csc-computing-env.md) in Puhti for custom areas with 2m or 10m DEM\n\nIn Puhti glalbuildvrt is included in all [modules including GDAL](../../../apps/gdal.md), Python BuildVRT in [geoconda](../../../apps/geoconda.md), QGIS in [QGIS](../../../apps/qgis.md), R terra and lidR in [r-env](../../../apps/r-env.md) module.\n\n### Creating virtual raster with GDAL gdalbuildvrt\n\nIf your data is divided to subfolders the easiest option is to create the virtual raster with a help of input file list:\n\n`gdalbuildvrt -input_file_list file_list.txt virtual_raster.vrt`\n\nCheck gdalbuildvrt documentation for additional options, for example for setting no-data value.\n\n\n#### Creating the file list for gdalbuildvrt\n\nFile list should include preferably full paths, but for local files also relative paths can be used.\n\n**Linux** \n\n`find /appl/data/geo/mml/dem2m/ -name \"*.**tif**\" > file_list.txt`\n\n**Windows**\n\n`dir \\data\\dem2m\\*.**tif** /S /B > file_list.txt`\n\n**Raster files in Allas / some other S3**\n\nIf doing this from Puhti, load allas module. \n\nList the file names as they are in the bucket with rclone or some other tool:\n\n`rclone lsf --include '*.**tif**' allas:<your_bucket_name > file_list.txt`\n\nNext add to the file list the full paths as they are required by GDAL, using vsicurl, vsis3 or vsiswift drivers. See longer explanations of GDAL drivers and Allas from [Puhti GDAL page](../../../apps/gdal.md).\n\n`sed -i -e 's-^-/**vsicurl**/https://a3s.fi/<your_bucket_name>/-' file_list.txt`\n\n`sed -i -e 's-^-/**vsis3**/<your_bucket_name>/-' file_list.txt`\n\n`sed -i -e 's-^-/**vsiswift**/<your_bucket_name>/-' file_list.txt`\n\nSet up your credentials for [GDAL](../../../apps/gdal.md) before running `gdalbuildvrt`.\n\n### Creating virtual raster from STAC search results\n\nSTAC (Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog) is a way to describe (raster) datasets with support to search data by time and location. For example [Paituli STAC](https://paituli.csc.fi/stac.html) includes several Finnish datasets and explains the STAC concepts in more detail. \n\n[GDAL supports searching STAC](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/stacit.html) and creating virtual rasters based on the results.\n\nFor example following creates virtual raster based on search results from Paituli STAC, the query asks for files in `corine_land_cover_at_geocubes` Collection in specified time interval and location (bbox), based on Assets (=files) with name `COG`. \n\n`gdal_translate \"STACIT:\\\"https://paituli.csc.fi/geoserver/ogc/stac/v1/search?collections=corine_land_cover_at_geocubes&datetime=2017-01-05/2019-02-14&bbox=19.5,61.5,28.7,63.0\\\":\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
