It is a low level CUDA kernel profiling tool. It enables the collection of a timeline of CUDA-related\nactivities on both CPU and GPU, including kernel execution, memory transfers,\nmemory set and CUDA API calls and events or metrics for CUDA kernels.\nProfiling results are displayed in the console after the profiling data is\ncollected, and may also be saved for later viewing by *ncu-ui* tool.\n\nTo use `ncu`, one needs to first load the CUDA module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load cuda\n```\n\nTo profile a CUDA code, one then adds the command `ncu` before the normal\ncommand to execute the code. Running is otherwise similar to that of any other\nCUDA job on [Puhti](running/example-job-scripts-puhti.md#single-gpu) or [Mahti](running/example-job-scripts-mahti.md#1-2-gpu-job-ie-gpusmall-partition).\n\nAn example of usage of `ncu`:\n```\nncu --set full -o myreport ./a.out\n```\nNext the resulted report is analysed with `ncu-ui` on the CSC supercomputers or on the user's local machine. The performance of the program can be compared to the theoretical peak  (`speed-of-light`) performance or to a custom baseline (for example a previous realease to be compared to) can be used.\n\n`ncu` supports many useful running options, it is fully customizable. Use command line arguments `--list metrics`and `--query-metrics` to check the available metrics and enquire which metrics are available for the current platform.
