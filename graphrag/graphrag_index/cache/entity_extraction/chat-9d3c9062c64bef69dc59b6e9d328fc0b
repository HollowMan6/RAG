In most cases a subdirectory in your `/project/project_*`\ndirectory is the best location to install software as that directory is both\npermanent for the duration of your project and shared with all users in your\nproject so that everybody can use the software. It is a great idea to set\nthis environment variable in your `.profile` or `.bashrc`file, e.g.\n\n```bash\nexport EBU_USER_PREFIX=/project/project_465000000/EasyBuild\n```\n\n(replacing 465000000 with the number of your project).\n\n??? Tip \"Tip for users with multiple projects\"\n    If you participate in multiple projects, you'll have to either have only\n    a very personal software setup in your home directory which no one else can\n    use, or a setup in each of the project directories, as sharing of project\n    directories across projects is not possible. Our modules can also support\n    only one user software setup at a time. However, you can always switch to\n    a different setup by changing the value of the `EBU_USER_PREFIX`\n    environment variable, but you should only do so when no modules are loaded,\n    not even the `LUMI` module. Hence, you should always do a\n\n    ``` bash\n    $ module --force purge\n    ```\n    \n    of at the very least\n    \n    ``` bash\n    $ module --force unload LUMI\n    ```\n    \n    immediately before changing the value of `EBU_USER_PREFIX`. If you fail to\n    do so, the old user module directories will not be removed from the module\n    search path, not even if you reload the `LUMI` module, and you may get very\n    unexpected results from module load operations.\n\n??? Failure \"Do not change `EBU_USER_PREFIX` when a `LUMI` module is loaded\"\n    Changing the value of `EBU_USER_PREFIX` while one of the `LUMI` modules\n    is loaded has side effects. When switching to a different version of the\n    `LUMI` module or reloading the current module to enable the new installation\n    directory, the module system will fail to first properly clean the\n    old user installation directories from the module search path, even when\n    using `module --force purge`. This is a side effect of how Lmod works when\n    unloading modules. There is no easy workaround for this.\n\n    However, doing a `module --force unlod LUMI` first and then changing the\n    value of `EBU_USER_PREFIX` and then reloading a `LUMI` module will work.\n\nFrom now on you will also see the software that you have installed yourself for\nthe selected version of the LUMI software stack and partition when you do\n`module avail`. Also, `module spider` will also search those directories.\n\n\n### Step 1: Load the LUMI software stack\n\nThe next step is to ensure that the right version of the software stack is\nloaded. Assume that we want to install software in the `LUMI/23.09` stack, then\none needs to execute\n\n``` bash\n$ module load LUMI/23.09\n```\n\nThis should also automatically load the right `partition module` for the part\nof LUMI you are on, as further detailed on the [software\nstacks][softwarestacks] page.\n\nThough it is technically possible to cross-compile software for a different\npartition, this may not be problem-free. \n\nNot all install scripts that come with software do support cross-compiling and\nas tests may fail when compiling for a CPU with instructions that the host CPU \ndoes not support.\n\nCross-compiling for the GPU nodes is particularly troublesome as the configuration\nstep will not be able to detect the correct GPU type should it try to do so.\n\n### Step 2: Load EasyBuild\n\nThe next step to install software in the directory you have just indicated, is\nto load the `EasyBuild-user` module:\n\n```bash\n$ module load EasyBuild-user\n```\n\nThis will print a line on the screen indicating where software will be installed\nas a confirmation. It will also create the directory structure for the user\nsoftware installation if it does not yet exist, including the structure of the\nuser repository discussed below in the [\"Advanced\nguide\"](#advanced-guide-to-easybuild-on-lumi), section [\"Building your own\nEasyBuild repository\"](#building-your-own-easybuild-repository). If you want\nmore information about the full configuration of EasyBuild, you can execute\n\n```bash\n$ eb --show-config\n```\n\nEasyBuild is configured so that it searches in the user repository and two\nrepositories on the system. The current directory is not part of the default\nsearch path but can be easily added with a command line option. By default,\nEasyBuild will not install dependencies of a package and fail instead, if one or\nmore of the dependencies\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
