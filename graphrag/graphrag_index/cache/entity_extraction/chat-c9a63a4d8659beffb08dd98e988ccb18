Don't hesitate to [contact CSC Service Desk](../contact.md) if\n    you're unsure about any aspect of your workflow.\n\nGROMACS comes with a built-in `multidir` functionality, which allows users to run\nmultiple concurrent simulations within one Slurm allocation. This is an excellent\noption for high-throughput use cases, where the aim is to run several similar, but\nindependent, jobs. Notably, multiple calls of `sbatch` or `srun` are not needed,\nwhich decreases the load on the batch queue system. Please consider this option if\nyou're running high-throughput workflows or enhanced sampling jobs such as replica\nexchange or free energy simulations using ensemble-based distance or orientation\nrestraints.\n\nAnother utility of `multidir` is that it can be used to increase the parallel\nefficiency of small systems. By launching multiple trajectories per GPU (or CPU\nnode), the combined throughput of each independent simulation will increase due\nto better resource utilization. This is especially useful for maximizing the\nperformance of small systems on LUMI-G, as well on Mahti where only full CPU\nnodes can be reserved.\n\n## Example batch script for Mahti\n\nThis example adapts the production part of the [lysozyme tutorial](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/)\nby considering 8 similar copies of the system that have been equilibrated with different velocity\ninitializations. Inputs corresponding to each copy are named identically `md_0_1.tpr`\nand placed in subdirectories `run*` as illustrated below by the output of the `tree`\ncommand.\n\n```console\n$ tree\n.\n├── multidir.sh\n├── run1\n│   └── md_0_1.tpr\n├── run2\n│   └── md_0_1.tpr\n├── run3\n│   └── md_0_1.tpr\n├── run4\n│   └── md_0_1.tpr\n├── run5\n│   └── md_0_1.tpr\n├── run6\n│   └── md_0_1.tpr\n├── run7\n│   └── md_0_1.tpr\n└── run8\n    └── md_0_1.tpr\n```\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=00:30:00\n#SBATCH --partition=medium\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n\n# this script runs a 128 core gromacs multidir job (8 simulations, 16 cores per simulation)\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load gromacs-env\n\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n\nsrun gmx_mpi mdrun -multidir run* -s md_0_1.tpr -dlb yes\n```\n\nBy issuing `sbatch multidir.sh` in the parent directory, all simulations are run concurrently\nusing one full Mahti node without hyperthreading so that each system is allocated 16 cores.\nAs the systems were initialized with different velocities, we obtain 8 distinct trajectories\nand an improved sampling of the phase space (see RMSD analysis below). This is a great way\nto accelerate sampling if your system does not scale to a full Mahti node.\n\n![Root-mean-squared-deviations of the simulated replicas](../../img/multidir-rmsd.svg 'Root-mean-squared-deviations of the simulated replicas')\n\n## Example batch script for LUMI\n\nMedium-sized and large systems (few 100k–1M+ atoms) are typically able to utilize multiple\nGPUs on LUMI efficiently. Many smaller use cases run also well on a single GCD (half a GPU),\nbut the smaller the system gets, the poorer it will be able to utilize the full capacity\nof the accelerator.\n\nThe `multidir` feature can be used to increase the GPU utilization of small systems by\nrunning multiple trajectories per GCD. Below is an example batch script that launches\n4 trajectories per GCD in a resource allocation of two GPU nodes (16 GCDs). Each of the\n64 `.tpr` files are organized into separate directories `run1` through `run64`, similar\nto the Mahti example above.\n\n```bash\n!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=standard-g\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=32\n\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule load gromacs/2024.3-gpu\n\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n\nexport MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1\nexport GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM=1\nexport GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI=1\n\ncat << EOF > select_gpu\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\\$((SLURM_LOCALID%SLURM_GPUS_PER_NODE))\nexec \\$*\nEOF\n\nchmod +x ./select_gpu\n\nCPU_BIND=\"mask_cpu:fe000000000000,fe00000000000000\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe0000,fe000000\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe,fe00\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe00000000,fe0000000000\"\n\nsrun --cpu-bind=${CPU_BIND} ./\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
