Knowing about these different states in Pouta \nhelps you make better decisions on how to maintain your infrastructure.\nThis also helps you to save billing units. \n\n## States\n\nThe main states of virtual machines in Pouta:\n\n### Active\nA virtual machine is said to be active when it\nis in the *power on* state. It remains in the active state\nirrespective of whether you are using it or not. Virtual machines in\nthe active state consume computing resources on one of our compute\nnodes and are thus billed normally as explained in [Pouta flavors and billing](vm-flavors-and-billing.md).\n\n### Shut off\nThe virtual machine is not running and is *powered\noff*. However, a shut off virtual machine still consumes billing\nunits in the same way as an **active** one. This is\nbecause active/powered off virtual machines consume the same computing\nresources on one of our compute nodes as explained in [Pouta flavors and billing](vm-flavors-and-billing.md).\n\n!!! warning\n\n    A *shut off* virtual machine still consumes billing units. To stop\n    consuming, select the *shelved* state.\n\n### Pause\nPausing a virtual machine pauses all processes running\nin the virtual machine and saves the entire state of the machine\n(memory, application state etc.) on the host compute node. You are\nnot able to access your virtual machine or hosted applications when\nthe virtual machine is in a *paused* state. Some applications may\nsuffer from side effects when  paused, thus this sate is not\nrecommended for production systems. Some legacy computational tasks\nmay benefit from the paused state but modern workflows generally do\nnot use this state. Pausing a virtual machine is billed in the same\nway as an **active** state virtual machine.\n\n### Suspend\nSuspending a virtual machine saves its current state on\nthe virtual machine's host compute node. The virtual machine can be\nresumed in the same state as it was before the suspension, but\ncompute resources (actual cores, compute nodes etc.) may be different\nfrom the ones before suspending the virtual machine. You\nare not able to access your machine when it is in the *suspended* state.\nVirtual machines in the suspended state are billed in the same way\nas **active** state virtual machines. Suspending is not generally used\nin modern workflows.\n\n### Shelved\nShelving means shutting down a virtual machine and removing it from the host compute node. \nThis frees up the computing resources that were reserved for the virtual machine. \nHowever, the state of all other associated resources, for example the file system,\nfloating IPs, network configuration, etc., is saved in our central storage. \nPlease note that shelving a virtual machine will **not** reduce the amount of\nresources used by the project, only the billing for that virtual machine will stop.\n\nShelving works best for the standard flavors that are already backed by our \ncentral storage service. Shelving can be slow for flavors that are using local storage,\nespecially bigger flavors since the data needs to be copied between the local and \ncentral storage. On a rare occasion, if all of our compute resources are used up, \nwe may not be able to unshelve your virtual machine until another user frees up \ncompute resources. N.B. that your floating IPs, volumes etc. cannot be removed from\nthe virtual machine before it has been unshelved. If you have a floating IP quota\nof two and one of them is attached to a shelved virtual machine, you have only one left. \n**Note** that the ephemeral storage in the IO, or TB flavors is **not** shelved.\n\n\n### Terminate\nTermination (or deletion) removes the virtual machine\nfrom your project and frees up the compute resources that were in\nuse. They cannot be recovered, and all data stored in the virtual\nmachine is deleted, excluding any attached volumes. Once the virtual\nmachine is deleted, you are no longer billed for it.\n\n## Save Your billing units\n\nThe figure below illustrates the state transitions between\nstates.\n\n![Virtual machine lifecycle](../../img/instance-lifecycle-1.png)\n\nIn the above section, we discussed the main states of virtual\nmachines in Pouta. Theoretically, there are other states as well.\nThe full list of states and their behaviors: [OpenStack documentation](https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/server_concepts.html).\n\nIn order to transition between states, you have two main options, use the [Command line client tools](command-line-tools.md), or use the webinterface.\nFrom the web interface you can transition your VM to all these states. In the main page of the Pouta web interface, open the **Instances** view. Under the **Actions** column, you will be able to see a drop-down menu with all the possible options.\n\n![Save your billing units](../../img/Save-Your-billing-units.png)\n\nThere are many other practices which help save billing units:\n\n### Automated provisioning\nAutomated provisioning and configuration\nof your virtual machines helps save billing units. For\nexample, you can tear down your unused virtual machines with automatic\nprovisioning and configuration when you no longer need them. Later when\nyou need them again, you can provision new virtual machines from\nscratch. Your data should always be stored on a volume, and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>POUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta provides cloud services, including virtual machines with a lifecycle that impacts billing and resource usage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Virtual machines in Pouta have various states such as active, shut off, paused, suspended, shelved, and terminated, each affecting resource usage and billing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenStack documentation provides a full list of virtual machine states and behaviors)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>POUTA<|>Virtual machines are a service provided by Pouta, with different states affecting how they are billed and use resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>The behaviors and states of virtual machines in Pouta are documented in OpenStack<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
