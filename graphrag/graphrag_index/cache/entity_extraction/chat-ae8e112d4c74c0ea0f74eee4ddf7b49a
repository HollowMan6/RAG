{"result": "(\"entity\"<|>XHMM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>XHMM is a C++ software suite designed for calling copy number variation (CNV) from next-generation sequencing projects, specifically using exome capture or targeted sequencing. It employs principal component analysis (PCA) normalization and a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect and genotype CNVs from normalized read-depth data.
