Here, a brief overview is given.\nAdditional details and some diagnostics tips are explained in our [Maestro power usage\ntutorial](../support/tutorials/power-maestro.md). See also the video below.\n\nFirst, you need to [get a CSC account](../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md)\nand apply for [access to Puhti](../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md).\nBefore you start the actual workflow below, you need to set up your Maestro environment\non Puhti.\n\nThese first four steps you only need to do once:\n\n1. SSH to Puhti\n     * `ssh <your username>@puhti.csc.fi`\n2. Initialize Maestro with `module load maestro`\n     * Make sure you use the same version as on your local computer\n3. An error may appear on your screen. If it asks you to run a script to generate the hosts file,\n   run it (copy paste it to the command line)\n     * Now you have your own `schrodinger.hosts` file in your `$HOME` directory\n4. Copy the HOST descriptions from the `schrodinger.hosts` file on Puhti to your local hosts\n   file on your computer\n     * Copy everything starting from `name: test` and paste it at the end of your local\n       `schrodinger.hosts` file\n     * This step may need administrator privileges\n\nFor actual simulations we recommend using Puhti as follows:\n\n1. Set up your simulations on your local computer\n2. Write the GUI-generated input files to disk\n3. Copy them to Puhti with e.g. [`scp`](../data/moving/scp.md) or through the\n   [Puhti web interface](../computing/webinterface/index.md)\n4. If needed, edit the submission script (`your-jobname.sh`)\n5. Run the script on the Puhti command line to submit the jobs to the queuing system\n6. Copy the results back for analysis\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n\n    Maestro jobs are not run via batch scripts like most other applications at CSC, but\n    via Schrödinger binaries using options.\n\nFor example, a Desmond workflow could be run with the script:\n\n```bash\n\"${SCHRODINGER}/utilities/multisim\" -JOBNAME 2hhb_test -HOST gputest  \\\n-maxjob 1 -cpu 1 -m 2hhb_test.msj -c 2hhb_test.cfg -description \"Molecular Dynamics\" \\\n2hhb_test.cms -mode umbrella -set stage[1].set_family.md.jlaunch_opt=[\"-gpu\"] \\\n-o 2hhb_test-out.cms -lic \"DESMOND_GPGPU:16 -set \"stage[1].set_family.md.jlaunch_opt=[\"\\-LOCAL\\\"]\" \\\n-LOCAL\"\n```\n\nThe scripts tend to be somewhat complicated, so it's best to write them out from the\nMaestro GUI as explained above. Please also have a look at the [additional flags we\nrecommend to use](../support/tutorials/power-maestro.md).\n\nTo submit such a script in Puhti, you need to first load Maestro and then run the script\n\n```bash\nmodule load maestro\nbash your_script_name.sh\n```\n\n!!! warning \"Maestro GUI\"\n\n    We do **not** recommend running the Maestro GUI remotely on Puhti. It *can* be done via\n    [the Puhti web interface remote desktop](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md), but\n    the performance may be somewhat slow and submitted jobs may end up fizzled. Also,\n    **no long/heavy tasks** should be done on the login nodes. Please consult the\n    [Usage policy](../../computing/usage-policy) page for more details.\n\n!!! info \"Note for Windows users\"\n\n    **Windows** users may need to edit the script created by the GUI a little.\n    Replace the backslashes `\\` with `/` in the path to the Maestro binary\n    (right after `$SCHRODINGER` in the script).\n\n#### Video: How to run a Desmond simulation on Puhti\n\nThe following tutorial video walks you through the process:\n\n[![Maestro Standalone](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Aj205UDcWFE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj205UDcWFE \"Maestro Standalone\")\n\n## References\n\nPlease cite the Maestro modules in all published work as described\nin the Module manuals.
