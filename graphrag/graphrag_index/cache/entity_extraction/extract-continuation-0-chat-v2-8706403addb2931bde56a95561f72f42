This leaves the instance in\n    the suspended state. To work around this issue, we recommend the users\n    power off their VM before taking a snapshot.**\n-   Child instances launched using the snapshot of an existing parent\n    instance do not have a security group predefined. \n    Please select the appropriate security group for\n    child instances before launching them.\n-   Resizing inside a flavor family (within standard.\\*) is\n    possible  except for IO flavors. Resizing between flavor\n    families mostly does not work because of the different storage\n    backends. If you use a volume for the root disk, some resizes\n    between flavor families do work. If you use a image for the root disk,\n    it is possibly dangerous. Always test resizes with an expendable VM you\n    first. If your virtual machines end up in an \"error\"\n    state, please contact us.\n-   Network: It is possible to add the same floating IP to multiple\n    instances using the API. There is no warning or error. The last\n    API call is the one which takes effect.\n-   Volumes: There is no guarantee that device names will get the same\n    name after a rebuild or reboot. If you want to be sure that the\n    correct device gets mounted to the same path every time it is a good\n    idea to use UUIDs instead of paths.\n-   Ubuntu-20.04 images and hpc.6 flavor are unable to boot. A bug prevents\n    instances with Ubuntu 20.04 (created or updated) and flavor hpc.6.*\n    from booting. We expect a future update to fix this, but in the meantime\n    avoid this combination.\n\n## EC2 tools (euca2ools)\n\n\n-   EC2 is presently not supported. EC2 credentials can, however, be\n    used with the object storage.\n\n## [Pouta FAQ entries](../../../support/faq/#pouta)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Virtual Machines that users operate, which can have issues like being left in a suspended state after snapshot failures or entering an error state after resizing attempts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURITY GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of IP filter rules that define how to handle incoming and outgoing traffic to instances; important for child instances launched from snapshots)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLAVOR FAMILY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Categories of VM configurations within which resizing is possible, except for IO flavors, indicating different storage backends and capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IO FLAVORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific category of VM configurations where resizing is not possible, indicating specialized input/output capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the capability within the system to manage IP addresses, including issues like adding the same floating IP to multiple instances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLUMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Storage units attached to VMs, which may not retain the same device names across rebuilds or reboots, suggesting the use of UUIDs for consistency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU-20.04<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific operating system image that, when used with certain VM flavors, encounters boot issues due to a bug)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HPC.6 FLAVOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific configuration of VM that, when combined with Ubuntu 20.04 images, fails to boot due to a known bug)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EC2 TOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tools for managing cloud resources, specifically mentioned here as not supported, though EC2 credentials can be used with object storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pouta FAQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A resource section providing answers and solutions to common issues and questions regarding the use of the cloud service)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VM<|>SECURITY GROUP<|>Child instances launched from VM snapshots require manual security group configuration<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLAVOR FAMILY<|>IO FLAVORS<|>Resizing within flavor families is possible except for IO flavors due to different capabilities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETWORK<|>VM<|>The network system allows the same floating IP to be assigned to multiple VMs, affecting network configuration<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLUMES<|>VM<|>Volumes attached to VMs may not retain consistent device names after rebuilds or reboots, affecting VM storage configuration<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UBUNTU-20.04<|>HPC.6 FLAVOR<|>Combining Ubuntu 20.04 images with HPC.6 flavor causes boot issues due to a bug<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EC2 TOOLS<|>Pouta FAQ<|>EC2 tools are not supported, as mentioned in the Pouta FAQ, but EC2 credentials can be used with object storage<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
