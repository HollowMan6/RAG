Running these on the login node poses several issues and running on Pouta brings administration overhead. Rahti 2 is a good candidate, but one obstacle is that Rahti 2 does not support non-HTTP traffic from external sources.\n\nA workaround for this problem is to establish a TCP tunnel over an HTTP-compatible WebSocket connection. This can be achieved using a command-line client for connecting to and serving WebSockets called [WebSocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat). Here, a WebSocat instance running on Puhti/Mahti translates a database request coming from a workflow to an HTTP-compatible WebSocket protocol. Once the traffic enters Rahti 2 we use another WebSocat instance running inside Rahti 2 to translate back the WebSocket connection to a TCP connection over the original port the database is configured to receive traffic. A drawing of the process is shown below.\n\n![Image illustrating a WebSocket connection bridging CSC's HPC environment and a database service on Rahti](../../img/websocat-diagram-4.drawio.png)\n\nThis tutorial outlines the steps to achieve this using MariaDB as an example database.\n\n!!! info\n\n    The OpenShift template used below to configure WebSocat on Rahti 2 is an unsupported beta version!\n\n!!! info\n\n    This solution is suitable for computationally light use cases. Reasonable scaling can be expected for up to ~100 processes simultaneously accessing a database on Rahti 2. Exceeding this limit is not advised and may result in performance degradation.\n\n## Step 1: Setting up MariaDB and WebSocat on Rahti 2\n\nConfiguring MariaDB and WebSocat on Rahti 2 can be done either through the web interface or using the `oc` command line tool. Notice that your CSC project must have access to the Rahti 2 service. See here [how to add service access for a project](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md).\n\n!!! info\n\n    Mind the difference between [persistent](../rahti2/storage/index.md#persistent-storage) and [ephemeral storage](../rahti2/storage/index.md#ephemeral-storage) when creating a new database in Rahti 2. Ephemeral databases are meant for temporary storage and should not be considered reliable. If the [Pod](../rahti2/networking.md#pods) in which your database is running is deleted or restarted you will lose all your data! To avoid this, create a database with a persistent volume and make sure to also perform regular backups to for example [Allas](../../data/Allas/index.md).\n\n### Option 1: Using the Rahti 2 web interface\n\n- Log in to the [Rahti 2 web interface](https://rahti.csc.fi/). See [Getting access](../rahti2/access.md) for instructions.\n- Deploy MariaDB from the \"Developer Catalog\". You will find the developer catalog in the **+Add** section of the `Developer` menu.\n- Configure the database. You need to at least select or create a Rahti 2 project to which you want to add the database. If creating a new project, make sure to include your CSC project number in the project description in the form `csc_project: 2001234`\n- Create the database and remember the\n    - Connection Username\n    - Connection Password\n    - Root Password\n    - Database name (`sampledb` by default)\n    - Database service name (`mariadb` by default)\n- After creation, double check the network parameters and remember them:\n    - Target port (3306 by default)\n    - Hostname address (of the form `<service name>.<project name>.svc`)\n- An [OpenShift template](https://github.com/CSCfi/websocat-template/blob/main/websocat-template.yaml) is needed to configure WebSocat on Rahti 2. Download or copy this YAML file to your clipboard. **Note:** that this is an _unsupported_ beta template\n- Click in the `+` sign in the upper right corner of the webinterface, and paste the template. Click create.\n- Come back to the \"Developer Catalog\" and deploy the Websocat template. You need to provide the \"Database service name\" (`mariadb` by default) and the \"Database port\" (`3306` by default).\n- In the `Developer` menu, go to **Project -> Route** and copy the Location URL. You will use this URL to connect from outside Rahti 2.\n\n### Option 2: Using the `oc` command line tool\n\n- See [Command line tool usage](../rahti2/usage/cli.md) for basic instructions\n- Login using your CSC username and password\n\n```bash\noc login https://api.2.rahti.csc.fi:6443 -u <username> -p <password>\n```\n\n- Create a new project (namespace) or switch to existing one. If creating a new project, make sure to include your CSC project number in the project description in the form `csc_project: 2001234`\n\n```bash\noc new-project <project name> --display-name='My new project'\\\n   --description='csc_project: <project number>'\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\noc project <project name>\n```\n\n- Add MariaDB by launching the `mariadb-persistent` template. Remember the username, password, database name and the database service name. Use the `-p` flag to modify default parameters\n\n```bash\noc new-app --template=mariadb-persistent\n```\n\n- Add WebSocat by launching the [\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 2 is a service that supports database hosting and is part of CSC's cloud offerings, but it does not support non-HTTP traffic from external sources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides supercomputing resources and services, including Rahti 2 and Pouta for HPC workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta is a cloud service provided by CSC, mentioned as having administration overhead for running databases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBSOCAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WebSocat is a command-line client used for connecting to and serving WebSockets, facilitating TCP tunnels over HTTP-compatible WebSocket connections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI/MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti and Mahti are part of CSC's supercomputing infrastructure, used here for running WebSocat instances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARIADB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MariaDB is an example database used in the tutorial for setting up databases on Rahti 2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenShift is a container application platform that Rahti 2 uses, mentioned in the context of configuring WebSocat on Rahti 2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>CSC<|>Rahti 2 is a service provided by CSC for hosting databases and other applications<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEBSOCAT<|>RAHTI 2<|>WebSocat is used to establish a TCP tunnel over WebSocket to connect to Rahti 2<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEBSOCAT<|>PUHTI/MAHTI<|>WebSocat instances run on Puhti/Mahti to translate database requests to Rahti 2<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIADB<|>RAHTI 2<|>MariaDB is used as an example for setting up databases on Rahti 2<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>RAHTI 2<|>Rahti 2 uses OpenShift for configuring services like WebSocat<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
