This document shows one example how you can combine these two services by mounting a bucket from Allas to an Ubuntu 22.04 (also tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and 18.04) or a Centos7 based virtual machine running in cPouta.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Installing OpenStack, s3cmd and s3fs\n\n### In Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (works for Ubuntu 20.04 and 18.04 as well)\n\n* After launching an Ubuntu based virtual machine in cPouta, open a terminal connection to the VM and update it with the command:\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo apt update\n\t```\n\n!!! warning\n    Older versions of Ubuntu will have older and deprecated versions of python. It is recommended to use the latest Ubuntu version available in Pouta.\n\n* Then install OpenStack client by:\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev python3-setuptools\n\tsudo pip install --upgrade pip\n\tsudo pip install python-openstackclient\n\t```\n\n\t!!! info\n\t\tFor Ubuntu 18.04, type those commands:  \n\t\t```sh\n\t\tsudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev python3-setuptools\n\t\tsudo pip3 install --upgrade pip\n\t\tsudo pip install python-openstackclient --ignore-installed PyYAML\n\t\t```\n\t\t\n\t\tIf you omit `--ignore-installed PyYAML`, you will receive an error message:  \n\t\t```\n\t\tCannot uninstall 'PyYAML'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.\n\t\t```\n\t\tIt should be installed by **distutils**, so the removal process cannot confirm which files belong to it.\n\n* Next, install  **s3cmd** and **s3fs** commands to your VM.\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo apt install s3cmd s3fs\n\t```\n\n### In Centos7 (Maintenance Updates EOL 2024-06-30)\n\n* After launching a Centos7 based virtual machine in cPouta, open a terminal connection to the VM and update it with the command:\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo yum update\n\t```\n\n* OpenStack and s3cmd can then be installed by:\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo yum install python3 python3-devel wget\n\tsudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n\tsudo python3 -m pip install python-openstackclient\n\tsudo yum install s3cmd\n\t```\n\n* s3fs-fuse can be installed using this command:\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo yum install s3fs-fuse\n\t```\n\n## Configuring and using Allas\n\n### Use s3cmd to read and write files\n\nOnce you have openstack, s3cmd and s3fs installed, download and execute the **poutaos_configure** tool to configure _s3cmd_ so that it uses your cPouta project. You can also use this tool to switch between different Allas projects \nif you have several of them.\n\n```\nwget https://a3s.fi/tools/poutaos_configure\nchmod u+x poutaos_configure\n./poutaos_configure\n```\n\nThe _poutaos_configure_ will first ask you for your CSC username and password, you can see which is your CSC username in your [My CSC profile](https://my.csc.fi/profile) page, you csan also change your password there. Then it will list your Allas projects and ask you to fill up the project to be used. Finally it will ask you for the **chunk size**, it is recommended to leave the default.\n\nAfter this you can use the storage area of your Allas project with _s3cmd_ commands. Now you can see, download and upload files in this bucket with _s3cmd_.\n\n* List all your buckets:\n\n```sh\n$ s3cmd ls s3://\n2022-10-17 07:03  s3://data-europe\n2020-09-17 11:12  s3://images-sky\n2020-11-06 13:56  s3://case_1\n```\n\n* Let's assume you already have a bucket called **case_1** in Allas and that you have some data objects (i.e. files) in this bucket.\n\n```sh\n$ s3cmd ls s3://case_1\n2022-10-17 07:14     67213268  s3://case_1/file1.txt\n```\n\n* To retrieve the file:\n\n```sh\ns3cmd get s3://case_1/file1.txt\n```\n\n* To upload a new file:\n\n```sh\ns3cmd put file2.txt s3://case_1/\n```\n\nThis is the **recommended way** to use Allas with the S3 protocol from the command line. However, it is also possible to mount the bucket to your VM so that it is shown as  \"mounted disk\". You can use `s3fs` for that.\n\n### Use s3fs to mount a folder into your VM\n\n\n1. To do this, create first an empty directory (like **os_case_1**) to be used as a mount point:\n\n\t```sh\n\tmkdir os_case_1\n\t```\n\n\t!!! info\n\t    Any empty directory can be used as a mount point\n\n1. Create a `.passwd-s3fs` file in your home\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
