The port used by TurboVNC server is shown when TurboVNC starts: _TurboVNC started on display **name-of-VM:1**_ (name-of-VM is the instance name you have given to your virtual machine, and TurboVNC server uses the first available port). For your local PC, choose a port that is not in use already, say 5911. After the SSH tunnel is established, start your local TurboVNC viewer at the local port. See the examples below (note that other distros use *cloud-user* instead of *ubuntu* as the default username).\n\n**Linux/Mac:**  \nfill in your _vncviewer_ path, the ip number of your VM, its name, and the location and name of your key pair file. Type your TurboVNC password when prompted.\n\n```\npath/vncviewer -via ubuntu@ip-number-of-VM name-of-VM:1 -i path/private-key-file.pem\n```\n\n  \n**Windows PC, at command prompt:**  \nfill in your PuTTY path (PuTTY comes with TurboVNC, and the default path is used in this example), fill in the name of your VM, its ip number, and the location and name of your key pair file\n\n```\n\"c:\\\\program files\\\\turbovnc\\\\putty.exe\" -L 5911:name-of-VM:5901 ubuntu@ip-number-of-VM -i path\\\\private-key-file.ppk\n```\n\n**Windows PC, using PuTTY's graphical interface:**  \ntype the location of your key-pair file to _Private key file for authentication_ box in the _Auth_ panel of the PuTTY configuration box. Also fill in the source and destination ports ports, in the category _Connection_\\-_SSH_\\-_Tunnels_, _Source port:_ 5911, _Destination:_ name-of-VM:5901 (remember to click the _Add_ button). Save the session profile for further use.\n\nAfter the SSH tunnel is established, open your TurboVNC viewer client. When _New TurboVNC Connection_ window opens, fill in localhost:11, click _Connect_, and type your TurboVNC password when prompted.\n\n  \n**All platforms:**  \nAfter the TurboVNC password is accepted, an empty VNC window opens. Right-click to open a terminal. Remember to **start your apps with vglrun** command. For example, to run OpenGL test app glxspheres64, type\n\n```\nvglrun /opt/VirtualGL/bin/glxspheres64\n```\n\nWhen you have finished, close the VNC window by clicking the _X_ button either on the menu bar (_Disconnect_) or the top-right window corner. Do not right click the desktop and choose _exit_, since this closes the Openbox windows manager (see **Known issues** below).\n\n  \n## Useful commands\n\nFind out TurboVNC server display number and process ID\n\n```\n/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -list\n```\n\nClose TurboVNC server running at display 1\n\n```\n/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -kill :1\n```\n\nCheck if X server is running\n\n```\nps auxw | grep X\n```\n\nStop X server\n\n```\nsudo killall X (CentOS)\nsudo killall Xorg (Ubuntu)\n```\n\nFind out glibc, NVIDIA driver versions\n\n```\nldd --version\nnvidia-smi\n```\n\nUninstall NVIDIA driver (for example 450.51.06)\n\n```\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.51.06.run --uninstall\n```\n\nNVIDIA readme-file is located at _/usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README.txt_\n\n## Known issues\n\nIf you exit TurboVNC viewer window by right-clicking and choosing _exit_, Openbox windows manager will shut off. To start Openbox, close and restart your TurboVNC server as instructed above.\n\nSome applications require additional packages to run properly. For example, in Ubuntu installation, ParaView needs an extra package\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install libxcb-keysyms1\n```\n\nand in CentOS\n\n```\nsudo yum install xcb-util-keysyms\n```\n\n  \n##CentOS installation\n----------------------\n\nAfter launching a CentOS-7 image, update package lists, install X server, fonts, and Openbox windows manager\n\n```\nyum check-update\nsudo yum install xorg-x11-xauth xorg-x11-server-Xorg dejavu-sans-fonts xterm openbox\n```\n\nInstall linux kernel sources needed for NVIDIA driver compilation to work\n\n```\nsudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) gcc\n```\n\nDownload NVIDIA driver (say version 450.51.06) install script\n\n```\nsudo wget http://uk.download.nvidia.com/tesla/450.51.06/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.51.06.run\n```\n\nRun the script. Suggested answers: **No** to _register the kernel module sources with DKMS_, and **No** to _Install NVIDIA's 32-bit compatibility libraries_. Ignore warnings.\n\n```\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.51.06.run\n```\n\nConfigure X for the NVIDIA driver with **nvidia-xconfig** tool. It will find out the card's BusID address\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
