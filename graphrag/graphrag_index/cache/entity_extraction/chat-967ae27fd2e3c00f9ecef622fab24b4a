Open up the side menu from the\nrightward pointing arrow. In this example, we are opening the side menu for\nproject 462000008, for which we will create the authentication key pair for.\n\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src=\"../../../assets/images/auth.lumidata.eu-main-page-select-project.png\"\n    width=\"720\"\n    alt=\"Screenshot of auth.lumidata.eu side menu arrow\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Open the side menu</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe side menu allows for the creation of access keys. To generate an access key\n\"Duration (hours)*\" and \"Key description*\" fields must be filled out.\n\n!!! tip\n    A good practice is to set the authentication key pair duration for the job\n    walltime. This lets the job move the necessary data from LUMI-O to the\n    scratch filesystem, perform the necessary calculations, and after finishing\n    move the data back to LUMI-O.\n\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src=\"../../../assets/images/auth.lumidata.eu-create-the-first-key.png\"\n    width=\"720\" alt=\"Screenshot of auth.lumidata.eu side menu content\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Side menu</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWhen filling out the duration, keep the previous advice in mind.\n\n!!! tip\n    The key description should be something relevant to the job it is meant for,\n    that way it is easier to manage the created keys, should there be more than\n    a few at the same time.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/auth.lumisade.eu-key-duration-and-hours.png\"\n    width=\"720\"\n    alt=\"Screenshot of auth.lumidata.eu setting duration and description\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Filling out the required fields</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAfter the necessary fields are created, click on \"Generate key\".\nThe generated key will appear in the side menu under \"Available keys\".\nThe previously mentioned key description field is visible there,\nwhich makes it easy to distinguish between several keys.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/auth.lumidata.eu-first-access-key.png\"\n    width=\"720\" alt=\"Screenshot of auth.lumidata.eu available keys\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Available keys</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nClick on the newly generated Access key. This opens up the key's content. It\nprovides the necessary \"Access key\" and \"Secret key\". You can also see the key\ndescription, which project said key is related to, owner of the key and finally\nCreation and Expiry dates.\n\nFrom this side menu, it is also possible to extend the key.\n\n!!! info\n\tWhen you initially create the key, the initial allowed maximum lifetime is 168h = 7 days.\n\tThis can then be extended by one hour for every hour from key creation,\n    i.e., you are always able to extend the duration of the key to now + 7 days.\n\nDownloading a configuration template for different object storage clients like\nshell, boto3, rclone, s3cmd and aws.\n\nAfter selecting the desired object storage client and clicking \"Generate\"\nopens the output in a new browser tab.\n\nFinally, by scrolling down in the menu this side menu allows you to delete the\nkey. After deletion of a key, a new one needs to be created to resume\nutilizing LUMI-O for a certain project. Keys are non-recoverable, but a new one\ncan be created in its place.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/auth.lumisade.eu-first-key-content.png\"\n    width=\"720\" alt=\"Screenshot of auth.lumidata.eu access key details\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Access key details</figcaption>\n</figure>\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
