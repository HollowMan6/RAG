The dashboard also contains some important system information.\n\n## Available features\n\n### Shell\n\nThe shell apps can be found under Pinned apps or on the top navbar under the _Tools_ section.\nThere are two different shells.\n\nThe _Login node shell_ launches a normal Linux shell on one of the login nodes.\nAny command running when the login shell browser tab is closed will stop.\nNote that the same rules apply here as during a normal ssh session from a terminal.\n**Login nodes are only for light pre/postprocessing**. \n\n![Interactive login shell](../../assets/images/wwwLumiShell.png)\n\nThe _Compute node shell_ launches a persistent shell on a compute node for heavier commands that should not be run on login nodes.\nThe persistent shell will keep running even if you close your browser or lose internet connection.\n\n### Files\n\nThe file browser can be opened using the _Files_ section on the top navbar (this displays a list of all project disk areas), or using \nthe shortcut to the home folder on the front page. In the file browser\nyou can upload/download files, create new files and directories, or open a shell in the current directory. \n\n!!! note\n    Uploaded files will overwrite existing files with the same name without prompting.\n    Currently, the maximum size for individual file uploads is 10GB.\n    Keep the tab with the file browser open while file transfers are in progress to ensure that they complete successfully.\n\n\n![File browser view](../../assets/images/wwwLumiFiles.png)\n\nClicking on a file will open it in a view-only mode. For more options like editing, renaming and deleting, use the button with three dots next to the filename.   \n\nThe file browser comes with a basic text editor. Some important notes on that:\n\n- If no changes have been made, the _save_ button is grayed out.\n- There is no _save-as_ feature, so read-only files cannot be edited.\n\n#### Accessing LUMI-O\n[LUMI-O](../../storage/lumio/#lumi-o) can also be accessed if you have\nconfigured the connection, which you can do using the Cloud storage\nconfiguration app, found in the _Pinned apps_ or the _Tools_ dropdown in the\nnavbar. After configuring the connections, also known as remotes, you can find\nthem in the _Files_ dropdown in the navbar or in the files browser.\n\nThe Cloud storage configuration app will configure a private remote,\n`lumi-<project number>-private`, and a public remote, `<lumi-project\nnumber>-public>`, if you have enabled the option. Note that files uploaded to\nthe public remote will be publicly accessible on the URL:\n```\nhttps://<project-number>.lumidata.eu/<bucket_name>\n```\n\nOnly shortcuts to the project storage spaces in LUMI-O that have valid\nauthentication credentials will be visible in the file browser, so once the\nauthentication expires after 7 days, they will no longer be visible.\nIf you no longer need a configured connection to LUMI-O, you can either delete\nthe remote, which keeps the authentication credentials valid, or revoke the\nremote, which will revoke the authentication credentials.\n\n!!! note\n    Uploading from your local computer to LUMI-O directly is currently\n    recommended only for small files.\n\n### Active Jobs\n\nThe _Active Jobs_ app can be found under the _Jobs_ section in the top navbar.\nIn the app you will be able to see your currently running and recently completed Slurm jobs.\nBy expanding the row for the job using the arrow on the left side more details about the job will be visible.\n\n\n### Interactive applications\n\nFor instructions on how interactive applications work,\nsee the [generic instructions on interactive applications](./interactive-apps.md),\nor the applications specific instructions:\n\n- [Desktop](./desktop.md)\n- [Julia-Jupyter](./julia-jupyter.md)\n- [Jupyter](./jupyter.md)\n- [Jupyter for courses](./jupyter-for-courses.md)\n- [TensorBoard](./tensorboard.md)\n- [Visual Studio Code](./vscode.md)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer accessible via a web interface at www.lumi.csc.fi, offering various features including file management, shell access, and interactive applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULIA-JUPYTER<|>EVENT<|>An interactive Jupyter session with Julia programming language support available on LUMI's web interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER<|>EVENT<|>An interactive Jupyter session available on LUMI's web interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER FOR COURSES<|>EVENT<|>A specialized interactive Jupyter session for courses available on LUMI's web interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENSORBOARD<|>EVENT<|>TensorBoard interactive application available on LUMI's web interface for visualizing TensorFlow data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>EVENT<|>Visual Studio Code interactive application available on LUMI's web interface for code editing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-O<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud storage service accessible via LUMI's web interface, offering private and public remote storage options)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULIA-JUPYTER<|>LUMI<|>Julia-Jupyter is an interactive application available through LUMI's web interface<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER<|>LUMI<|>Jupyter is an interactive application available through LUMI's web interface<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER FOR COURSES<|>LUMI<|>Jupyter for Courses is an interactive application designed for educational purposes on LUMI's web interface<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TENSORBOARD<|>LUMI<|>TensorBoard is an interactive application available through LUMI's web interface for TensorFlow visualization<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VISUAL STUDIO CODE<|>LUMI<|>Visual Studio Code is an interactive application available through LUMI's web interface for code editing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-O<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-O is a cloud storage service that can be accessed and configured via LUMI's web interface<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
