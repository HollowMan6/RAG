It can be used in desktop, server, web\nand mobile environments.\n\nCSC organizes ArcGIS software consortium for Finnish universities and\nuniversities of applied sciences. The members of current consortium are\nlisted at the end of this page. \n\nTo the members of ArcGIS software consortium these products are available (for details see the license agreement Appendix A):\n\n-   ArcGIS Online\n-   ArcGIS Pro and Desktop.\n-   ArcGIS Enterprise \n-   ArcGIS Drone2map, NEW 2022\n-   Esri CityEngine\n-   ArcGIS Monitor\n-   ArcGIS Hub Premium\n-   ArcGIS Developer Subscription\n-   ArcGIS Premium Apps\n-   Virtual Campus courses\n-   [Finnish road and street dataset by Esri Finland](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/cscjemma/Accessible+for+ArcGIS+consortium+members). It is meant for\n    routing and geocoding. This dataset is based on Digiroad, but includes several corrections and\n    enhancements. \n\nMost of the software products are available for *unlimited* number of users. ArcGIS may be used for teaching, \nresearch or in limited amounts for administrative work. Use for commercial purposes is forbidden. \nSoftware may be installed to the computers of the consortium member university and computers of personnel \nand students and may be used at home or during field work according to the user terms. The more detailed terms of\nuse can be found from [ArcGIS site license agreement](../img/ArcGIS_education_Institution_terms_and_conditions_2020-2022.pdf).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## ArcGIS  Desktop and ArcGIS Pro\nAll old ArcGIS Desktop users are encouraged to [move to ArcGIS Pro](https://support.esri.com/en/arcmap-esri-plan), because active development of ArcGIS Desktop has stopped.\n\n### Installation\n-   [Installation guidelines for ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/install-and-sign-in-to-arcgis-pro.htm) and [ArcGIS Desktop](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/installation-guide/introduction.htm).\n-   For the installation you need **installation package**, ask your University's ArcGIS contact person. ArcGIS Pro installation package can also be [downloaded from ArcGIS Online](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/download-arcgis-pro.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_F19E35C5A28F44F69A0EA3F464A0E015). \n-   Please install also necessary [patches and service packs](https://support.esri.com/en/Products/Desktop/arcgis-desktop/arcmap/).\n\n### License\nArcGIS products need to be authorized. Licensing options for consortium members:\n\n-   **Named users**, main option for ArcGIS Pro, not available for ArcGIS desktop. The user must have home university's ArcGIS Online \naccount with personal ArcGIS Pro license. Ask this from your home university ArcGIS Online administrator.  \n-   **Concurrent licenses** from CSC license server, main option ArcGIS for Desktop, but also available for ArcGIS Pro. \nAsk your home university's ArcGIS contact person for address of the license server and the port numbers to be opened. \nHelp: [ArcGIS Pro](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-concurrent-use-license.htm) \nand [ArcGIS Desktop](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/installation-guide/authorization-wizard.htm).\n-   **Single use license**s, for ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS for Desktop, only for university personnel. Single Use license does not \nneed internet connection, so useful for example during field work. Single Use licenses are always valid until end of the calendar year. \nSingle Use licenses are available from University's contact persons.\n\n  \n!!! note\n    CSC license server is available only from FUNET (Finnish\n    Universities) network. When working outside the FUNET network, for\n    example at home, you should first connect to your\n    university network (VPN). \n\n#### Borrowing concurrent licenses\n\nArcGIS Educational site license includes also possibility to borrow\nlicenses for 100 days. With a borrowed license it is possible to work\nwithout Internet connection or outside of FUNET network.\n\nLicense is borrowed with [ArcGIS Administrator](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/administer/borrowing-and-returning-licenses.htm) or [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-concurrent-use-license.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_9E03C2B7A83C4FE4A41408EE7E0498CB):\n\n-   Always borrow the base product ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro, only Advanced level is available.\n-   All extensions need to be borrowed separately, you are free to\n    choose which ones you need. Especially with ArcGIS Pro make sure you borrow all the extensions you need. It is not possible to add extensions to already borrowed base product.\n-   Licenses borrowed at the end of year are always returned on 31th of December, because annual license renewal.\n- Returning borrowed license does not work with ArcGIS Pro. License is automatically returned at the last day of borrow.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## ArcGIS Server \n\nIt does not use license server and needs a registration code for\ninstallation, these are available from University's contact persons.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## ArcGIS Online\n\n[ArcGIS Online] is a platform\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
