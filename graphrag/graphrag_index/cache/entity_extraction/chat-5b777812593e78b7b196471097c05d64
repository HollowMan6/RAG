Note\n    While we try our hardest to make tools easy to use, parallel file systems with a\n    huge amount of files and data are complicated. Read the full instructions before\n    using the tool!\n\nKeeping track of how much data/files one has on the disk and (re)moving it in a\ntimely manner ensures a more performant file system for all users.\n\nWhen querying size information it's important to limit the processed set of files.\nSome operations can be both slow and heavy on the file system. In other words, don't\nrun the tool on the whole project folder (e.g `/scratch/project_12345`), but choose\ninstead smaller sub-folders where you think you might have a lot of files or data\nwhich could possibly be moved/compressed/removed. By default, the tool will only\nfetch size data for 30 mins before quitting.\n\n## Short prelude\n\nLUE is a tool available on CSC supercomputers which shows the amount of data and\nnumber of files within a given folder on the parallel file system.\n\nImportantly, LUE is significantly faster than standard tools like `stat` or `du`\n(these being slow to the point of infeasibility on a bad day), while being nicer\non the file system. This, however, comes with a possible slight loss in accuracy.\n\nA secondary point is that LUE presents the results in a fairly understandable way,\nsaving the user from having to script something themselves based on raw `du` output.\n\nThe sources of possible inaccuracy are:\n\n1. Old files which have not been accessed are missing size data.\n      - There is a specific date (2020-11-18) before which data is not available on\n        **Puhti**. Mahti does not have a such a limitation.\n      - Files created/accessed after this should be ok.\n      - It's not always possible to accurately determine affected files in a\n        sufficiently efficient manner.\n2. We can't get the actual layout of the files on the disk, so we might slightly\n   overestimate the actual disk usage.\n      - A file which is 95 MB large might only consume 68 MB of disk space if it\n        contains large parts of only zeros.\n3. Files which are currently in use might not be reported correctly.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nLoad the module with:\n\n```bash\nmodule load lue\n```\n\nand start by running\n\n```bash\nlue <target_dir>\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```text\nTotal size: 8994868686 Processed files: 90551 Permission denied: 16 Missing size: 48955, Other err: 1\npath, total size, in dir size, % of total, % of dir\n---------------------------------------------------\n/scratch/project_12345/dirA  8.4GB  356KB 100.0 100.0\n    results                       3.7GB  458MB 44.15 44.15 NOSIZE:2\n    installations                 1.4GB  48KB  16.2  16.2 \n    datasetA                      684MB  64KB  7.9   7.9\n    datasetB                      530MB  56KB  6.12  6.12  NOPERM:1 NOSIZE:17\n    testing                       512MB  8KB   5.92  5.92 \n    images                        395MB  764KB 4.56  4.56 \n    numpy-git                     292MB  12KB  3.37  3.37 \n    newAB                         263MB  412KB 3.04  3.04  NOPERM:9 NOSIZE:953\n    cuda_old                      249MB  4KB   2.87  2.87 \n    AI-simu                       176MB  52KB  2.03  2.03  NOSIZE:43491\n    mpi-test                      60MB   52KB  0.69  0.69 \nWARNING: Size information is missing for 48956 files\nRerun with --sync-size to update size information, estimated duration: 43 seconds\n```\n\nWhile the tool is running it will print how many files it has processed, the total\nsize of the files, how many directories could not be opened and how many files did\nnot have a reported size.\n\n!!! info\n    Using the `-c/--count` flag you can display the number of files instead of the\n    amount of data.\n\nOnce the tool is finished going through the files, it will print the size of `<target_dir>`\nand the size of any sub-folders. The columns from left to right are:\n\n- The directory/file name\n- The total size of the directory (including subdirectories) or the size of the file\n- The size of all files in a directory (excluding subdirectories)\n- How many percent the directory or file is of the total size of `<target_dir>`\n- How many percent the directory or file is of the total size of its parent directory\n- Counts of how many directories could not be opened (`NOPERM`) or how many files\n  were missing size information (`NOSIZE`)\n\n!!! info\n    **If we could not open a directory we have no estimate on how much data is\n    contained in that directory**. See [updating-size](#updating-size) for how to\n    fix the `NOSIZE` error. The `NOPERM` error requires the owner of the directories\n    to fix the access rights.\n\nBy default, files or empty folders are not shown in the output.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
