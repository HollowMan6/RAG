By removing hardwired values, we provide easy customization that will allow to use the template in more circumstances and for a longer period of time, for example by changing the template image. A user of the template just needs to worry about the `values.yaml` file and not how these values fit into the complexities of the Chart. Helm uses _Go templates_ to accomplish this.\n\nThe [built-in](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/) values can be very handy, but we will mention only two of sets of them:\n\n* `Release` variables offer the basic information of this chart deployment. Information like the `Namespace` we are deploying this template to, or the `Name` of the Chart.\n* `Capabilities` is a more advance feature that provides information about what API objects and that version the Kubernetes cluster supports. For example the version of Kubernetes, or if `Ingress` or `Route` are supported. These two pieces of information allow us to make more widely compatible templates, as different versions of Kubernetes will need slightly different options.\n\nWe can also define our own configuration variables. We will set up a default value and at the same time allow the `values.yaml` file to override it. Let's start with the Volume `yaml` file from previous steps:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: html\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n  storageClassName: glusterfs-storage\nstatus: {}\n```\n\nIn this template we would like to parametrize at least two of the values: the `storage` size and the `storage class`. One allows the user to use more or less disk space, and the second allows to change the driver used for the storage. The resulting file would be something like this:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: html\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: {{ .Values.storage.size | default \"500Mi\" }}\n  storageClassName: {{ .Values.storage.class | default \"glusterfs-storage\" }}\nstatus: {}\n```\n\nAnd then a `values.yaml` file like:\n\n```yaml\nstorage:\n  size: 1Gi\n  class: glusterfs-storage\n```\n\nAs you can see all variables in the `values.yaml` file can be found from `{{ .Values }}`. We have also set up a default of `500Mi` in the template itself using the `default` function, and configured a value of `1Gi` at `values.yaml`. In this example the storage of `1Gi` will be used, but if we removed the line `size: 1Gi`, the storage will be the default of `500Mi`.\n\nOther values that might be interesting to configure:\n\n* The `host` which the application will be available at.\n* The `image` to use.\n* The number of `replicas` for the application.\n\n### Conditionals\n\nIt is possible to have conditionals in the templates, based on capabilities of the cluster, or in a configuration option. For example to activate `tls` or not\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1\nkind: Route\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  host: {{ .Values.host }}\n  {{ if eq .Values.tls \"active\" }}\n  tls:\n    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect\n    termination: edge\n  {{ end }}\n  to:\n    kind: Service\n    weight: 100\n    name: nginx\nstatus:\n  ingress: []\n```\n\nWhich needs to have an option in `values.yaml` like:\n\n```yaml\ntls: active\n```\n\n## Final product\n\nThe final chart will be:\n\n```sh\n$ find\n.\n./Chart.yaml\n./templates\n./templates/deployment.yaml\n./templates/service.yaml\n./templates/pvc.yaml\n./templates/route.yaml\n./values.yaml\n./charts\n./.helmignore\n```\n\n* `Chart.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v2\nname: example\ndescription: A Helm chart for Kubernetes\ntype: application\n\nversion: 0.1.0\n\nappVersion: \"1.16.0\"\n```\n\n* `templates/deployment.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: nginx\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  strategy:\n    type: Rolling\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - image: docker.io/bitnami/nginx:latest\n        name: nginx\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 8080\n          protocol: TCP\n        - containerPort: 8443\n          protocol: TCP\n        resources: {}\n        volumeMounts:\n        - mountPath: /opt/bitnami/nginx/html/\n          name: html\n      volumes:\n      - name: html\n        persistentVolumeClaim:\n          claimName: html\n```\n\n* `templates/service.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: nginx\n  ports:\n  - nodePort: 0\n    port: 8080\n    protocol: TCP\n    targetPort: 8080\n```\n\n* `templates/pvc\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
