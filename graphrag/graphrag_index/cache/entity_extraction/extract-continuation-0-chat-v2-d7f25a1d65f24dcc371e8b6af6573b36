Data encrypted with this way can be \nopened with several secure keys. If you utilize sensitive data services of \nCSC it is handy to use both project's public key and CSC public key in encryption. \nThis way the data can be used both in users local environment and in the \nsensitive data services of CSC.\n\n\n## 3. Project key generation example\n\n### 3.1 Generating keys\n\nIn the example below, researcher _Tiina Tutkija_ wants to use Allas to receive and store human sequence \ndata that she will use in her new research project. The project is called _AniMINE_. It\nwill last several years, and it will include several researchers and data sources. \nTiina Tutkija already has a customer project with Allas access at CSC.   \n\nNow she creates and stores encryption keys for the project. Tiina has _[cryp4gh-gui](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui/blob/master/README.md)_ \nencryption program installed on her laptop. She uses the _Generate Keys_ option to \ncreate a new key pair that is protected with password (in this case `H8koGN3lzkke`).  \nThe key files generated are named based on the user account of the creator \n(secret key: `ttutkija_crypt4gh.key`, public key: `ttutkija_crypt4gh.pub`). \nAs the keys will be used by several members of the project, Tiina renames the key \nfiles accordingly: `animine_crypt4gh.key` and `animine_crypt4gh.pub`.\n\n### 3.2 Storing keys with SD Connect\n\nNext, Tiina Tutkija logs in to [SD Connect service](https://sd-connect.csc.fi). \nAfter connecting she checks that **Current project** setting refers to the CSC project \nthat AniMINE project will be using. After that she clicks the **Create bucket** button to \ncreate a new bucket called `animine_keys`. Then she uses the same button to create another \nbucket called `animine_pub`.\n\nNow SD Connect contains two new empty buckets. Tiina opens the bucket `amimine_keys` and uses **Upload** \nbutton to start upload process. In the upload page she checks that options **Encrypt files before upload** \nis **on** (which is the default setting). Then she uses **Select files for upload** to select both key files \nto be uploaded and starts the upload process by clicking button **Encrypt and upload** in the bottom of the page.\nAfter uploading, she needs to press the _reload button_ of the browser to update the state of the browser.\n\nWhen the upload is ready, Tiina switches back to the _Browser view_ of SD Connect and moves to the bucket `animine_pub`. \nShe clicks the _upload button_ again and this time turns **off** **Encrypt files before upload** and then uploads **ONLY** \nthe public key (`animine_crypt4gh.pub`) to this bucket.\n\nAfter uploading, she again needs to press the reload button of the browser to update the state of the browser.\n\nFinally, she opens a simple text editor to create short instructions file about the keys. \nThe content of the file, named as `animine_key_instructions.txt`, is as follows:\n\n```text\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAniMINE  encryption keys created on 16.3. 2022 by project manager Tiina Tutkija.\nFollowing key files are used to encrypt sensitive data used by AniMINE project.\nKeys are used with crypt4gh encryption tool.\nPublic key:   animine_crypt4gh.pub\nSecret key:   animine_crypt4gh.key\nThe password of the secret key is:  H8koGN3lzkke\nNote that the secret key and password should never be given or shown to \nusers that are not members of this project.\n\nYou can find a readable copy of the public key in SD Connect in location\n    animine_pub/animine_crypt4gh.pub\n\nYou can freely download and send this public key to persons and organizations \nthat provide data for AniMINE project. If you want to use data, that has \nbeen protected using this key pair, locally, please contact project manager \nTiina Tutkija to get your own copy of the secret key and instructions for \nlocal decryption. Please use this document, that is readable only in the \nSD Desktop environment of this project, as the only written reference \nfor the password. \n\nDelete the local copy of the secret key when it is no longer actively used. \n------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nShe uploads this text file to the `animine_keys` bucket with \nthe default encryption option on and then deletes the file from her local computer.\n\nNow the bucket `animine_keys` contain objects:\n\n   * `data/animine_crypt4gh.pub.c4gh`\n   * `data/animine_crypt4gh.key.c4gh`\n   * `data/animine_key_instructions.txt.c4gh`\n\nAnd bucket `animine_pub` contains object:\n\n   * `data/animine_crypt4gh.pub`\n\n\n## 4. Opening a storage bucket for importing data from data producer\n\nOnce you have access to Allas, you can create\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secure environment for storing sensitive data, utilizing SD Connect interface for encryption and access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Interface used for encrypting data with CSC public key, allowing project members to access encrypted keys and passwords)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service used by project members to check keys and passwords for their projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Encryption tool that allows encryption with several public keys, used within CSC's sensitive data services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIINA TUTKIJA<|>PERSON<|>Researcher creating and storing encryption keys for the AniMINE project, with access to Allas at CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANIMINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Research project led by Tiina Tutkija, focusing on human sequence data, lasting several years and involving multiple researchers and data sources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC's storage service accessed by Tiina Tutkija for the AniMINE project)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT<|>SD CONNECT<|>SD Connect is used to encrypt data for the CSC Sensitive Data Environment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD CONNECT<|>SD DESKTOP<|>SD Desktop allows project members to access data encrypted and managed through SD Connect<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SENSITIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT<|>CRYPT4GH<|>CSC Sensitive Data Environment uses Crypt4GH as its encryption tool<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIINA TUTKIJA<|>ANIMINE<|>Tiina Tutkija is the project manager of AniMINE, responsible for creating and managing encryption keys<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIINA TUTKIJA<|>ALLAS<|>Tiina Tutkija uses Allas for storing human sequence data for the AniMINE project<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANIMINE<|>ALLAS<|>The AniMINE project utilizes Allas for data storage<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
