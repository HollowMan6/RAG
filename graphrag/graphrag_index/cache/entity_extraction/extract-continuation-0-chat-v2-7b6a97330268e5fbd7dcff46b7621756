Read more on our separate [Conda deprecation page](../support/tutorials/conda.md).\n\n\n## Available\n\nRAPIDS is available on both Puhti and Mahti. Currently supported\nRAPIDS versions:\n\n- 22.04, based on [RAPIDS official Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/rapidsai/): `22.04`\n\nContains the [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) suite (including\n[cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf),\n[cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml),\n[cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph), and\n[XGBoost](https://rapids.ai/xgboost.html)) for Python with GPU support via CUDA.\n\nIf you find that some package is missing, you can often install it yourself with\n`pip install --user`. See\n[our Python documentation](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md) for\nmore information on how to install packages yourself. If you think that some\nimportant RAPIDS-related package should be included in the module provided by\nCSC, please [contact our servicedesk](../support/contact.md).\n\nAll modules are based on containers using Apptainer (previously known\nas Singularity). Wrapper scripts have been provided so that common\ncommands such as `python`, `python3`, `pip` and `pip3` should work as\nnormal. For other commands, you need to prefix them with\n`apptainer_wrapper exec`. For more information, see\n[CSC's general instructions on how to run Apptainer containers](../computing/containers/run-existing.md).\n\n## License\n\nRAPIDS is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this software, initialize it with:\n\n```bash\nmodule load rapids\n```\n\nto access the default version.\n\nTo see all the available versions, run:\n\n```bash\nmodule avail rapids\n```\n\nTo check the exact packages and versions included in the loaded module, you can run:\n\n```bash\nlist-packages\n```\n\n!!! warning \"Note\" \n\n    Login nodes are not intended for heavy computing, please use\n    Slurm batch jobs instead.
