The exact version is `v3.11`, it is the last released version in the `3.XX` series. The underlining Kubernetes version is v1.11. Rahti 1 is in open beta, and was not meant to reach production status.\n\nRahti 2 production is the next version of OpenShift OKD running in CSC. The underlining version of Kubernetes is v1.28. This version uses [cri-o](https://cri-o.io/) as the container runtime. `CRI-o` it is a lightweight alternative to using Docker as the runtime for kubernetes, both are fully compatible with each other and follow the `OCI` standard. Due to the fact that OpenShift OKD v4 is a re-implementation, there is no upgrade path provided by the manufacturer for Rahti 1 (OKD v3.11) to become Rahti 2 production (OKD 4.xx). So in other words, this means that every single application running in Rahti 1 needs to be migrated to production Rahti 2 manually. The two versions will run in parallel for a certain amount of time, but all wanted applications should be migrated to new platform by the latest June 2024.\n\n## General steps\n\nBefore you start the migration, you need to gather information about your application:\n\n1. Where is the **data stored**? And how is it **accessed**? Do you use a database?\n     1. If you use a PostgreSQL database hosted in Rahti, think about migrating to [Pukki DBaaS](../../dbaas/).\n     1. If you use Read-Write-Once (RWO) volumes, you can easily migrate them to Rahti 2. Just follow the instruction in the [How to use storage?](#how-to-use-storage) section.\n     1. If you use Read-Write-Many (RWX), you have to check why are you using it. It may be two main options: (1) It was the default and you could use a RWO volume instead because you are only mounting the volume once, or (2) You need to mount at the same time the same volume in several Pods. If you are in option (2), sadly there is not yet a supported solution in Rahti 2 for RWX, please contact us at <servicedesk@csc.fi> and let us know your use case, we are gathering customer needs to better develop the RWX solution. And we will work together on possible alternatives.\n\n     In order to see the storage type of your volumes, you can check the types in the Storage page.\n\n     ![Storage page](../img/storage-page.png)\n\n1. What are the **CPU** and **memory** requirements? Rahti 2 has lower _default_ **memory** or **CPU** limits, see the [What are the default limits?](#what-are-the-default-limits) section for more details about this.\n\n1. How was the application **deployed** in Rahti 1? Ideally you used [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/), [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) or Source to Image, and deploying your application to Rahti 2 will be simple. If not, consider creating one Helm chart using the guide [How to package a Kubernetes application with Helm](../../tutorials/helm/). As a last option, you may copy manually each API object.\n1. How do users access the application? What are the URLs? Is the URL is a Rahti provided URL (`*.rahtiapp.fi`), or a dedicated domain?\n    1. If you use a dedicated domain, you need to see with your DNS provider how to update the name record. The DNS information can be found on the [Route](../../rahti2/networking/#routes) documentation.\n    1. If you use a URL of the type `*.rahtiapp.fi`, you will no longer be able to use use it in Rahti 2 and will need to migrate to `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` or to a dedicated domain.\n1. Migration day considerations. What is an acceptable downtime? - We can provide you some assistance on planning the migration, but we cannot coordinate with your users or decide what is an acceptable downtime.\n\nSuggested migration procedure:\n\n1. Deploy a test application in Rahti 2.\n1. Make a copy of the data from Rahti 1 to Rahti 2. Remember to write down the time it takes.\n1. Validate that the application works as expected in Rahti 2. Stress tests are a recommended way to better catch any possible issue.\n1. Schedule the migration, where you stop the Rahti 1 app, copy the data, and make the necessary DNS updates.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How to log in Rahti 2?\n\nGo to [Rahti 2](https://rahti.csc.fi/), click in `Login`\n\n![Rahti 2 login](../img/rahti_login2.png)\n\nYou will be then served with a page with all the authentication options that Rahti 1 accepts. Choose the one that is more convenient for you, all your identities should be linked to the same Rahti 1 account.\n\n#### Command line login\n\nIn order to get the \"login command\", once you have logged in the web interface, click on your name and then in \"Copy Login Command\". For security reasons, you will be required to login again, after that you will be served the page the login command you can copy\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
