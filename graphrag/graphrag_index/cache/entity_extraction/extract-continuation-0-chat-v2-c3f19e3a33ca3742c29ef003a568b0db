This can be used when the virtual machine fails to boot due to a kernel panic, full disk, or when you simply lost access to the private key. By allowing you to boot from a different image, you will be able to mount and edit the files on your current disk and fix the problem.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n### Kernel Panic\n\nCheck your instance Console Log (web UI: **Instances** > `<your instance>` > **Log**)\n\n```sh\n[    1.041853] Loading compiled-in X.509 certificates\n[    1.043433] Loaded X.509 cert 'CentOS Linux kpatch signing key:ea0413152cde1d98ebdca3fe6f0230904c9ef717'\n[    1.046556] Loaded X.509 cert 'CentOS Linux Driver update signing key:7f421ee0ab69461574bb358861dbe77762a4201b'\n[    1.050310] Loaded X.509 cert 'CentOS Linux kernel signing key:d4115f110055db56c8d605ab752173cfb1ac54d8'\n[    1.053448] registered taskstats version 1\n[    1.055861] Key type trusted registered\n[    1.057771] Key type encrypted registered\n[    1.059249] IMA: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass!

The fix is to use (some) previous, working kernel. Since you can't boot the server, you have to make the fix to the Volume (boot files) by using another instance.\n\n### Access denied\n\nThe problem can be as simple as:\n\n```sh\n$ ssh cloud-user@<floating-ip>\ncloud-user@<floating-ip>: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).\n```\n\n## How to fix the issue, nova rescue\n\nNote that there are always several ways to fix any problem, this FAQ is mainly meant to show one of the ways to fix these kinds of problems.
