Below we illustrate the main available options. \n\n!!! Note\n    These options are available only on virtual desktops created after February 2, 2023. Please [contact service desk](../../support/contact.md) if you are working with older desktops. \n\n\n## Detaching and reattaching a volume \n\nWith the option _Detach volume_, you can easily disconnect a volume from your virtual desktop. The volume and its content will be stored in the same CSC project where it was initially created. You can compare this operation to disconnecting or attaching a hard drive to your laptop.\n\nTo detach a volume from your virtual desktop:\n\n1. Save and close all the files on the volume to prevent data corruption and log out from the virtual desktop.\n\n2. From SD Desktop homepage, click on _SD Desktop management page_.\n\n3. Here, under _Available desktops_ choose the correct virtual desktop, and in the same raw, on the right side, click on _Detach volume_.\nA message will ask to confirm the operation.\n\n\nWhen you want to access the data saved in the detached volume, you can reattach it to a new desktop:\n\n1. From the SD Desktop homepage, click on _SD Desktop management page_.\n\n2. Under _Desktop selection_ choose the necessary options (CSC project, operating system etc.). \n\n3. Under _Add External Volume (optional)_ click inside _Choose from existing volumes_. The user interface will visualize available volumes stored in the same CSC project. Note: do not click on the options _volume size_ or _volume name_. \n\n4. Click on _Create desktop_\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n- A detached volume can not be reattached to an existing virtual desktop, only to new virtual desktops during creation phase. \n\n- The content of a detached volume can not be accessed or deleted.\n\n- To delete or access the volume content, attach it to a desktop with the same operating system during the desktop creation phase. \n\n- Volumes can not be moved or transferred between CSC projects for security reasons.\n\n[![Desktop-volume](images/desktop/volume.png)](images/desktop/volume.png)\n\n## Pausing or unpausing a virtual desktop\n\nYou can pause a virtual desktop. In this manner, the desktop will stop consuming billing units. \n\nTo pause the desktop:\n\n1. Close all the programs, save/close all the files, and log out from the virtual desktop to prevent data corruption.\n\n2. On the SD Desktop homepage, click on _Go To SD Desktop Management_;\n\n3. Here, under _Available desktops_ select the correct virtual desktop, and in the same raw, on the right side, click on _Pause desktop_. Note: you can not detach a volume or access a paused desktop. \n\n4. A message will ask to confirm the operation, which can take up to 30 minutes.\n\nYou can unpause the virtual desktop at any time from the same page. Also, in this case, the restart processes can take up to 30 minutes:\n\n1. On the SD Desktop homepage, click on _Go To SD Desktop Management_;\n\n2. Here, under _Available desktops_ select the correct virtual desktop, and in the same raw, on the right side, click on _Resume_. \n\n!!! Note\n    Restarting a paused desktop is only possible for active CSC projects with available billing units. \n\n[![Desktop-volume](images/desktop/pause.png)](images/desktop/pause.png)\n\n\n## Rebooting a desktop\n\nIf your virtual desktop or software becomes unresponsive, you can reboot (restart) it. After the reboot, all files and software saved on the virtual desktop will remain accessible.\n\n!!! Note\n    If the Data Gateway application becomes unresponsive due to old sessions running in the background, there's no need to restart your desktop. Instead, you can utilize the terminal to identify and halt the process. For assistance, please [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md), subject \"Sensitive data.\"\n\nTo reboot a desktop:\n\n1. Close all programs and ensure you save/close any files to prevent data corruption.\n    \n2. Go to the SD Desktop homepage and select \"Go To SD Desktop Management.\"\n    \n3. Scroll to the end of the page. Here, under \"Available desktops,\" choose the relevant virtual desktop. On the right side of the same row, click \"Options\" and then select \"Reboot.\"\n    \n4. Confirm the operation when prompted. The process may take up to 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n## Deleting a desktop\n\nAt the end of your analysis, you can delete your virtual desktop, including the external volume and all files saved in it. You cannot undo this action:\n\n1. On SD Desktop Homepage, click on _Go to SD Desktop Management page_.\n\n2. Under _Available desktops_ select the correct virtual desktop.\n\n3. On the same raw, on the right side, click on _Options_ and on _Delete_.\n\n!!! Note\n    Please contact all the project members before deleting a virtual desktop. With this action, you will delete the entire workspace, including all files saved in the virtual desktop or external volume by other project members. \n\n\n\n [![Desktop-delete](images/desktop/desktop-deleting.png)](images/desktop/desktop-deleting.png)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service that allows management of virtual desktops including volume management, pausing, rebooting, and deleting functionalities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project within which volumes are created, stored, and managed in the context of using SD Desktop Service)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP SERVICE<|>CSC PROJECT<|>Volumes managed by SD Desktop Service are stored within CSC Projects<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
