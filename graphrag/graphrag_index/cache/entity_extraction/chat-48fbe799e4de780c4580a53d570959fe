Data can be downloaded for example with [FORCE](../../../apps/force.md).\n    \n[**Terramonitor**](https://www.terramonitor.com) provides pre-prosessed analysis ready Sentinel-2 data, also from Finland. It is a commercial service.\n\nAlmost all of the services provide download with web interface and bulk download via API. Most services require free self-registration. \n\n!!! default \"Other geospatial datasets\"\n\n    To find other geospatial datasets, check out [CSC open spatial dataset list](https://research.csc.fi/open-gis-data).  \n\n### ESA Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem\n\n[Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) (CDSE) provides the possibility to browse, visualize, download and analyze EO data. It started in late 2023 and replaced ESA's SciHub. CDSE mainly includes different Sentinel datasets, but also some complimentary datasets, inc Landsat, see [full list of CDSE datasets](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data.html). Note that duplicates may be available due to reprocessing with newest baselines.  \n\nCDSE data APIs and data download:\n\n* [CDSE Browser](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/browser/) - web interface for accessing, exploring and downloading the data. \n- [CDSE Catalog APIs](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/apis/catalogue-apis) support 3 different options for finding suitable data: OData, OpenSearch and STAC. OData and OpenSearch provide similar functionality. In principle, also STAC has a lot of potential, because it would easier to download only needed data, for example only some bands or geographically only parts of data. It is the newest of data APIs and at the moment does not support any other search criteria than collection, time and location, so for example cloud cover filtering is not possible (yet). So use cases for Sentinel2 STAC are currently limited, but for Sentinel1 it might be more suitable.\n- [CDSE S3](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/S3.html) for high-performance parallel access and download from CDSE object storage.\n\nSeveral example scripts are available for CDSE data download: \n\n* [OpenSearch API + rclone by CSC](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/Copernicus_data_download), option to save to CSC Allas or some other object storage .\n* [OData API + Python requests](https://github.com/eu-cdse/notebook-samples/blob/main/geo/odata_basics.ipynb)\n* Alternatively [s3cmd and Python boto3](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/S3.html) can be used for S3 downloads.\n\nYou can also read data directly from S3 with GDAL or GDAL-based tools, see [CSC GDAL cloud tutorial](gdal_cloud.md). \n\nThese data APIs are free of charge. Different services have different limitations, see [CDSE Quotas and limitations](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Quotas.html). Compared to the ESA's previous SciHub service, the number of concurrent downloads per user has increased from two to four for most APIs.\n\nCDSE includes also [OpenEO](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/Collections.html) and [SentinelHub](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Data.html) services, which provide more analysis ready datasets and own download services and APIs. Both have own STAC. SentinelHub provides also OGC APIs. \n\n\n## How can I process EO data at CSC?\n\nYou can find information about geocomputing using CSC resources and how to get started on [CSC geocomputing pages](https://research.csc.fi/geocomputing), including links to creating user accounts and all other practical information. \n\n### What to consider when choosing a software?\n\nThere is no single software perfect for every task and taste. The right software depends as much on the task to be worked on, as on the taste and skillset of the user. The following list sunmmarizes things that need to be considered when choosing a software. \n\n* Functionality: Does the software provide the tools you need to reach your goal?\n* Interaction type: How do you want to interact with the software?\n    * Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n    * Command Line Interface (CLI)\n    * Scripting \n* Technical aspects:\n    * Reproducibility: Does the tool provide the possibility to record work steps?\n    * Supported operating systems: Can the tool be installed to the operating system available to you?\n    * Automation possibility: Can the tool execution be automatized for big data processing, if needed?\n    * Combination possibility: Can you combine the tool with other tools?\n    * Computational efficiency: Does the tool make good use of the available computational resources (especially GPUs)?\n    * Support for parallel computing or batch processing\n* Open source vs proprietary\n    * Proprietary tools need licenses which may be expensive and/or limiting the use of the tool\n    * FOSS (free and open source software) allows the user to inspect the source code and provide high level insights in its functionality\n\n### What applications are available on Puhti?\n\n[**FORCE**](../../../apps/force.md) - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring. All-in-one processing engine with CLI for EO image archives.
