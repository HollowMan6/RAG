Some frameworks are tightly coupled to a specific framework,\nsuch as PyTorch `DistributedDataParallel`, DeepSpeed or TensorFlow's\n`tf.distribute.Strategy`, while others are more general, for example\nHorovod.\n\nIndependent of which framework you pick, pay attention to the approach\nused to launch jobs. For example with Horovod it is common to use MPI,\nwhile DeepSpeed can be configured to use MPI or its own parallel\nlauncher. In some frameworks, the launching mechanism may also vary\ndepending on if you are running a single- or multi-node job.\n\nAll frameworks should use\n[NCCL](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/overview.html)\n(NVIDIA) or [RCCL](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl) (AMD)\nfor fast inter-GPU communication, even if MPI is used to set up the\nconnections.\n\n\n### PyTorch DDP\n\n[PyTorch\ndistributed](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html),\nand in particular `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP), offers a nice way\nof running multi-GPU and multi-node PyTorch jobs. Unfortunately, the\nPyTorch documentation has been a bit lacking in this area, and\nexamples found online can often be out-of-date. Hence, to make usage\nof DDP on CSC's supercomputers easier, we have created a [set of\nexamples on how to run simple DDP jobs in the\ncluster](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples). In the\nexamples we use the\n[rendezvous](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/rendezvous.html)\nmechanism to set up communcations across nodes, not MPI.\n\nExample Slurm batch job for running PyTorch DDP on a single full node:\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpu\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40\n    #SBATCH --mem=320G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:4\n    \n    module purge\n    module load pytorch\n    \n    srun python3 -m torch.distributed.run --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 \\\n        myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpumedium\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=128\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:4\n    \n    module purge\n    module load pytorch\n\n    srun python3 -m torch.distributed.run --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 \\\n        myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"LUMI\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=small-g\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=56\n    #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8\n    #SBATCH --mem=480G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    \n    module purge\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n    module load pytorch\n    \n    srun python3 -m torch.distributed.run --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 \\\n        myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n\n\nExample of running PyTorch DDP on 2 full nodes:\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpu\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40\n    #SBATCH --mem=320G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:4\n    \n    export RDZV_HOST=$(hostname)\n    export RDZV_PORT=29400\n    \n    module purge\n    module load pytorch\n\n    srun python3 -m torch.distributed.run \\\n        --nnodes=$SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES \\\n        --nproc_per_node=4 \\\n        --rdzv_id=$SLURM_JOB_ID \\\n        --rdzv_backend=c10d \\\n        --rdzv_endpoint=\"$RDZV_HOST:$RDZV_PORT\" \\\n        myprog.py <options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpumedium\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=128\n    #SBATCH --\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
