Thus, different versions of a dataset can be stored so that in the case of a new dataset version, only the changes compared to the previous version needs to be stored. This approach also enables retrieving not just the latest version, also earlier versions of the backuped data. \n\nIn addition to hashing, `restic` encrypts the data using AES256 cipher. The Allas specific backup tool, `allas-backup` (available in Puhti and Mahti) is based on `restic` but it uses a fixed pre-defined encryption password and thus it should not be used, if high security level is required. In those cases you can use `restic` directly.\n\nTo use Allas as the storage place for `restic`, first open a connection to Allas. When you start using `restic` for the first time, you must set up a `restic` repository.\nThe repository definition includes a protocol (`swift` in this case), location that is the bucket name in the case of Allas, and a prefix for the stored data objects. For example: \n<pre><b>restic init --repo swift:123_restic:/backup</b>\nenter password for new repository: <b>************</b>\nenter password again: <b>************</b>\n\ncreated restic repository a70df2ced1 at swift:123_restic:/backup\n\nPlease note that knowledge of your password is required to access\nthe repository. Losing your password means that your data is\nirrecoverably lost.\n</pre>\n\nThe initialization process asks for an encryption password for the repository. \n\nNow, you can backup a file or directory to the Restic repository in Allas. In the example below a directory _my_data_ is backuped.\n\n<pre> <b>restic backup --repo swift:123_restic:/backup my_data/</b>\nenter password for repository: <b>************</b>\nrepository a70df2ce opened successfully, password is correct\ncreated new cache in /users/kkayttaj/.cache/restic\n\nFiles:         258 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified\nDirs:            0 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified\nAdded to the repo: 2.018 MiB\n\nprocessed 258 files, 2.027 MiB in 0:00\nsnapshot a706c054 saved\n</pre>\n\nAfter modifying one file in _my_data_ directory we do a second backup:\n<pre><b>restic backup --repo swift:123_restic:/backup my_data/</b>\nenter password for repository: <b>************</b>\nrepository a70df2ce opened successfully, password is correct\n\nFiles:           0 new,     1 changed,   257 unmodified\nDirs:            0 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified\nAdded to the repo: 1.154 KiB\n\nprocessed 258 files, 2.027 MiB in 0:00\nsnapshot e3b46fe2 saved\n</pre>\n\nWith command `restic sanpshots` we can see that we have two versions of my_data in the backup repository:\n\n<pre><b>restic snapshots --repo swift:123_restic:/backup</b> \nenter password for repository: <b>************</b>\nrepository a70df2ce opened successfully, password is correct\nID        Time                 Host          Tags        Paths\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na706c054  2021-02-12 14:43:03  r07c52.bullx              /run/nvme/job_4891841/data/my_data\ne3b46fe2  2021-02-12 14:47:18  r07c52.bullx              /run/nvme/job_4891841/data/my_data\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2 snapshots\n</pre>\n\nIf we would like to get back the first version, we could download it with snapshot id and command `restic restore`.\n\n<pre><b>restic restore --repo swift:123_restic:/backup a706c054 --target ./ </b>\nenter password for repository: <b>************</b>\nrepository a70df2ce opened successfully, password is correct\nfound 3 old cache directories in /users/kkmattil/.cache/restic, run `restic cache --cleanup` to remove them\nrestoring <Snapshot a706c054 of [/run/nvme/job_4891841/data/my_data] at 2021-02-12 14:43:03.215110283 +0200 EET by kkayttaj@r07c52.bullx> to ./\n</pre>\n\nThe actual data is stored as encrypted hash objects that are usable for other Allas tools.
