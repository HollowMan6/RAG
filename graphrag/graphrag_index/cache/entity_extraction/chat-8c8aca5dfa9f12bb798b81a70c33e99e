You don't need to have the\n`--account=` option set in your **local** `schrodinger.hosts` file. In your local file,\nit's enough that the different HOST entries exist (and the GPU-ones have GPUs specified).\n\nNote that the HOST entries and Slurm partitions (or queues) are two\ndifferent things. The HOST entries define resources using Slurm partitions.\n\n## How to speed up simulations?\n\nAll other Maestro modules run serial jobs, except Jaguar and Quantum Espresso, which can run\n\"real\" parallel jobs. Don't choose a \"parallel\" HOST for any other job type. Instead of\nMPI-parallel jobs, Maestro modules typically split the workload into multiple parts, each\nof which can be run independent of the others.\n[The Maestro documentation has an excellent section on this topic](https://www.schrodinger.com/documentation).\nIn the documentation, go to \"Getting started\" > \"Running Schrödinger Jobs\" >\n\"Running Distributed Schrödinger Jobs\".\n\nIt is typical to process a lot of molecules as part of a particular workload.\nIf you have enough molecules, you can split the full set into smaller subsets\nand process each of the subsets as a separate job. The Maestro modules have\neasy-to-use options for defining the number of subjobs. However, you must know\nin advance how many subjobs to launch. In principle, this requires knowing\nhow long one molecule takes, or testing for each different use case.\n\n!!! warning \"Important note\"\n    When you start working with a new system/dataset, don't test if you got the\n    syntax right with 1 000 000 molecules and 1000 subjobs. Instead, start out with e.g.\n    50 molecules and 2 subjobs. Learn how long it takes per molecule, confirm that your\n    submit syntax is correct, adjust your parameters if needed and only then scale up.\n\nIf you're using the GUI to set up your job script, specify how many (sub)jobs\n(processors) you want to use. You can easily edit this later in the submit\nscript if you change your mind.\n\nThe \"default\" submit script will work \"as is\" for small jobs. Just make\nsure you don't ask for too many (sub)jobs. As a rule of thumb, each subjob\nshould last at least 1 hour, and for very large jobs preferably 24 hours.\nRunning a lot of very short jobs is inefficient in many ways and may degrade\nthe performance of the system for all users, see our [high-throughput computing\nguidelines](../../computing/running/throughput.md). For large workflows, you'll\nneed to edit your scripts, see below.\n\n### Quantum ESPRESSO\n\nRunning multi-node jobs using the \"parallel\" HOST works well with Quantum ESPRESSO when appropriate\nparallelization flags are carefully specified. The default parallelization is over plane waves if\nno other options are specified. To improve on this, k-points (if more than one) can be partitioned\ninto \"pools\" using the `-npools` flag. Also, when running on several hundred cores, the scalability\ncan be further extended by dividing each pool into \"task groups\" which distributes the workload\nassociated with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) on the Kohn-Sham states. This is done using the\n`-ntg` flag. In order to have good load balancing among MPI processes, the number of k-point pools\nshould be an integer divisor of the number of k-points and the number of processors for FFT\nparallelization should be an integer divisor of the third dimension of the smooth FFT grid (this\ncan be checked from the output file, `grep \"Smooth grid\" *.out`). Further parallelization levels are\npresented in the [QE documentation](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/user_guide/node20.html).\n\nThe QE parallelization options can be specified in the Job Settings dialog of the QE calculations\npanel of the Maestro GUI. Running a job using 160 cores on Puhti (4 nodes) could be parallelized\nfor example with `-npools 4 -ntg 4` so that each k-point pool is given 40 cores, which are further\ndivided into 4 task groups of 10 cores each.\n\n!!! info \"Using full nodes\"\n    When running Maestro modules such as Quantum ESPRESSO on multiple nodes, remember to explicitly\n    request the appropriate number of nodes by editing the `schrodinger.hosts` file with the\n    `--nodes=<number of nodes>` flag. Requesting full nodes prevents fragmenting of the job and\n    decreases the amount of unnecessary communication between surplus nodes. For large subjobs you\n    may also need to tune the time and memory requested in the `schrodinger.hosts` file to suit your\n    needs.\n\n!!! info \"Host selection\"\n    A single core job as required by the driver process cannot be run on the `large` partition on\n    Puhti. To run multi-node subjobs you need to modify the submission script generated by the GUI\n    by specifying a separate driver HOST (e.g. `-DRIVERHOST interactive -SUBHOST parallel`, see also\n    [below](#advanced-host-selection)).\n\nThe following figures show the time to solution and scaling of the [PSIWAT\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
