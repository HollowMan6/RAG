For older versions\nsee the help message printed out by `module load` command.\n\nLoading the AlphaFold module will print out commands you can use to check the available\ncommand line options, e.g:\n\n```bash\npython3 $ALPHAFOLD_DIR/run_singularity.py --helpshort\n```\n\nThere are example batch job scripts available:\n\n```text\n$ALPHAFOLD_DIR/alphafold_cpu.slurm\n$ALPHAFOLD_DIR/alphafold_gpu.slurm\n```\n\n\n### Which version to use\n\nAlphaFold analysis consists of three stages:\n  - Multiple sequence alignment (CPU only)\n  - Structure prediction (GPU enabled)\n  - Optional: Chain relaxation (GPU enabled)\n\nBuilding the multiple sequen alignments takes a considerable amount of time, and in \ncase of short and simple sequences using GPU will only speed up the overall time a \nlitle. In these cases you will probably get better throughput using the CPU version, \nas there are more CPU resources available.\n\nIn case of longer and more complex strutures GPU will speed up the process\nconsiderably. \n\nIt may be difficult to know beforehand, so do some testing. If the run is taking \nmore than 3-4 hours on CPU, you should try using GPU.\n\n\n### Database\n\nAlphaFold needs a set of sequence databases to run. The total size of of these\ndatabases is almost 3 TiB.\n\nCSC maintains a copy of these databases compatible with the latest version of \nAlphaFold. Databases are mounted on all compute nodes in path `/mnt/datasets/alphafold`.\nThe path to databases is set with variable `$ALPHAFOLD_DATADIR`. See example batch\njob scripts for usage.\n\n```bash\nexport ALPHAFOLD_DATADIR=/mnt/datasets/alphafold\n```\n\nDue to the size of these databases CSC is only able to maintain one copy. If\nyou need a different version, you will need to download your own copy.\n\nYou can follow the [download instructions](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold#genetic-databases) on the AlphaFold home page.\n\n```bash\napptainer exec --bind /scratch $SING_IMAGE /scripts/download_all_data.sh <DOWNLOAD_DIR>\n```\n\nAlphaFold is very disk I/O heavy, so for use the databases should be copied to \n$LOCAL_SCRATCH. Even if copying takes some time (depends on file system load on\nPuhti, but typically ~1 h) the net gain on run time is considerable.\n\nWhen copying databases from /scratch to $LOCAL_SCRATCH, you should avoid overloading \nthe file system on /scratch, so aggressive multi-threaded copying approaches should \nbe avoided.\n\nUse for example:\n\n```bash\ncd $LOCAL_SCRATCH\ncp -r /scratch/project_12345/alphafold_db .\nexport ALPHAFOLD_DATADIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH/alphafold_db\n```\n\n## More Information\n\n*   [AlphaFold Homepage](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/)\n*   CSC installation is based on [Alphafold_singularity](https://github.com/prehensilecode/alphafold_singularity)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
