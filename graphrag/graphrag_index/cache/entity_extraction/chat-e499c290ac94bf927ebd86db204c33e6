If the\nnew checksum equals to the previously computed one, we can be pretty\nsure that the data is fully conserved.\n\nOne of the most common checksum algorithms is *md5* that is often used\nto verify the correctness of data files. For example, many scientific\ndata sets available on the internet are accompanied by a\nlist of md5 sums. The md5 sum is always a text string 32 characters\nlong. This string has the characteristics of a good checksum: it does\nnot tell anything about the actual content of the source file and any\nmodification to the original file produces a completely different\nchecksum. Other frequently used checksum algorithms include **SHA**\n(*Secure Hash Algorithm*) that is often used in cryptography and **CRC**\n(*Cyclic Redundancy Check*) that is common in data transfer.\n\nThe example below shows how to use **md5sum** in the CSC\nenvironment. An md5 checksum for a file is calculated with the command:\n\n```bash\nmd5sum file_name\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ md5sum poster1.pdf\ncc494699398122a6b6d93a5a69bd2667 poster1.pdf\n```\n\nYou can easily store the checksum in a file by redirecting the output of\nthe command to a new file with `>` character.\n\n```bash\nmd5sum poster1.pdf > poster1.pdf.md5\n```\n\nThe command above stores the checksum and file name to a new file called\n`poster1.pdf.md5`.\n\nChecking a set of files against an md5 sum list is done by using option\n`-c`.\n\n```bash\nmd5sum -c checksum_list\n```\n\nFor example, to check the validity of file `poster1.pdf` with the previously\ncreated checksum file `poster1.pdf.md5`, use command:\n\n```bash\n$ md5sum -c poster1.pdf.md5\nposter1.pdf: OK\n```\n\n## Encrypting files with GPG\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    If you work with sensitive data at CSC, please see our\n    [sensitive data services guide](../../../data/sensitive-data/index.md).\n\nFile encryption can be used to increase the security of your data. In normal\nconditions (i.e., when not working with sensitive data), encrypting files that\nlocate at CSC is not needed. The files can by\ndefault be accessed only by the user themselves. However, in principle, the\nsystem administrators of CSC are able to read all data at the servers of\nCSC. In some occasions the administrators may need to check file names\nand sizes, but the administrator policy of CSC strictly prohibits\naccessing the contents of user's data files. However, encryption may\nbe reasonable if you for example need to copy the data outside CSC or if\nencryption is required by the owner of the data.\n\nAt CSC, you can use the **GPG** program to encrypt your files. GPG\nis frequently used for creating *encryption key pairs* to protect emails\nand other data transfer. However, in this chapter we demonstrate only\nhow GPG can use used to encrypt individual files.\n\nThe basic syntax for encrypting a file with `gpg` command is:\n\n```bash\ngpg -c file_name\n```\n\nThe command asks the user to define a password for the file. This\npassword is not, and should not be, in any sense related to your CSC\npassword. After confirming the password, the command makes an encrypted\ncopy of the given file. By default, the encryption is done with CAST5\nalgorithm, but several other algorithms can be used too.\n\nTo open a GPG-encrypted file, give command:\n\n```bash\ngpg gpg_encrypted_file \n```\n\n### GPG example\n\nSay we have file a `my_file.txt` that we want to encrypt. This can be\ndone with command:\n\n```bash\ngpg -c my_file.txt\n```\n\nWhen the command is launched, the following prompt appears:\n\n```text\nEnter passphrase:\n```\n\nNow you can type in any password for the file. In this case we use\nfollowing password: `y8kIeg%a`. Once the password is typed, the programs\nasks you to confirm the password:\n\n```text\nRepeat passphrase:\n```\n\nWhen the encryption is finished we have two files: the original\nfile and and its encrypted version that has an extension `.gpg`.\n\n```bash\n$ ls  -l\n-rw-------+ 1 kkayttaj csc 1291176 Feb 11 15:57 my_file.txt\n-rw-------+ 1 kkayttaj csc  313848 Feb 11 16:05 my_file.txt.gpg\n```\n\nNote that in this case the encrypted file is smaller than the original\none. Now we can remove the original file.\n\n```bash\nrm my_file.txt\n```\n\nLater on, for example after copying the file to some other location, you\ncan extract the data with command:\n\n```bash\ngpg my_file.txt.gpg\n```\n\nThe program now asks for the password you used in encryption (in this\ncase: `y8kIeg%a`). After this, you again have two files: the encrypted file\n`my_file.txt.gpg` and the original, readable file `my_file.txt`. Note\nthat if you forget the password of your encrypted file, there is no one\nwho can open the file!\n\n## Managing access permissions of files and directories\n\nHundreds of users use the computing and storage environments of CSC. To\nkeep the files private and in order, each file and folder in the Linux\nenvironment of CSC is owned by a certain user account. In Linux systems\neach file has three user categories\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
