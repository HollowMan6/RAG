They are claimed by a pod using a **PersistentVolumeClaim**. When a\nnew claim is made, this can mean that either an existing volume is claimed or a\nnew one is created dynamically and given to the pod to use.\n\nThere are two storage classes available in Rahti 1:\n\n * *glusterfs-storage*. This kind of volume is a \"Read Write Many\" (RWX) type storage, this means multiple nodes can mount it in read and write mode. This is the default class. It is the most flexible class, as allows any pod anywhere in the cluster to read and write files. The downside is a lower performance than the next class.\n * *standard-rwo*. This kind is a \"Read Write Once\" (RWO), meaning that only one node can mount the volume (in read-write mode). It is faster than glusterfs, but it is limited to a single node.\n\n![PersistentVolumeClaim](../../img/pods-and-storage-pvc.drawio.svg)\n\nPersistent storage is requested in the cluster using `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects:\n\n*`pvc.yaml`*\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: testing-pvc\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteMany\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n```\n\nAbove will request a 1 GiB persistent storage that can be mounted in read-write\nmode by multiple nodes. Other access modes are ReadWriteOnce (Only one pod can mount it read-write) and ReadOnlyMany (Multiple pods can mount read-only).\n\nPersistent storage can be requested also via the web console.\n\n!!! warning\n    When a volume contains a high amount of files (>15 000), the time it takes to mount and be available can be higher than 5 minutes. The more files, the more time it takes to be available.\n\nThe persistent volume can be used in a pod by specifying `spec.volumes`\n(defines the volumes to attach) and `spec.containers.volumeMounts` (defines where\nto mount the attached volumes in the container's filesystem):\n\n*`pvc-pod.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mypod-vol\n  labels:\n    app: serveapp-vol\n    pool: servepod-vol\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: serve-cont\n    image: \"docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd\"\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: /mountdata\n      name: smalldisk-vol\n  volumes:\n  - name: smalldisk-vol\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: testing-pvc\n```\n\n!!! warning\n    When a Persistent Volume is deleted, the corresponding data is deleted **permanently**. It is highly recommended to make regular and versioned copies of the data to an independent storage system like [Allas](/data/Allas/using_allas/a_backup/).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Storage that persists during and after a pod's lifetime in Rahti 1, stored in resilient storages like CEPH, NFS, or GlusterFS and claimed by pods using PersistentVolumeClaim)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEPH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of resilient storage technology used for storing persistent volumes in Rahti 1)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of resilient storage technology used for storing persistent volumes in Rahti 1)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLUSTERFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of resilient storage technology used for storing persistent volumes in Rahti 1, supports Read Write Many access mode)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERSISTENTVOLUMECLAIM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A claim by a pod to use a persistent volume in Rahti 1, can lead to claiming an existing volume or dynamically creating a new one)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLUSTERFS-STORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage class in Rahti 1 offering Read Write Many type storage, allowing multiple nodes to mount it in read and write mode)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD-RWO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage class in Rahti 1 offering Read Write Once type storage, allowing only one node to mount the volume in read-write mode)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An independent storage system recommended for making regular and versioned copies of data)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>CEPH<|>Persistent volumes in Rahti 1 can be stored using CEPH technology<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>NFS<|>Persistent volumes in Rahti 1 can be stored using NFS technology<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>GLUSTERFS<|>Persistent volumes in Rahti 1 can be stored using GlusterFS technology<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>PERSISTENTVOLUMECLAIM<|>Persistent volumes are claimed by pods through PersistentVolumeClaim in Rahti 1<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLUSTERFS-STORAGE<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>GlusterFS-Storage is a class of persistent volumes in Rahti 1<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD-RWO<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>Standard-RWO is a class of persistent volumes in Rahti 1<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>PERSISTENT VOLUMES<|>Allas is recommended for backing up data from Persistent Volumes<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
