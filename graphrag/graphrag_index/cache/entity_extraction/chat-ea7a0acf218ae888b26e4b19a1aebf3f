Compared to real programming languages, like Python, Perl or c,\nprogramming with Linux (bash, tcsh, csh or sh) is computationally rather\nineffective. However, often handy Linux scripts can be constructed in a\nfew minutes. You do not have to know too much about command scripting to\nbe able to write simple programs that save a lot of time.\n\n## Constructing a script file\n\nA script file is a simple text file that can be constructed with normal\ntext editors like *nano*, *Emacs* or *vi*. To create a new script file,\ntype for example:\n\n```bash\nnano my_test.script\n```\n\nA script file usually starts with a line which defines the\ncommand shell to be used. In this guide, we use *bash* shell, which is the\ndefault command shell at CSC. The bash defining row is:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n```\n\nAfter that you add the Linux commands you wish to perform. In practice,\njust type in the file the commands that you would normally use to do\nthe task in an interactive command shell. For example, the following script can\nbe used to create a subdirectory `mapfiles` and copy all `.map` files there:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nmkdir mapfiles\ncp *.map mapfiles/\n```\n\nIf a line in the script starts with a `#` character, it will be skipped,\nand rest of the line is considered as a comment (except for\nthe first line that starts with `#!`).\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# This is a comment line that is not executed\n\nmkdir mapfiles\ncp *.map mapfiles/\n```\n\nAfter saving the script file and closing the editor, you can perform the\ncommands in the script file by giving the command:\n\n```bash\nsource my_test.script\n```\n\nOptionally, you could give execution permissions for your script file\nwith the command\n\n```bash\nchmod u+x my_test.script\n```\n\nand then execute the script with the command:\n\n```bash\n./my_test.script\n```\n\n## Variables and arrays\n\nYou can use variables, loops and conditional statements in the scripts.\nVariables can be set with syntax:\n\n```bash\nvariable=value\n```\n\nNote that there are no spaces around the equals sign. Variables are recalled\nwith `$` sign,\n\n```bash\n$variable\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n${variable}\n```\n\nFor example, the command\n\n```bash\necho $variable\n```\n\nwrites the value of variable to the output. Note that in bash scripts\nthe variables are considered to be either strings (i.e. text) or\nintegers. This means that decimal numbers can't be used in bash\nscripts for mathematical operations.\n\nExample of using string variables:\n\n```bash\n$ name=Veikko\n$ familyname=Salo\n$ address=\"CSC Espoo\"\n$ echo \"Person: ${name} ${familyname} works at ${address}.\"\n\nPerson: Veikko Salo works at CSC Espoo.\n```\n\nFor integer variables, you can do simple arithmetic with syntax\n`((expression))`. Commonly used arithmetic operations are listed in\nthe table below:\n\n| Operator | Function           |\n|----------|--------------------|\n| `+`      | addition           |\n| `-`      | subtraction        |\n| `*`      | multiplication     |\n| `/`      | division           |\n| `%`      | division remainder |\n| `**`     | exponentiation     |\n\nSimple integer arithmetic examples:\n\n```bash\n$ a=5\n$ c=3\n$ ((c = a + b))\n$ echo  $a plus $b is equal to $c\n5 plus 3 is equal to 8\n$ ((d = a / b))\n$ ((e = a % b))\n$ echo \"$a divided by $b results $d and reminder $e\"\n5 divided by 3 results 1 and reminder 2\n```\n\nBash can also use one-dimensional array variables, i.e. variables that contain\na list of items. A\nspecified array item can be recalled by using an index number in\nbrackets with the array variable name `(${variable[index]})`. For\nexample, we can define a simple three element array with the command:\n\n```bash\narray=(a b c)\n```\n\nWe can now recall either the whole array or just on element from it using\nthe command\n\n```bash\necho ${array[*]} \n```\n\nThis prints out\n\n```bash\na b c\n```\n\nwhile command\n\n```bash\necho ${array[2]}\n```\n\nprints\n\n```bash\nc\n```\n\nNote that in the array, the indexing starts from 0 and thus the sample\ncommand above prints out the third element of the array. You can check\nthe number of items in the array by adding the `#` sign to the beginning of\nthe variable name. For example, in this case the command\n\n```bash\necho ${#array[*]}\n```\n\nprints out the value\n\n```bash\n3\n```\n\nA special case of array variables is `$` that holds command line\narguments, i.e. items that you can provide as input parameters for your\nscript. In the case of this argument, array `$0` refers to the name of the\nactual script, `$1` refers to the first arguments, `$2` to the second and so\non. `$#` refers to the number of arguments and `$@` to the full argument\nlist.
