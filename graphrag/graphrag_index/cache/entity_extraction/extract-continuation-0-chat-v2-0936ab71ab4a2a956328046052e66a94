Some applications use only one core by default, even if\nmore are reserved.\n\nOther applications may try to use all cores in the node, even if only some\nare reserved. The environment variable `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`, which stores the\nvalue of `--cpus-per-task`, can be used instead of a number when specifying the\namount of cores to use. This is useful as the command does not need to be\nmodified if the `--cpus-per-task` is changed later.\n\nFinally, use the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to set the number of\nthreads the application uses. For example,\n\n```bash\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n```\n\n## MPI-based batch jobs\n\nIn MPI jobs, each task has its own memory allocation. Thus, the tasks can be\ndistributed over multiple nodes.\n \nSet the number of MPI tasks with:\n\n``` bash\n#SBATCH --ntasks=<number_of_mpi_tasks>\n```\n \nIf more fine-tuned control is required, the exact number of nodes and number of\ntasks per node can be specified with `--nodes` and `--ntasks-per-node`,\nrespectively. This is typically recommended in order to avoid tasks spreading\nover unnecessary many nodes,\n[see Performance checklist](./performance-checklist.md#limit-unnecessary-spreading-of-parallel-tasks-in-puhti).\n\nIt is recommended to request memory using the `--mem-per-cpu` option.\n\n!!! info \"Running MPI programs\"\n    - MPI programs **should not** be started with `mpirun` or `mpiexec`. Use\n      `srun` instead.\n    - An MPI module has to be loaded in the batch job script for the program\n      to work properly.\n\n## Hybrid batch jobs \n\nIn hybrid jobs, each task is allocated several cores. Each task then uses some\nparallelization, other than MPI, to do the work. The most common strategy is\nfor every MPI task to launch multiple threads using OpenMP. To request more\ncores per MPI task, use the argument `--cpus-per-task`. The default value is\none core per task.\n\nThe optimal ratio between the number of tasks and cores per tasks varies for\neach application. Testing is required to find the right combination for your\napplication.\n\n!!! info \"Threads per task in hybrid MPI/OpenMP jobs\"\n    Set the number of OpenMP threads per MPI task in your batch script using\n    the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` environment variables:\n\n    ```bash\n    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n    ```\n\n## Additional resources in batch jobs\n\n### Local storage\n\nSome nodes on Puhti have fast local storage space (NVMe) available for jobs.\nUsing local storage is recommended for I/O-intensive applications, i.e. jobs\nthat, for example, read and write a lot of small files.\n[See more details](../disk.md#temporary-local-disk-areas).\n\nLocal storage is available on:\n\n* GPU nodes in the `gpu` and `gputest` partitions (max. 3600 GB per node)\n* I/O nodes shared by the `small`, `large`, `longrun` and `interactive`\n  partitions (max. 1490/3600 GB per node)\n* BigMem nodes in the `hugemem` and `hugemem_longrun` partitions (max. 5960 GB\n  per node)\n\nRequest local storage using the `--gres` flag in the batch script:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:<local_storage_space_per_node_in_GB>\n```\n\nThe amount of space is given in GB (check maximum sizes from the list above).\nFor example, to request 100 GB of storage, use option `--gres=nvme:100`. The\nlocal storage reservation is on a per-node basis.\n\nUse the environment variable `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` in your batch job scripts to\naccess the local storage space on each node. For example, to extract a large\ndataset package to the local storage:\n\n```bash\ntar xf my-large-dataset.tar.gz -C $LOCAL_SCRATCH\n```\n\n!!! warning \"Remember to recover your data\"\n    The local storage space reserved for your job is emptied after the job has\n    finished. Thus, if you write data to the local disk during your job, please\n    remember to move anything you want to preserve to the shared disk area at\n    the end of your job. Particularly, the commands to move the data must be\n    given in the batch job script as you cannot access the local storage space\n    anymore after the batch job has completed. For example, to copy some output\n    data back to the directory from where the batch job was submitted:\n\n    ```bash\n    mv $LOCAL_SCRATCH/my-important-output.log $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR\n    ```\n\n### GPUs\n\nPuhti has 320 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs. The GPUs are available in the `gpu` and\n`gputest` partitions and can be requested with:\n\n```bash\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:<number_of_gpus_per_node>\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Environment variable that stores the value of --cpus-per-task, used to specify the amount of cores for a task)##\n(\"entity\"<|>OMP_NUM_THREADS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Environment variable used to set the number of threads an application uses, often matched with the number of reserved cores)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Message Passing Interface, a standard for parallel programming, used in MPI-based batch jobs where each task has its own memory allocation)##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Open Multi-Processing, a parallel programming interface used in hybrid jobs for launching multiple threads per MPI task)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Computing environment where nodes have fast local storage space available for jobs, including GPU nodes, I/O nodes, and BigMem nodes)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Non-Volatile Memory Express, fast local storage space available on some nodes in Puhti for I/O-intensive applications)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA TESLA V100<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Model of GPUs available in Puhti, used in the gpu and gputest partitions)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK<|>OMP_NUM_THREADS<|>Both environment variables are used to manage and optimize the performance of parallel tasks in batch jobs<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MPI<|>OPENMP<|>MPI and OpenMP are used together in hybrid batch jobs for parallel processing<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>NVME<|>Puhti nodes offer NVMe local storage for I/O-intensive applications<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>NVIDIA TESLA V100<|>Puhti has Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs available for computational tasks<|>9)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
