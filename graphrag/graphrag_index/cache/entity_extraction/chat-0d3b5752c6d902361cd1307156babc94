[Build your own container](#building-containers-on-local-hardware) on your\n   local hardware, e.g. your laptop.\n\n### Building containers using the cotainr tool\n\n[Cotainr][cotainr] is a tool that makes it easy to build Singularity/Apptainer\ncontainers on LUMI for certain [use cases][cotainr-usecases]. It is **not** a\ngeneral purpose container building tool.\n\nOn LUMI, `cotainr` is available in the \n[Cray Programming Environment][lumi-software-stack] and may be loaded using\n\n```bash\n$ module load CrayEnv\n$ module load cotainr\n```\n\nWhen building containers using `cotainr build`, you may either specify a base\nimage for the container yourself (using the `--base-image` option) or you may\nuse the `--system` option to use the recommended base images for LUMI. To list\nthe available systems, run\n\n```bash\n$ cotainr info\n...\n\nSystem info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAvailable system configurations:\n    - lumi-g\n    - lumi-c\n```\n\nAs an example, you may then use `cotainr build` to create a container for\n[LUMI-G][lumi-g] containing a Conda/pip environment by running\n\n```bash\n$ cotainr build my_container.sif --system=lumi-g --conda-env=my_conda_env.yml\n```\n\nwhere `my_conda_env.yml` is a file containing an [exported Conda\nenvironment][conda-env]. The resulting `my_container.sif` container may be run\nlike any other [container job][container-jobs] on LUMI. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ srun --partition=<partition> --account=<account> singularity exec my_container.sif python3 my_script.py\n```\n\nwhere `my_script.py` is your Python script.\n\nThe installed Conda environment is automatically activated when you run the\ncontainer. See the [cotainr Conda environment docs][cotainr-conda-env] and the\n[cotainr LUMI examples][cotainr-lumi-examples] for more details.\n\n!!! warning \"Make sure your Conda environment supports the hardware in LUMI\"\n    To take advantage of e.g. the GPUs in [LUMI-G][lumi-g], the\n    packages you specify in your Conda environment must be compatible with\n    LUMI-G, i.e. built against ROCm. Similarly, to take full advantage\n    of the [Slingshot 11 interconnect][interconnect] when running MPI jobs, you\n    must make sure your packages are built against Cray MPICH. Cotainr does\n    **not** do any magic conversion of the packages specified in the Conda\n    environment to make sure they fit the hardware of LUMI. It simply installs\n    the packages exactly as listed in the `my_conda_env.yml` file.\n\n!!! note\n    Using `cotainr` to build a container from a Conda/pip environment is\n    different from wrapping a Conda/pip environment using the [LUMI container\n    wrapper][container-wrapper]. Each serves their own purpose. See\n    the [Python installation guide][python-packages] for an overview of\n    differences and [this GitHub issue][tykky-cotainr-diff] for a detailed\n    discussion of the differences.\n\nSee the [cotainr documentation][cotainr] for more details about `cotainr`.\n\n### Building containers on local hardware\n\nYou may also build a Singularity/Apptainer container for LUMI on your local\nhardware and [transfer it to LUMI][copying-files].\n\nAs an example, consider building a container that is compatible with the\nMPI stack on LUMI.\n\n!!! warning\n    For MPI-enabled containers, the application inside the container must be\n    dynamically linked to an MPI version that is [ABI-compatible][mpich-abi]\n    with the host MPI.\n\nThe following [Singularity definition file][singularity-def-file]\n`mpi_osu.def`, installs MPICH-3.1.4, which is ABI-compatible with the\nCray-MPICH found on LUMI. That MPICH will be used to compile the [OSU\nmicro-benchmarks][osu-benchmark]. Finally, the OSU point to point bandwidth test\nis set as the \"runscript\" of the image.\n\n```bash\nbootstrap: docker\nfrom: ubuntu:21.04\n\n%post\n    # Install software\n    apt-get update\n    apt-get install -y file g++ gcc gfortran make gdb strace wget ca-certificates --no-install-recommends\n\n    # Install mpich\n    wget -q http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.1.4/mpich-3.1.4.tar.gz\n    tar xf mpich-3.1.4.tar.gz\n    cd mpich-3.1.4\n    ./configure --disable-fortran --enable-fast=all,O3 --prefix=/usr\n    make -j$(nproc)\n    make install\n    ldconfig\n\n    # Build osu benchmarks\n    wget -q http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/download/mvapich/osu-micro-benchmarks-5.3.2.tar.gz\n    tar xf osu-micro-benchmarks-5.3.2.tar.gz\n    cd osu-micro-benchmarks\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
