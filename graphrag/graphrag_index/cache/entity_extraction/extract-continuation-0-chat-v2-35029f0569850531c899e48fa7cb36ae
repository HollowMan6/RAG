The warnings will say something like: \"We detected N errors during the execution.\n  Please check the logs, for more information!\"\n  The errors indicate which line number the problematic text was on, so you can go\n  and check it manually.\n    - Tip: To print only a specific line, e.g., line 123 of the `path_summary.txt`, you can use\n      this command: `sed -n 123p /path/to/path_summary.txt`\n- To capture the logging of `lcleaner`, you can redirect the standard error output stream into\n  a file. This may be useful if you experience problems, and would like help to troubleshoot\n  the situation.\n    - `lcleaner --log-level debug path_summary.txt 2> ~/lcleaner-debug-$(date +%s).log`\n- The use of `-0` both with `lcleaner` and `xargs` in the example commands on this page is\n  recommended in order to avoid problems with file names that include whitespace.\n- LCleaner also has some administrative functionality, which is not intended and in some cases\n  will not work for unprivileged users. Anything which mentions the `--admin-mode` flag can safely\n  be ignored.\n\n### Troubleshooting LCleaner\n\nIf you notice any bugs, please report them to [CSC Service Desk](../contact.md).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LCLEANER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LCleaner is a tool used for managing and cleaning file paths in a computing environment, specifically designed to work with files in a scratch directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI-LOGIN11<|>GEO<|>Puhti-login11 is a computing node or server where LCleaner commands are executed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY_PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A placeholder for a user's project directory within the scratch directory structure, indicating a specific area for project-related files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATH_SUMMARY.TXT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A text file containing a summary of file paths targeted by the LCleaner tool for cleaning or management)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LCLEANER<|>PUHTI-LOGIN11<|>LCleaner commands are executed on the Puhti-login11 server<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LCLEANER<|>MY_PROJECT<|>LCleaner operates on files within the my_project directory, indicating a direct relationship between the tool's function and the project's file management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LCLEANER<|>PATH_SUMMARY.TXT<|>LCleaner processes the path_summary.txt file to manage or clean up files, showing a direct use of this file by the tool<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
