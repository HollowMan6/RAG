Upon completion, the output is moved to the user's home directory using a `FileTransferTask`. To illustrate dependencies, the workflow is composed of two identical Fireworks of which the second is launched only after the first one has completed. This connection is enforced using the `links` section. See the official documentation for a more in depth description on [how to design FireWorks workflows](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/workflow_tutorial.html).\n\nThe steps to execute this example workflow through the batch queue system consist of resetting the LaunchPad, adding the workflow YAML file to the database and, finally, submitting the workflow using the `qlaunch` command.\n\n```console\n$ lpad reset\nAre you sure? This will RESET 1 workflows and all data. (Y/N)\n2022-02-14 11:42:59,323 INFO Performing db tune-up\n2022-02-14 11:42:59,496 INFO LaunchPad was RESET.\n\n$ lpad add hello_wf.yaml\n2022-02-14 11:43:32,144 INFO Added a workflow. id_map: {1: 1, 2: 2}\n\n$ qlaunch singleshot\n2022-02-14 11:44:09,835 INFO moving to launch_dir /path/to/launch_dir\n2022-02-14 11:44:09,847 INFO submitting queue script\n```\n\nBased on the content of the `my_qadapter.yaml` file, FireWorks creates a submission script `FW_submit.script` and automatically submits it when `qlaunch` is run. The `singleshot` option is used above to launch a single batch job. If you have multiple workflows in your LaunchPad ready to be executed, you can use the `rapidfire` option to execute them all as separate batch jobs.\n\n!!! Note\n    The `rapidfire` mode is designed such that it will continuously pull jobs from the LaunchPad that are marked as `READY`. This state applies also for jobs that have already been submitted, but are still queueing. Consequently, too many workflows can accidentally be submitted to the queue! To avoid duplicates, the `-m` and `--nlaunches` options can be used to limit the number of simultaneous jobs in the queue and the total number of jobs to be submitted, respectively. See the official FireWorks documentation on [how to launch jobs through a queue](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/queue_tutorial.html) for further details.\n\nAlthough `qlaunch` is run instead of the basic `rlaunch` command that is normally used in the absence of a batch queue system, `rlaunch` is still used inside the `my_qadapter.yaml` file to instruct FireWorks how the workflow should be run *within* the batch job. In the above case, the `multi 1` option is used to launch a single parallel job using all the requested resources. The `multi` launcher is designed to spawn a specified number of workers that run FireTasks with identical resources requirements in parallel. If more than one worker is specified, `srun` commands issued within any `ScriptTask` must be modified to use the appropriate amount of tasks/threads together with the `--exclusive` option so that the jobs are actually able to run concurrently within the same resource allocation. For example if one full Puhti node (40 cores) is requested for running two concurrent jobs (`multi 2`) with the same number of MPI tasks, the FireTasks should read `srun -n 20 --exclusive <my program>`. However, beware of idling resources if the FireTasks complete asynchronously! For further details on running parallel jobs using FireWorks, see the [official documentation on the multi job launcher](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/multi_job.html).\n\n!!! Note\n    Each time `srun` is issued, a SLURM job step is created. If your workflow is composed of a large number of FireTasks in which `srun` is used, the SLURM log will get bloated, risking degrading the performance of the batch queue system. If unavoidable, consider using `orterun` instead of `srun` to launch your parallel jobs through the queue, or use another workflow tool that packs your tasks within a single large job step. Note also that serial jobs do not require the usage of `srun`. Don't hesitate to [contact our Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) if you're unsure about the efficiency of your workflow.\n\n### Step 4. Monitoring the state of your workflow\n\nAfter running `qlaunch` you'll see that your job has been submitted to the queue, and using the `lpad get_fws` command you're able to [query the current state of your workflow](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/query_tutorial.html). Before the job starts running, the command will show that the first Firework is marked as `READY` to be run, while the second one is `WAITING` because we told FireWorks not to launch it before the first one has completed.\n\n```console\n$ lpad get_fws\n[\n    {\n        \"fw_id\": 1,\n        \"created_on\": \"2022-02-14T09:43:31.941934\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FILETRANSFERTASK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A task in the workflow designed to move the output file to the user's home directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCRIPTTASK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A built-in task in FireWorks used to execute the MPI parallelized hello_mpi.x program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELLO_MPI.X<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program executed as part of the workflow to demonstrate MPI parallelization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A workflow framework used to design and execute the described workflow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAUNCHPAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A database component of FireWorks used to manage workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QLAUNCH<|>EVENT<|>A command used to submit the workflow to the batch queue system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAPIDFIRE<|>EVENT<|>A mode of qlaunch that executes multiple workflows as separate batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing resource mentioned in the context of running parallel jobs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILETRANSFERTASK<|>HELLO_MPI.X<|>FileTransferTask moves the output of hello_mpi.x to the user's home directory<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCRIPTTASK<|>HELLO_MPI.X<|>ScriptTask is used to execute the hello_mpi.x program<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>SCRIPTTASK<|>FireWorks includes ScriptTask as a built-in task for executing programs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>FILETRANSFERTASK<|>FireWorks includes FileTransferTask as a built-in task for moving files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAUNCHPAD<|>FIREWORKS<|>LaunchPad is a component of FireWorks for managing workflows<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QLAUNCH<|>LAUNCHPAD<|>qlaunch is used to submit workflows from LaunchPad to the batch queue system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAPIDFIRE<|>QLAUNCH<|>rapidfire is a mode of qlaunch for executing multiple workflows<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
