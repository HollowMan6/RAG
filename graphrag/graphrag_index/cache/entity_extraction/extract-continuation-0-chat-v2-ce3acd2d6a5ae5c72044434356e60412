Log in and out to Puhti via SSH client to ensure you have a home directory.\n2. Download the configuration script archive [`mps_puhti.zip`](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/cscjemma/MATLAB+MPS+configuration) for Puhti.\n3. Create a local MATLAB configuration directory.\n4. Extract the configurations to the configuration directory.\n5. Add the directory to the unzipped configuration files to MATLAB's path using `addpath` and `savepath` functions in MATLAB.\n6. Configure your MATLAB to submit jobs to Puhti by calling `configCluster` in MATLAB and supply your username to the prompt.\n\n\n#### Linux and MacOS\nStep 3: Run in shell:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p \"$HOME/.matlab\"\n```\n\nStep 4: Run in shell:\n```bash\nunzip \"$HOME/Downloads/mps_puhti.zip\" -d \"$HOME/.matlab\"\n```\n\nStep 5: Run in MATLAB:\n```matlab\naddpath(fullfile(getenv(\"HOME\"), \".matlab\", \"mps_puhti\"))\nsavepath\n```\n\nStep 6: Run in MATLAB:\n```matlab\nconfigCluster\n```\n\n#### Windows\nStep 3: Run in Windows Powershell:\n\n```powershell\nNew-Item -Path \"$env:APPDATA\\Mathworks\\MATLAB\" -ItemType Directory -Force \n```\n\nStep 4: Run in Windows Powershell:\n```powershell\nExpand-Archive -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\Downloads\\mps_puhti.zip\" -DestinationPath \"$env:APPDATA\\Mathworks\\MATLAB\"\n```\n\nStep 5: Run in MATLAB:\n```matlab\naddpath(fullfile(getenv(\"APPDATA\"), \"Mathworks\", \"MATLAB\", \"mps_puhti\"))\nsavepath\n```\n\nStep 6: Run in MATLAB:\n```matlab\nconfigCluster\n```\n\n\n### Submitting serial jobs\nBefore submitting the batch job, we have to specify the resource reservation using `parcluster`.\nBecause the `parcluster` is stateful, it is safest to explicitly unset properties we don't use by setting them to the empty string `''`.\nFurthermore, `CPUsPerNode` is set automatically by the `batch` command, thus we unset it.\nFor example, a simple CPU reservation looks as follows:\n\n```matlab\nc = parcluster;\n% Replace 'project_id' to your project identifier, otherwise the script will fail.\nc.AdditionalProperties.ComputingProject = 'project_id';\nc.AdditionalProperties.Partition = 'small';\nc.AdditionalProperties.WallTime = '00:15:00';\nc.AdditionalProperties.CPUsPerNode = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.MemPerCPU = '4g';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GpuCard = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GPUsPerNode = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.EmailAddress = '';\n```\n\nNow, we can use the [`batch`](http://se.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/batch.html) function to submit a job to Puhti.\nIt returns a job object which we can use to access the output of the submitted job.\n\nThe first time you submit a job, MATLAB will prompt you whether to use a password or an SSH key for authentication.\n\n1. If you choose to use a password, MATLAB will ask your password to Puhti.\n2. If you choose to use an SSH key, MATLAB will ask the path the your private key and whether the key requires a password.\n   MATLAB stores the path to your key and will not ask for it later.\n\nWe can submit a simple test job that returns the current working directory as follows:\n\n```matlab\nj = batch(c, @pwd, 1, {}, 'CurrentFolder', '.', 'AutoAddClientPath', false)\n```\n\nIn the example, we set the working directory to the home directory by setting `'CurrentFolder'` to `'.'`.\nAlso, we should disable MATLAB from adding the local MATLAB search path to the remote workers by setting `'AutoAddClientPath'` to `false`.\n\n\n### Submitting parallel jobs\nLet's create a reservation:\n\n```matlab\nc = parcluster;\n% Replace 'project_id' to your project identifier, otherwise the script will fail.\nc.AdditionalProperties.ComputingProject = 'project_id';\nc.AdditionalProperties.Partition = 'small';\nc.AdditionalProperties.WallTime = '00:15:00';\nc.AdditionalProperties.CPUsPerNode = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.MemPerCPU = '4g';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GpuCard = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.GPUsPerNode = '';\nc.AdditionalProperties.EmailAddress = '';\n```\n\nNow, we can use the batch command to create a parallel pool of workers by setting the `'Pool'` argument to the amount of cores we want\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MATLAB PARALLEL SERVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service that allows users to run parallel MATLAB code on the Puhti cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing cluster where MATLAB Parallel Server can send batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARPOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A MATLAB function to start a parallel pool of workers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCLUSTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A MATLAB function used for specifying resource reservation for batch jobs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATLAB PARALLEL SERVER<|>PUHTI<|>MATLAB Parallel Server sends batch jobs to the Puhti cluster<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARPOOL<|>MATLAB PARALLEL SERVER<|>Parpool is used within MATLAB Parallel Server to manage parallel workers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARCLUSTER<|>MATLAB PARALLEL SERVER<|>Parcluster is used to specify resource reservations for jobs submitted through MATLAB Parallel Server<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
