For example, the `kakoune` editor built in the previous example can be\nsearched and loaded with:\n\n```bash\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ module spider kakoune\n\n--------------------------------\n  kakoune: kakoune/2021.11.08-gcc-11.3.0-yh4n\n--------------------------------\n\n    This module can be loaded directly: module load kakoune/2021.11.08-gcc-11.3.0-yh4n\n\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ module load kakoune/2021.11.08-gcc-11.3.0-yh4n\n```\n\n## Further reading\n\n- [Official Spack documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n- [Spack tutorial](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)\n- [Spack GitHub repository](https://github.com/spack/spack)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
