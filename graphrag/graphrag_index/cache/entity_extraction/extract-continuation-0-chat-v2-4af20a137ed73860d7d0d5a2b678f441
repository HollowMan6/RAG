This page will start with a short introduction\non how to use Valgrind for this purpose. Then, we present how to use it for a\nparallel code.\nSee also the Cray documentation page about [debugging tools in Cray Programming Environment](https://cpe.ext.hpe.com/docs/#debugging-tools). \n\n## Valgrind\n\nThe [Valgrind][valgrind] memcheck tool is a tool for memory debugging and\nmemory leak detection. Valgrind monitors access, allocation, and deallocation\nof memory and allows you to debug the following problems:\n\n- bad memory accesses\n- uses of uninitialized values\n- memory leaks\n- double frees or mismatched frees\n- overlapping source and destination memory blocks to memory copy functions\n\nTo use Valgrind, compile you application with the debug flag (`-g`) so that\nValgrind can point you to the faulty lines of code.\n\n```bash\n$ cc -g -o my_app source.c\n```\n\nNext, run your application with Valgrind\n\n```bash\n$ module load valgrind4hpc\n$ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./my_app\n```\n\n!!! warning\n    When using Valgrind, your application will run much slower than normal and\n    use more memory. Take this into consideration when you set up your job.\n\nValgrind also include a heap profiler named `massif`. This tool measures how\nmuch heap memory your program uses and can be invoked with the following\ncommand\n\n```bash\n$ valgrind --tool=massif ./my_app\n```\n\nSee also:\n\n- Valgrind memcheck [documentation][memcheck-doc]\n- Valgrind massif [documentation][massif-doc]\n\n### Valgrind4HPC\n\nDebugging serial applications with Valgrind is quite straightforward. However,\nfor a parallel application with multiple ranks, the output can become messy.\nThat is where Valgrind4hpc comes in handy.\n\nValgrind4hpc aggregates any duplicate messages across ranks to help provide an\nunderstandable picture of program behavior. Valgrind4hpc manages starting and\nredirecting output from many copies of Valgrind, as well as deduplicating and\nfiltering Valgrind messages.\n\nTo use Valgrind4hpc you have to load the module\n\n```bash\n$ module load valgrind4hpc\n```\n\nThe next step is to launch your application with Valgrind4hpc. It will take care\nof running your application through Slurm. The general form of the command is:\n\n```bash\n$ valgrind4hpc <valgrind4hpc options> <program-name> -- arg1 arg2\n```\n\nIf your application does not take arguments, the `--` at the end is optional.\nThe table below summarizes the basic options that you can use with Valgrind4hpc.\n\n| Option                        | Description\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| `--num-ranks=<num ranks>`     | Specify the number of ranks to run             |\n| `--launcher-args=<arguments>` | Arguments to the application launcher (`srun`) |\n| `--valgrind-args=<arguments>` | Specify Valgrind arguments                     |\n| `--from-ranks=<ranks>`        | Only show Valgrind output from certain ranks   |\n\nFor example, to run your application with rank 16 on two nodes, the command will be\n\n```bash\n$ valgrind4hpc --num-ranks=16 \\\n               --launcher-args=\"--account=<project> -N2 --ntasks-per-node=8\" \\\n               --valgrind-args=\"--leak-check=full\" \\\n               ./my_application -- <args>\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VALGRIND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Valgrind is a tool for memory debugging and memory leak detection that monitors access, allocation, and deallocation of memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cray Programming Environment provides documentation and tools for debugging, including memory debugging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALGRIND4HPC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Valgrind4hpc is a tool that aggregates duplicate messages across ranks for parallel application debugging, managing starting and redirecting output from many copies of Valgrind)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VALGRIND<|>CRAY PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT<|>Valgrind is mentioned as a memory debugging tool in the Cray Programming Environment documentation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VALGRIND4HPC<|>VALGRIND<|>Valgrind4hpc is an extension of Valgrind designed for parallel application debugging<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
