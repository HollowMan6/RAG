The easiest way to create a custom pip environment is by using the `venv`\n       module discussed in the\n       [previous section](python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules),\n       which actually shows precisely how to do this. If you do not wish to use\n       packages from one of the existing modules, simply do not include\n       the  \n       `--system-site-packages` flag when creating the virtual environment.\n\n    2. Another option is to create a pip environment inside a\n       [container](../../computing/containers/overview.md).\n       The most straightforward way to do so is by using the\n       [Tykky container wrapper](../../computing/containers/tykky.md).\n       To find out how to easily containerize your environment,\n       see the\n       [Tykky instructions for pip-based installations](../../computing/containers/tykky.md#pip-based-installations).\n\n    3. An alternative to using Tykky is creating a pip environment\n       inside a custom Apptainer container. This is a practical choice if, for\n       example, you know of a suitable ready-made Apptainer or Docker container.\n       For more information about using Apptainer containers, please see the\n       related documentation:\n\n        * [Running Apptainer containers](../../computing/containers/run-existing.md)\n        * [Creating Apptainer containers](../../computing/containers/creating.md),\n        including how to convert Docker containers to Apptainer containers.\n\n    ---\n\n=== \"conda\"\n    Conda is easy to use and flexible, but it usually creates a huge number of files which\n    is incompatible with shared file systems. The excess of files can cause\n    very slow library imports and,\n    in the worst case, slows down the whole file system. Because of this,\n    [**CSC has deprecated the use of conda**](conda.md)\n    for direct installations on supercomputers.\n    However, you can still create and use\n    [containerized](../../computing/containers/overview.md)\n    conda environments.\n\n    1. The most straightforward way to create a containerized conda\n       environment is by using the\n       [Tykky container wrapper](../../computing/containers/tykky.md).\n       To find out how to easily containerize your environment,\n       see the\n       [Tykky instructions for conda-based installations](../../computing/containers/tykky.md#conda-based-installation).\n\n    2. An alternative to using Tykky is creating a conda environment\n       inside a custom Apptainer container. This is a practical choice if, for\n       example, you know of a suitable ready-made Apptainer or Docker container.\n       For more information about using Apptainer containers, please see the\n       related documentation:\n\n        * [Running Apptainer containers](../../computing/containers/run-existing.md)\n        * [Creating Apptainer containers](../../computing/containers/creating.md),\n        including how to convert Docker containers to Apptainer containers.\n\n    ---\n\n## Python development environments\n\nPython scripts can be edited directly on a CSC supercomputer using a\n[console-based text editor](./env-guide/text-and-image-processing.md)\nlike `vim` or `emacs`. In addition to these terminal-based editors,\nseveral graphical programming environments,\nsuch as Jupyter notebooks, Visual Studio Code and Spyder,\ncan be used on a supercomputer through\n[our web interface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md).\n\nIn addition to editing code directly on a supercomputer, it is also\npossible to [develop code remotely](./remote-dev.md) using some\nlocally installable editors like Visual Studio Code.\n\nFinally, one can of course edit code on a local device\nand copy it to a supercomputer with command-line tools like\n[`scp`](../../data/moving/scp.md) and\n[`rsync`](../../data/moving/rsync.md),\nor by using\n[graphical file transfer tools](../../data/moving/graphical_transfer.md).\n\n### Jupyter\n\n[Jupyter notebooks](../../apps/jupyter.md) provide an interactive\nprogramming environment where one can\nwrite and run Python code in individual cells.\nThe notebooks combine code, equations, visualizations and narrative text\nin a single document. \n\nThe [Jupyter interactive application](../../computing/webinterface/jupyter.md)\non our web interface allows using Jupyter on CSC supercomputers.\nMany of our Python environments, including\n[`python-data`](../../apps/python-data.md), [`geoconda`](../../apps/geoconda.md)\nas well as deep learning modules like [`pytorch`](../../apps/pytorch.md)\ninclude the main Jupyter packages, so they can be used in the application.\nThe documentation page for the application includes a\n[list of supported environments\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WHATSHAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software tool encountering an error due to a bad interpreter path)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Python interpreter that needs to be correctly linked in the whatshap executable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package manager for Python that can be used to create custom environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package manager that has been deprecated by CSC for use on supercomputers due to its inefficiency with shared file systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A container wrapper used at CSC for creating containerized environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A container technology that can be used to create custom environments, previously known as Singularity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An interactive computing environment that enables users to create Jupyter notebooks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The IT center for science in Finland that provides supercomputing resources)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHATSHAP<|>PYTHON3<|>Whatshap requires a correct link to the Python3 interpreter to function properly<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIP<|>PYTHON3<|>Pip is used to manage Python environments, which are based on Python3<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDA<|>CSC<|>Conda has been deprecated by CSC for direct installations on supercomputers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY<|>CSC<|>Tykky is a container wrapper provided by CSC for creating containerized environments<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER<|>CSC<|>Apptainer containers can be used on CSC's supercomputers for creating custom environments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER<|>CSC<|>Jupyter notebooks can be used on CSC supercomputers through the web interface<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
