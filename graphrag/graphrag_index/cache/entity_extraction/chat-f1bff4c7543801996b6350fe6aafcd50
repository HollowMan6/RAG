The decision on what are the most important factors depends heavily on the task and the resources available. The following list summarizes what one needs to consider when defining the data needs:\n\n* Sensor: Different sensors cover different intervals of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum and with that show different properties of the observed areas, they can be active or passive:\n    * Multispectral: multiple intervals around the visible spectrum of the EM are observed at the same time\n    * Hyperspectral: more but usually shorter intervals of the EM are observed at the same time\n    * RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging), SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), active sensing in the microwave/radio frequencies of the EM spectrum\n    * LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), using a laser as energy source in the optical part of the EM spectrum \n    * Note that depending on the wavelengths observed, clouds, ground conditions and atmospheric artifacts may result in data gaps\n* Resolution\n    * Temporal: when and how often a certain area is revisited\n    * Spatial: the area on the ground that each pixel covers, determining the size of the smallest possible feature that can be detected\n    * Spectral: the area of the electromagnetic spectrum that is observed and spectral width of each band provided\n    * Radiometric: number of bits used to represent the energy recorded (bit-depth)\n* Costs:\n    * Some EO data is freely available as open data\n    * Some commercial datasets might be possible to get for free/less for research\n* Preprocessing level\n    * Raw data - can have different levels and often need to be processed before it can be used for reliable analysis\n    * Different levels of preprocessed data - make sure you are aware of what kind of preprocessing has been performed on your data\n    * Analysis ready data (ARD)\n    * Mosaics\n* User experience and knowledge\n    * Appropriate background knowledge required for many tasks\n    * ARD is \"ready to go\", but be aware of what preprocessing has been performed on your data\n  \n\n### Some widely used EO datasets\n\n|Name|Max resolution, m|Revisit time, days|Years of operation|Open data|\n|--------------|------------|-----|---------|---------|\n|**Multispectral**|\n|**[ESA, Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)**|10-60|5|2015->|Yes|\n|**[NASA, Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/)**|15-120|8|1972->|Yes|\n|[ESA, Proba-V](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/catalog/proba-v-1km-333m-and-100m-products)|100-1000|1-2|2013->|Yes|\n|[Airbus, Spot](https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/imagery/constellation/spot/)|1.5|-|1986->|No|\n|[Planet, several satellites ](https://www.planet.com/products/planet-imagery/)|0.5-5|-|2009-> |No*|\n|[DigitalGlobe, WorldView](http://worldview3.digitalglobe.com/)|0.3-30|-|1997->|No|\n|[Airbus, Pleiades](https://pleiades.cnes.fr/en/PLEIADES/index.htm)|0.3-0.5|-|2012->|No|\n||||||\n|**Hyperspectral**|||||\n|**[NASA, MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)**|250-100|1-2|1999->|Yes|\n|[NASA, EO-1](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1)|10-30|-|2000-2017|Yes|\n||||||\n|**Radar, SAR**|||||\n|**[ESA, Sentinel 1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1)**|5|6|2014->|Yes|\n|[ESA, Radarsat](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/radarsat/)|1-100|24|1995->|Yes|\n|[TanDEM-X](https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects-and-missions/tandem-x)/[TERRASAR-X](https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects-and-missions/terrasar-x)|0.25-40|-|2010->|No|\n|[ICEYE](https://www.iceye.com/)|0.5-2.5|1|2018->|No|\n||||||\n|**LiDAR**|Footprint size||||\n|[NASA, ICESat2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/)|13|91|2019->|Yes|\n|[NADA, GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/)|25|-|2018->|Yes|\n\n\\* See [Planets page for education and research](https://www.planet.com/markets/education-and-research/) for limited, non-commercial access to PlanetScope and RapidEye imagery.\n\n!!! default \"EO database\"\n\n    Database of all EO missions and instrument information can be found in the [CEOS EO handbook database](http://database.eohandbook.com/database/instrumenttable.aspx).
