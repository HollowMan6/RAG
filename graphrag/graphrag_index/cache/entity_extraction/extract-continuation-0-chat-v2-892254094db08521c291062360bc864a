Name the file `fit.R`\n\nYou can use e.g. `nano` editor, which you need to initialize first\nwith `module load nano` (in the interactive node, in the login node,\nit is available without the module load command).\n\nMake sure the file is ok with:\n```\ncat fit.R\n```\nYou should see three lines with the R commands.\n\n### c) Run the script interactively\n\n```\napptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save --no-restore -f fit.R\n```\n\n### d) Results\n- **Did the job succeed?**\n- **What are the fit coefficients?**\n\n## Simple R job as a batch job \n\nNow run the previous R script as a batch job.\n\n### a) Create a batch job script, which will submit the job to the queue.\n\nCopy the *serial batch script* template from [CSC's R-env page](../../../apps/r-env/#serial-batch-jobs)\ninto a file called _batch.sh_\n\nIn addition to setting up the computing requirements, this script\nalso resets some additional R environment variables. These won't\nbe necessary, if you run some other application. Always check first\nif there's a template batch script for your application, and use that\nas the base for your own script.\n\nFor this example, you'll need to make three changes. Replace the _<project>_ \nplaceholder in the `--account` and `echo \"TMPDIR=/scratch/...`\nlines with your own computing project. And finally, at the end of the script, \nreplace (`myscript.R`) i.e. the R-script to be executed to `fit.R`.\n\n### b) Submit the batch script with\n\n```\nsbatch batch.sh\n```\n\n### c) Did the job succeed? Where are the fit constants?\n\n\n## Run tens of R batch jobs as an array job\n\nIn this example, we will repeat the previous fitting job for 20 datasets \nusing the array job functionality of SLURM. Note, that for such short \njobs it would not make sense to run them as separate batch jobs, but \nyou could loop over them in one job or better inside the R script.\n\n### a) Prepare a list of files to process.\n\nGo to the folder named `r-array`. Create there a file called\n`datanames.txt`. This file will contain the names of all those files\nthat will be used as input to the fitting. Run the following commands to\ncreate it.\n\n``` \ncd data_dir\nls \nls > ../datanames.txt\n```\n\n### b) Write the R script, that will do the fitting.\n\nGo back to the r-array folder, create a script named `modelscript.R`\nand put the following commands to it (you can copy the previous script\nand edit that, or start from scratch).\n\n```\ndataname <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)\nmydata <- read.csv(paste0(\"data_dir/\",dataname))\nfit <- lm(y~x,mydata)\nwrite(fit$coefficients,\nfile=paste0(\"result_dir/\",dataname,\"_result.txt\"))\n```\n\nThe first line will extract from the batch command the name of the\ndataset to be fitted. The next line reads that data into the variable\nmydata. Then we fit, like in the previous example, and finally write the\ncoefficients into a file.\n\n### c) Create a batch script to submit the job.\n\nName it `R_array.sh`. Copy the contents from the previous example.\nAdd the following line among the other lines starting #SBATCH:\n\n```\n#SBATCH --array=1-20\n```\n\nIt will ask SLURM to run an array of 20 jobs. Edit the output and error\nfiles to go to their own *directories* and files by editing/adding\n(`%a` will be replaced with the number of the array job):\n\n```\n#SBATCH --output=out/output%a.txt\n#SBATCH --error=err/errors%a.txt\n```\n\nChange the SLURM partition to be used (`--partition=`) from _test_ to _small_.\n\nBefore the line with `srun apptainer_wrapper...`, add the following line\n\n```\ndataname=$(sed -n \"$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID\"p datanames.txt)\n\n```\nand edit the line to run the R command into:\n\n```\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save modelscript.R $dataname\n```\n\nYou should now have:\n\n   1. `datanames.txt`, which has the names of your datafiles\n   1. `modelscript.R`, which contains the R code to do the fitting\n   1. `R_array.sh`, which is the batch script to submit the job\n   1. (and the folders `out, err, data_dir, result_dir` which were there already)\n\n### d) run the batch script with\n\n```\nsbatch R_array.sh\n```\nSince you're now running 20 jobs, they might take a moment in the queue.\nYou should get the fit coefficients in separate files in the\n`result_dir`. Let's now use interactive R to look at the results.\n\n### e) Collect the results and plot them.\n\nNote, plotting will work only if you have \n[remote X11 forwarding](../../computing/connecting/index.md#graphical-connection).\nActually, for R, there is even a tailored remote setup using \n[RStudio Server\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the provided instructions and the nature of the text, it appears there are no explicit entities (organization, person, geo, event) or relationships described within the text.
