in the container.\nTo do so, Slurm needs to be instructed to use the PMI-2 process management\ninterface by passing `--mpi=pmi2` to `srun`, e.g.\n\n```bash\n$ srun --partition=<partition> --account=<account> --mpi=pmi2 --nodes=2 singularity run mpi_osu.sif\n```\n\nwhich produces an output along the lines of\n\n```text\n# OSU MPI Bandwidth Test v5.3.2\n# Size      Bandwidth (MB/s)\n1

is the case when using the host MPI. In general, the\nperformance obtained from using the container MPI might be quite low compared\nto the results obtained when using the host's MPI.
