To force purge these jobs, run:\n\n```bash\n$SCHRODINGER/jobcontrol -delete -force <jobid>\n```\n\nbefore running the above `jserver` commands. `<jobid>` should be replaced by the\nID of your stranded job, for example `puhti-login11-0-626be035`.\n\nAnother reason for jobs ending up fizzled is too many simultaneous jobs. Please have a look at the\nerror files for suggestions, and if this is the case, ask for less subjobs.\n\n## Run a test job to help diagnosing problems\n\nRun one of the test jobs that come with Maestro to narrow down\npotential issues. In your scratch directory on Puhti, give\n\n```bash\ninstallation_check -test test\n```\n\nto try running a test job using the `test` HOST. If the test succeeds,\nthe problem is likely in your input. In this case, please proceed to the\n_postmortem_ step below.\n\n## Asking for support\n\nMaestro has a tool called _postmortem_ that can be used to create a zip file\ncontaining the details of a failed job and the Maestro environment. Please add\nthat to your support request to help us analyze your issue. On Puhti, first run:\n\n```bash\njobcontrol -list \n```\n\nto find the right JobId (something like `puhti-login11-0-4d34ce08`). Then,\ncheck the right flags for `postmortem` with:\n\n```bash\n$SCHRODINGER/utilities/postmortem -h\n```\n\nand create the postmortem file with:\n\n```bash\n$SCHRODINGER/utilities/postmortem <your schrodinger jobid>\n```\n\nThe file may be large, so instead of sending it as an email attachment, consider\nusing [a-flip](../../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md#a-flip) and just sending\na link instead. Also, see the previous recommendation to first start\n[testing with small systems](#how-to-speed-up-simulations), as this will also enable\nyou to use the `test` HOST and avoid queueing.\n\nPlease have a look at our [instructions on writing support requests](../support-howto.md).\nAn efficient support request will help us to solve your issue faster.\n\n## Recap of Maestro usage on Puhti\n\n1. Always test your workflow first with a **small** sample.\n      * Please mind the [Slurm partition limits](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md).\n2. Don't run the Maestro GUI on a login node.\n      * If you _must_ run the GUI on Puhti, use the Puhti web interface _Desktop_ app.\n3. Don't specify too many subjobs – an optimal subjob takes 1-24 hours.\n4. Don't specify too many subjobs – there are many researchers using the same license.\n5. Don't run a heavy \"driver process\" on the login node\n      * If the driver process is heavy, use e.g. `-HOST \"longrun:1 normal_72h:9\"` for 10 subjobs.\n6. Never run anything in parallel on the login node.\n      * Do not use `localhost` in your script unless you write your own batch script or run\n        Maestro in an [interactive session](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md).\n7. Submit all jobs from your `/scratch` area.\n8. If your local computer uses Windows, edit `\\` to `/` in your script.\n9. Use the same version of Maestro locally and on Puhti.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCHRODINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Schrodinger provides computational software for drug discovery and materials science)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JSERVER<|>EVENT<|>A command to shutdown Schrodinger's job server)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOBCONTROL<|>EVENT<|>A command to manage jobs in Schrodinger's software, including force deletion of jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A supercomputer in Finland where Schrodinger software is used)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A graphical user interface and simulation management tool of Schrodinger software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTALLATION_CHECK<|>EVENT<|>A command to run test jobs in Schrodinger's software to diagnose problems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTMORTEM<|>EVENT<|>A tool in Schrodinger's software to create a detailed report of a failed job)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JSERVER<|>SCHRODINGER<|>Jserver is a command related to the operation of Schrodinger's software<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOBCONTROL<|>SCHRODINGER<|>Jobcontrol is a command for managing jobs within Schrodinger's software<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTRO<|>SCHRODINGER<|>Maestro is a part of Schrodinger's suite of tools for computational tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTALLATION_CHECK<|>SCHRODINGER<|>Installation_check is a diagnostic tool within Schrodinger's software<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POSTMORTEM<|>SCHRODINGER<|>Postmortem is a tool used for generating reports on failed jobs in Schrodinger's software<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTRO<|>PUHTI<|>Maestro is used on the Puhti supercomputer for computational tasks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POSTMORTEM<|>MAESTRO<|>Postmortem is a tool used within Maestro to analyze failed jobs<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
