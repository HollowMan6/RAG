Before QPUs can be utilized, they require tailor-made programs \nand algorithms. The [Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure](https://fiqci.fi) FiQCI provides access to\nquantum computing resources through CSC's service portals.\n\n## Helmi\n\n**5 Qubit Quantum Computer**\n\nHelmi, the first Finnish quantum computer, is co-developed by VTT and IQM Quantum Computers. Presently, Helmi provides 5 qubits. With Helmi, users can run quantum programs and algorithms on a real, physical device.\n\nAccess to Helmi is provided through the LUMI supecomputer environment. Users will need to apply for a quantum computing project on LUMI, which gives access to Helmi through the LUMI job scheduler (SLURM). Applying for a project is done through [MyCSC](../../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project/).\n\nFor further reading:\n\n* [A more technical description about Helmi](./helmi/helmi-specs.md).\n* [Specific instructions for the LUMI Helmi partition](./helmi/fiqci-partition.md)\n* [Getting started with Helmi](./helmi/helmi-from-lumi.md)\n* [LUMI Documentation page](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/)\n\n\n## Kvasi\n\n**The Quantum Learning Machine**\n\nKvasi is an advanced quantum computer simulator/emulator. With Kvasi, the user can explore and develop algorithms \nfor quantum computers. Read here [detailed instructions on how to access](../quantum-computing/kvasi/kvasi.md)\n\nKvasi provides an ecosystem for developing and simulating quantum algorithms in both \nideal and realistic, noisy conditions. With Kvasi, you can optimize your algorithm \nfor a specific hardware (QPU), with specific qubit connectivity and basic gate operations.\n\nThe algorithms can be developed either at a level close to the hardware, using \nthe Atos Quantum Assembler (AQASM) language, or using a higher level, Python based \nlanguage and ready-made libraries. The QLM comes with several ready-made examples.\nYou can also download and run locally [myQLM](../quantum-computing/kvasi/kvasi.md#myqlm) - a light-weight version of the \nQLM ecosystem.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FINNISH QUANTUM-COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FiQCI provides access to quantum computing resources through CSC's service portals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The first Finnish quantum computer, co-developed by VTT and IQM Quantum Computers, offering 5 qubits for running quantum programs and algorithms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Co-developer of Helmi, the first Finnish quantum computer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IQM QUANTUM COMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Co-developer of Helmi, the first Finnish quantum computer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supercomputer environment providing access to Helmi through a job scheduler)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KVASI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An advanced quantum computer simulator/emulator for exploring and developing quantum algorithms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATOS QUANTUM ASSEMBLER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A language for developing algorithms at a level close to the hardware)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYQLM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A light-weight version of the QLM ecosystem for local download and use)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELMI<|>VTT<|>VTT is a co-developer of Helmi<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELMI<|>IQM QUANTUM COMPUTERS<|>IQM Quantum Computers is a co-developer of Helmi<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELMI<|>LUMI<|>Access to Helmi is provided through the LUMI supercomputer environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KVASI<|>ATOS QUANTUM ASSEMBLER<|>Kvasi allows development of algorithms using the Atos Quantum Assembler language<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KVASI<|>MYQLM<|>myQLM is a part of the Kvasi ecosystem for local use<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
