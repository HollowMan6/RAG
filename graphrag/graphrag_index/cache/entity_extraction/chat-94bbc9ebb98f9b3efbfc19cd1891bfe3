For demanding computation,\nlike running full-scale simulations or training neural networks, you should use\nthe command-line interface, since it allows you to access more resources and\nschedule your jobs.\n\n- [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)\n- [Mahti web interface](https://www.mahti.csc.fi)\n- [LUMI web interface](https://www.lumi.csc.fi)\n\n### Command-line interface\n\nWhile many of the interactive applications in the web interface, such as\nJupyter and RStudio, are easy to use and thus a good starting point for using\nCSC supercomputers, their computing capacity is limited to relatively\nlow-resource interactive usage. If you need access to more resources (e.g.\nmultiple CPU nodes or GPUs) or if your work requires efficiency over\ninteractivity, it is a good idea to switch to using the text-based command-line\ninterface to interact directly with the supercomputer's\n[Linux operating system](./env-guide/index.md). While this way of working may\nseem archaic, it is truly powerful once you get used to it.\n\nThe CLI allows you to \n[submit your computations as batch jobs](../../computing/running/getting-started.md)\nto the SLURM job scheduler, which runs them as soon as the requested resources\nare available. Importantly, the batch job system ensures that your jobs are run\non the *compute nodes* opposed to the *login nodes*,\nwhich are [**not** intended for heavy computing](../../computing/usage-policy.md).\nAnother benefit of batch jobs is that running computations does not necessitate\nbeing tied to your workstation. While setting up this automation can require\nsome more planning on your part, in the long run it makes your work more\nefficient as well as more reproducible both to yourself and other parties, such\nas reviewers and collaborators.\n\nYou can access the command-line interface either by\nusing the [shell applications](../../computing/webinterface/shell.md)\nfeatured in the web interfaces or by\n[using an SSH client on your own workstation](../../computing/connecting/index.md).\n\n## How to work with software and data?\n\n### Software\n\nA variety of useful [scientific computing software](../../apps/index.md) is\navailable on CSC supercomputers. Puhti is especially distinguished in this\nregard, having over a hundred pre-installed programs. Our application pages\ninclude batch job script examples and guidelines for running the software\nefficiently on CSC supercomputers. We highly recommend using them as a\nstarting point!\n\nCSC supercomputers use [environment modules](../../computing/modules.md) for\nmanaging software environments. These modules cover everything from\n[compilers](../../computing/installing.md#compiling) and\n[programming languages](../../apps/by_discipline.md#mathematics-and-statistics)\nto workflow utilities like\n[Nextflow](../../apps/nextflow.md) and [Snakemake](../../apps/snakemake.md).\nRunning most of the installed software efficiently requires using the\n[command-line interface](#command-line-interface), so it is extremely useful to\nhave a working knowledge of the\n[basics of the Linux operating system](./env-guide/index.md).\n\nWhile the pre-installed software covers a wide variety of use cases, it is also\npossible to install your own applications on CSC supercomputers. The process\noften differs from carrying out installations on your own computer, so make\nsure to familiarize yourself with our\n[installation instructions](../../computing/installing.md). For compiling HPC\napplications we have various\n[compilers](../../computing/installing.md#compiling),\n[high-performance libraries](../../computing/hpc-libraries.md) and other\nutilities available to facilitate this. Note that some installations, such as\ncomplex Python environments, benefit from\n[containerization](../../computing/containers/overview.md).\n\nYou may also wish to develop your own scripts and programs instead of using existing\nsoftware. It is most efficient to start writing and testing your code on your\nown device, since running it on a shared system (which supercomputers are)\ninevitably introduces some overhead. You should only start running your scripts\non a supercomputer once you are ready for testing them on a larger scale or\nusing specific resources like GPUs.\n\n!!! note \"Checking availability\"\n\n    If you have a piece of scientific software in mind, it is quite probable\n    that we have it installed on Puhti. Besides browsing Docs CSC, you can search\n    for software on the command-line using the command\n    `module spider <search-pattern>`. Most often the name of the software module\n    is simply the name of the software itself, and even if your search pattern\n    does not match the module name exactly, the search is case-insensitive and\n    supports partial matches.\n\n### Data storage\n\nCSC supercomputers provide distinct [disk areas](../../computing/disk.md) for\ndifferent data storage purposes. The *project-based* shared storage can be found\nunder `/scratch/<project>`. This folder is shared by *all users* in a project\nand has a default quota of 1 TB.\n\nPlease note that the **scratch disk is not meant for long-term data storage**\nand, on Puhti, files that have not been used for 180 days will be automatically\nremoved. We recommend the\n[Allas object storage service](../../data/Allas/introduction.md) for storing\nresearch data that is not actively used on the supercomputers. See\n[guidelines for managing data on Puhti and Mahti scratch disks](clean-up-data.md)\nfor more information\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
