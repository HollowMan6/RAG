The central software\nstack is kept as compact as possible to ease maintenance and to avoid user\nconfusion. E.g., packages for which users request special customisations will\nnever be installed in the central software stack. Moreover, due to the\ntechnical implementation of a software stack on a system the size of LUMI,\nsome software maintenance operations in the stack can be disruptive and\nonly be done during system maintenance intervals, making maintenance \ndifficult.\n\nThis, however, does not mean that you may have to wait for weeks before you can\nget the software you need for your project on LUMI. We have made it very easy to\ninstall additional software in your home or project directories (where the\nlatter is a better choice as you can then share it with the other people in your\nproject). After installing, using the software requires not much more than loading a module\nthat configures EasyBuild for local installations and running EasyBuild with a\nfew recipes that can be supplied by the [User Support Team][helpdesk] or your\nnational support team or that you may write yourself. And this software is then\nbuilt in exactly the same way as it would be in a central installation.\n\n*Before continuing to read this page, make sure you are familiar with the\n[setup of the software stacks on LUMI][softwarestacks] and somewhat familiar\nwith [the Lmod module environment][Lmod_modules].*\n\n## Beginner's guide to installing software on LUMI\n\n*If you are new to EasyBuild and LUMI, it might be a good idea to first read \nthrough this chapter once, and then start software installations.*\n\nWe support installing software with EasyBuild only in the LUMI software stacks,\nnot in CrayEnv.\n\n\n### EasyBuild recipes\n\nEasyBuild installs software through recipes that give instructions to create a single\nmodule that most of the time provides a single package.\nIt will also tell EasyBuild which other modules a package depends on,\nso that these can also be installed automatically if needed (through their own EasyBuild recipes).\n\nAn EasyBuild build recipe is a file with a name that consists of different\ncomponents and ends with '.eb'. Consider, e.g., a build recipe for the software GROMACS:\n\n```text\nGROMACS-2022.5-cpeGNU-23.09-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU.eb\n```\n\nThe first part of the name, `GROMACS`, is the name of the package. The second\npart of the name, `2022.5` is the version of GROMACS, in this case the\n2021.4 release. \n\nThe next part, `cpeGNU-23.09`, denotes the so-called *toolchain*\nused for the build. Each toolchain corresponds to a particular HPE Cray Programming\nEnvironment, and the number (`23.09`in this example) denotes the version of this\nprogramming environment. The various EasyBuild toolchains on LUMI are:\n\n| EasyBuild toolchain | HPE Cray PE                                                    |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `cpeGNU`            | `PrgEnv-gnu` (GNU compilers)                                   |\n| `cpeCray`           | `PrgEnv-cray` (HPE Cray's own compilers)                       |\n| `cpeAMD`            | `PrgEnv-amd` (AMD compilers for AMD GPU systems, part of ROCm) |\n| `cpeAOCC`           | `PrgEnv-aocc` (AMD compilers for CPU-only systems)             |\n\nThe version number of the toolchain should match the version\nof the LUMI software stack or the installation will fail. (In fact, it is not\njust the version in the file name that should match but the version of the\ntoolchain that is used in the recipe file.) \n\nThe last part of the name,\n`-PLUMED-2.9.0-noPython-CPU`, is called the version suffix. Version suffixes are\ntypically used to distinguish different builds of the same package version.\nIn this case, it indicates that it is a build of the 2022.5 version\npurely for CPU and also includes PLUMED as we have also builds without PLUMED\n(which is not compatible with every GROMACS version).\n\nEasyBuild build recipes are stored in repositories with a fixed directory \nstructure. On LUMI we already provide two such repositories,\none containing all the software that is installed in the central software\nstack and one that contains EasyBuild recipes that users can install\nthemselves or use as a basis to make a customised installation of software.\nAn overview of all recipes in these repositories is provided in the\n[LUMI Software Library][software-library].\n\nWe encourage advanced users to also build up a user repository with their\nown EasyBuild recipes and manage it with a version control system as\nthat will provide a good description of the software stack that was \nused for a project and is a good step towards reproducibility. \nThis is discussed below in the [\"Advanced\nguide\"](#advanced-guide-to-easybuild-on-lumi), section [\"Building your own\nEasy\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EASYBUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EasyBuild is a software installation framework used for installing software in the LUMI software stacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer environment that utilizes EasyBuild for software management and installations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER SUPPORT TEAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A team that provides assistance and recipes for software installation on LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROMACS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GROMACS is a software package for simulations in computational chemistry, installed using EasyBuild on LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CrayEnv refers to the Cray Environment, which is not supported for software installations with EasyBuild on LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI SOFTWARE STACKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The collection of software installed centrally on LUMI, managed through EasyBuild)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI SOFTWARE LIBRARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A repository containing EasyBuild recipes for software that can be installed on LUMI)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EASYBUILD<|>LUMI<|>EasyBuild is used exclusively for software installations within the LUMI software stacks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER SUPPORT TEAM<|>LUMI<|>The User Support Team assists LUMI users with software installations, providing EasyBuild recipes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROMACS<|>LUMI SOFTWARE STACKS<|>GROMACS is an example of software installed in the LUMI software stacks using EasyBuild<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI SOFTWARE STACKS<|>LUMI<|>The LUMI software stacks are a central part of the LUMI supercomputer environment, managed through EasyBuild<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI SOFTWARE LIBRARY<|>LUMI SOFTWARE STACKS<|>The LUMI Software Library provides EasyBuild recipes for software installation in the LUMI software stacks<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
