Amount and location of CPU cores and GPUs, memory limits, local storage, job lifetime, etc.\n   - Information recorded in an internal Slurm job accounting database\n- Large number of short (<30 min) jobs generate lots of accounting data and scheduling uses more resources than the actual jobs!\n- To avoid:\n   - Large number of (short) *jobs* (`sbatch` commands)\n   - Large number of *job steps* (`srun` commands)\n   - Polling Slurm commands (`squeue`, `sacct`, etc. commands)\n\n# Workflows and Lustre\n\n- Workflows quite often involve processing large datasets, which can be problematic for parallel file systems like Lustre at CSC\n- To avoid:\n   - Accessing lots of small files, having many files in a single directory\n     - Recall the issues caused by Conda!\n   - Large files on a single object storage target (i.e. no [striping](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/lustre/#file-striping-and-alignment))\n   - Opening and closing a file in a rapid pace\n     - Includes database operations\n   - Using file locks for synchronization\n     - Writing to same file from many nodes\n\n# How much is too much?\n\n- It is hard to give exact numbers as Slurm and Lustre are *shared* resources\n   - When total system load is low, it may be OK to run something that is problematic when system is full\n- How many jobs/steps is too many?\n   - <span style=\"color:green\">**SHOULD BE OK**</span> to run tens of jobs/steps\n   - <span style=\"color:orange\">**PAY ATTENTION**</span> if you run hundreds of jobs/steps\n   - <span style=\"color:red\">**DON'T RUN**</span> several thousands of jobs/steps\n- How many file operations is too many?\n   -

For 100+ jobs, regroup your tasks and execute them in a single job (step)\n- Check the tool you're using, there may be built-in support for running many tasks within a single job step (best option!)\n  - E.g. [GROMACS multidir](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/gromacs-throughput/), [CP2K farming](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/cp2k/#high-throughput-computing-with-cp2k)\n  - Also [Python](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python/#python-parallel-jobs) and [R](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/parallel-r/) if you write your own code\n- External tools: Array jobs*, HyperQueue\n  - [Array jobs](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/array-jobs/) are simply a Slurm feature for submitting many jobs from a single batch script -- **don't submit hundreds of short jobs!**\n  - [HyperQueue](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/hyperqueue/) is a *meta-scheduler*, which allows you to pack many (non-MPI) jobs within a single job step (recommended!)\n\n# If you have lots of small jobs and/or files (2/2)\n\n- In more complex cases (dependencies, error handling), workflow managers such as [Nextflow](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/nextflow/), [Snakemake](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/snakemake/) or [FireWorks](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/fireworks/) can be used\n  - HyperQueue integration for Nextflow and Snakemake already available!\n  - See [Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/throughput/) for more details\n- When working with lots of small files:\n  - Check the tool you're using, there may be different options for data storage\n  - [Tar/untar and compress your datasets](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/env-guide/packing-and-compression-tools/), use [SquashFS](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/run-existing/#mounting-datasets-with-squashfs) for read-only datasets and containers\n  - Use local disks: [NVMe](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/#compute-nodes-with-local-ssd-nvme-disks) on Puhti, [ramdisk (`/dev/shm`)](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/#compute-nodes-without-local-ssd-nvme-disks) on Mahti\n  - Remove intermediate files if possible\n\n# Summary (1/2)\n\n- Different codes may give very different performance for a given use case\n   - Compare the options you have in [CSC's software selection](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)\n- Before launching massive jobs, start with small\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm is a workload manager used for submitting, scheduling, and managing jobs on a computer cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, generally used for large-scale cluster computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC refers to a computing center that provides resources and support for computing tasks, likely involved with Slurm and Lustre systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROMACS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GROMACS is a software package for simulating molecular dynamics, mentioned for its ability to run multiple tasks within a single job step)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CP2K<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CP2K is a software package used for atomistic simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular, and biological systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python is a programming language that supports parallel jobs, as mentioned in the context of running many tasks within a single job step)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics, mentioned for parallel computing capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HyperQueue is described as a meta-scheduler that allows packing many non-MPI jobs within a single job step)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXTFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nextflow is a workflow manager for computational pipelines, with HyperQueue integration mentioned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Snakemake is a workflow management system that organizes and executes analysis pipelines, with HyperQueue integration mentioned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FireWorks is a workflow manager designed to make it easier to launch and track computational jobs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM<|>CSC<|>Slurm is used at CSC for job scheduling and management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUSTRE<|>CSC<|>Lustre is used at CSC for managing parallel file systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROMACS<|>CSC<|>GROMACS is available as part of CSC's software selection for molecular dynamics simulations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CP2K<|>CSC<|>CP2K is part of the software offerings at CSC for atomistic simulations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>CSC<|>Python is supported at CSC for running parallel jobs and tasks within a single job step<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R<|>CSC<|>R is supported at CSC for statistical computing and parallel computing tasks<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERQUEUE<|>CSC<|>HyperQueue is recommended by CSC as a meta-scheduler for packing many jobs within a single step<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEXTFLOW<|>CSC<|>Nextflow, with HyperQueue integration, is recommended by CSC for managing computational pipelines<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAKEMAKE<|>CSC<|>Snakemake, with HyperQueue integration, is recommended by CSC for workflow management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>CSC<|>FireWorks is mentioned as a workflow manager supported by CSC for running computational jobs<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
