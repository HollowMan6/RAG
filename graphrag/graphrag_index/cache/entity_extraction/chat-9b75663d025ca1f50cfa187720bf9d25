The running virtual\nmachine is removed and cannot be recovered.\n\n##### Associate public address\n\n    openstack floating ip create public\n\nA public address must first be allocated from a pool of addresses. At\nthis point, the IP address has not been assigned to any host.\n\n    openstackÂ server add floating ip <server> <address>\n\nThis command assigns the address that was just allocated to a virtual\nmachine.\n\nWhen you no longer need the public address, you can release it to the\npublic pool by deletingÂ it.\n\n    openstack floating ip delete <address>\n\nBy doing this, you save billing units and maintain an efficient use of\npublic IPs.Â \n\n##### Authorization to connect to virtual machines\n\nCreate a new security group:\n\n    openstack security group create <security group name>\n\nAdd a rule to this new group that allows ping from a specific\nsource network:\n\n    openstack security group rule create --proto icmp --remote-ip <source network> --dst-port 0 <security group name>\n\nAdd a rule that allows SSH from a specific source network:\n\n    openstack security group rule create --proto tcp --remote-ip <source network>Â --dst-port 22Â <security group name>\n\nAssign the newly created security group to your virtual server:\n\n    openstack server add security group <server> <security group name>\n\nBy default, all connections to virtual machines are blocked.

You specify if you want to\nuse a specific group when launching a server.\n\nA server group with an affinity rule guarantees that all virtual\nmachines launched in the group are launched on the same physical\nserver. A server group with an anti-affinity rule guarantees that all\nservers in the group are launched on different physical servers. If no\nsuitable physical server is found, the virtual machine will not be\ncreated.\n\n    openstack server group create --policy <affinity or anti-affinity> <server group name>\n\nAfter that, you can launch virtual machines in the group by\nspecifying the group ID in the hint parameter.\n\n    openstack server create --flavor <flavor> --image <image id> --key-name <key name> --hint group=<server group id> <name for machine>\n\nCheck which virtual machines belong to the server group:\n\n    openstack server group show <server group id>\n\n### External documentation\n\n[A more comprehensive openstack CLI reference](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
