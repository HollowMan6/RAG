Upload the public key file to the server, from a Linux or Mac machine you can use `SCP` (Secure copy protocol):\n\n       ```sh\n       scp id_rsa.pub <default_user>@<floating_ip>:\n       ```\n\n       Note: The `<default_user>` is still the one found in the [image documentation](/cloud/pouta/images/#images)\n\n1. Make sure that the special SSH configuration directory exists:\n\n\t```sh\n\tmkdir -p ~<user>/.ssh\n\t```\n\n\tAgain, substitute `<user>` with the username you just created. For example, for the user `pepe` the command would be: `mkdir -p ~pepe/.ssh`.\n\n1. make a backup of the `authorized_keys` file (this is optional but recommended):\n\n\t```sh\n\tcp ~<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys ~<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys.$(date +%s)\n\t```\n\n1. Add the public key to the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n\t```sh\n\tcat id_rs.pub >> ~<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\t```\n1. Make sure the permissions are right:\n\n\t```sh\n\tchmod 700 ~<user>/.ssh\n\tchmod 600 ~<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\t```\n\n1. Finally, check that the `authorized_keys` file looks like it should, with one public key per line.\n\nThe new person can now follow the [connecting to a VM](/cloud/pouta/connecting-to-vm/) article. The command (in Linux and Mac) should be something like the following:\n\n```sh\nssh -i id_rsa <user>@<floating_ip>\n```\n\n## Give access to the same user to several public keys\n\nIt could be a good practice to give access to the same user at the same VM to more than one SSH key pair. For example, if the same person has different devices, each device will have a different private key, and if one of the devices gets lost, only one of the keys has to be deleted from `authorized_keys`. For this use case, it is possible to use the [ssh-copy-id](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-copy-id) tool. This tool will only work if you already have access to that user at that VM.\n\n```sh\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <user>@<floating_ip>\n```\n\nThe file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is the new SSH key to add.\n\n!!! warning \"Do not give access to the same user name to different people\"\n    It is not a good practice to give access to different people to the same user. This is because it makes it almost impossible to audit who and when connected to the VM.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
