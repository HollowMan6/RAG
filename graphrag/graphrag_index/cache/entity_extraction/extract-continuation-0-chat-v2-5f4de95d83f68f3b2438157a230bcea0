However, the encrypted datasets may contain large amounts\nof files and in those cases doing encryption or decryption file-by-file\ncan be too laborious.\n\nThis document provides simple scripting examples to\nillustrate how decryption process can be automatized.\nIn practice automatized decryption process requires two\nfunctionalities:\n\n  1. Constructing a loop that finds encrypted files\n  and executes decryption command.\n\n  2. A method that automatically provides the decryption password to\n  decryption commands.\n\nIn the examples below we assume that we have a directory\nnamed as _data1_. The directory contains hundreds of files\nof which the encrypted files have _.c4gh_ suffix. The encryption\nis done so that decryption can be done with secret key _my-key.sec_\nthat is protected with password: _badpasswd_.\n\n\n## Decryption using bash script in Mac and Linux\n\nIn Linux and Mac machines `crypt4gh`command line tool is able\nto read the password of the private key from environment variable\nC4GH_PASSPHRASE. Thus the first step is set this variable. In bash shell\nthis could in this case be done with commands:\n\n```bash\nread C4GH_PASSPHRASE\nexport C4GH_PASSPHRASE\n```\n\nFind command can be used to list all files that end with\n_.c4gh_ in a given directory (_data1_) and its' subdirectories.\nThis list can be used as an input for a _for loop_.\n\n```bash\nfind data1 -name *.c4gh\n```\n\nInside the loop  we need to define a name for the decrypted file. I this case\nwe use command pipeline _rev | cut -c6- | rev_  to cut away the five last\ncharacter of the encrypted filename ( i.e .c4gh ) to define a filename\nfor decrypted data.\n\nThe actual decryption is done with command:\n\n```bash\ncrypt4gh decrypt --sk my-key.sec < encrypted-file > decrypted-file\n```\n\nWith these steps, the complete script could look like following:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Give the password of my-key.sec\"\nread C4GH_PASSPHRASE\nexport C4GH_PASSPHRASE\n\nfor f_encrypted in $(find data1 -name *.c4gh)\ndo\n  echo \"Decrypting $f_encrypted\"\n  #define the file name for the decrypted data\n  f_decrypted=$(echo $f_encrypted | rev | cut -c6- | rev)\n  crypt4gh decrypt --sk my-key.sec < \"$f_encrypted\" > $f_decrypted\ndone\n```\n\nThe script could be executed with commands:\n\n```bash\n  chmod u+x decryption_script\n  ./chmod u+x decryption_script\n```\n\n\n## Decryption using windows PowerShell\n\nCryp4gh is available for Windows machines too, but the windows version\nis not able read the secret key password from environment variable.\nBecause  of that  we need to use _sda-cli.exe_ command instead.\nIn this case the password can be stored in variable C4GH_PASSWORD.\n\nSda-cli.exe command can be downloaded from:\n[https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli/releases](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli/releases)\n\nOnce the command is available, the decryption can be done with following\nPowerShell commands. Here we assume that the data to be decrypted is in\ndirectory _E:\\data1_.\n\n```powershell\n$env:C4GH_PASSWORD = \"badpasswd\"\n$files = (Get-ChildItem -Path 'E:\\data1\\'*.c4gh -Recurse).fullname\n\nforeach ($f in $files) {\n.\\sda-cli decrypt -key .\\my-key.sec $f  }\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crypt4gh is a tool for encrypting and decrypting files, particularly used for datasets containing large amounts of files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASH SCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>A scripting method used in Mac and Linux environments for automating the decryption process of files with the .c4gh suffix)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS POWERSHELL<|>EVENT<|>A scripting method used in Windows environments for automating the decryption process of files with the .c4gh suffix)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA1<|>GEO<|>A directory assumed to contain hundreds of files, including encrypted files with the .c4gh suffix)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY-KEY.SEC<|>PERSON<|>The secret key protected with a password used for decryption in the examples provided)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C4GH_PASSPHRASE<|>PERSON<|>An environment variable used to store the decryption password in Linux and Mac environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C4GH_PASSWORD<|>PERSON<|>A variable used to store the decryption password in Windows PowerShell scripts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>BASH SCRIPT<|>Crypt4gh is utilized within Bash scripts for decrypting files in Mac and Linux<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRYPT4GH<|>WINDOWS POWERSHELL<|>Crypt4gh is utilized within Windows PowerShell scripts for decrypting files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA1<|>BASH SCRIPT<|>The Bash script is used to decrypt files within the Data1 directory<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA1<|>WINDOWS POWERSHELL<|>Windows PowerShell scripts are used to decrypt files within the Data1 directory<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY-KEY.SEC<|>BASH SCRIPT<|>The Bash script uses My-Key.sec for decrypting files<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY-KEY.SEC<|>WINDOWS POWERSHELL<|>Windows PowerShell scripts use My-Key.sec for decrypting files<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C4GH_PASSPHRASE<|>BASH SCRIPT<|>C4GH_PASSPHRASE is set and used in the Bash script for decryption<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C4GH_PASSWORD<|>WINDOWS POWERSHELL<|>C4GH_PASSWORD is used in the PowerShell script for decryption<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
