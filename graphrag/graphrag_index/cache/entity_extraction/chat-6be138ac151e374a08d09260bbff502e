Note however that there are other bioinformatics tools on Puhti that have separate setup commands.\nOnce biokit module is loaded, Minimap2 starts with the command:\n\n```bash\nminimap2\n```\n\nWithout any options, `minimap2` takes a reference database and a query sequence file as input and produce approximate mapping, without base-level alignment (i.e. no CIGAR), in the PAF format:\n\n```bash\nminimap2 ref.fa query.fq > approx-mapping.paf\n```\n\nIf you wish to get the output in SAM format, you can use option `-a`.\n\nFor different data types, Minimap2 needs to be tuned for optimal performance and accuracy.\nWith option `-x` you can use case specific parameter sets, pre-defined and recommended by the Minimap2 developers.\n \n### Map long noisy genomic reads (_map-pb_ and _map-ont_)\n\n* PacBio subreads (_map-db_):\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax map-pb ref.fa pacbio-reads.fq > aln.sam\n```\n\n* Oxford Nanopore reads (_map-ont_):\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax map-ont ref.fa ont-reads.fq > aln.sam \n```\n\n### Map long mRNA/cDNA reads (splice)\n\n* PacBio Iso-seq/traditional cDNA\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax splice -uf ref.fa iso-seq.fq > aln.sam\n``` \n\n* Nanopore 2D cDNA-seq\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax splice ref.fa nanopore-cdna.fa > aln.sam\n```\n\n* Nanopore Direct RNA-seq\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax splice -uf -k14 ref.fa direct-rna.fq > aln.sam\n```\n \n* mapping against SIRV control\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax splice --splice-flank=no SIRV.fa SIRV-seq.fa\n```\n\n### Find overlaps between long reads (_ava-pb_ and _aca-ont_)\n\n* PacBio read overlap\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -x ava-pb reads.fq reads.fq > ovlp.paf\n```\n\n* Oxford Nanopore read overlap\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -x ava-ont reads.fq reads.fq > ovlp.paf\n```\n\n### Map short accurate genomic reads (sr)\n\nNote, Minimap2 does not work well with short spliced reads.\n\n* single-end alignment\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax sr ref.fa reads-se.fq > aln.sam\n```\n\n* paired-end alignment\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax sr ref.fa read1.fq read2.fq > aln.sam\n```\n\n* paired-end alignment\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax sr ref.fa reads-interleaved.fq > aln.sam \n```\n\n### Full genome/assembly alignment (_asm5_)\n\n* assembly to assembly\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -ax asm5 ref.fa asm.fa > aln.sam\n```\n\n## Example batch script for Puhti\n\nOn Puhti, Minimap2 jobs should be run as batch jobs. Below is a sample batch job file\nfor running a Minimap2 paired-end alignment on Puhti.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=minimap2\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=04:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --mem=16000\n\nmodule load biokit\nminimap2 -t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -ax splice -uf ref.fa iso-seq.fq > aln.sam\n```\n\nIn the batch job example above, one task (`--ntasks=1`) is executed. The Minimap2 job\nuses 8 cores (`--cpus-per-task=8`) with a total of 16 GB of memory (`--mem=16000`).\nThe maximum duration of the job is four hours (`--time=04:00:00`). All the cores\nare assigned from one computing node (`--nodes=1`). In addition to the resource\nreservations, you have to define the billing project for your batch job. This\nis done by replacing the `<project>` with the name of your project. You can\nuse command `csc-projects` to see what projects you have on Puhti.\n\nYou can submit the batch job file to the batch job system with the command:\n\n```bash\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
