Next, we go to the `genomes` directory:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2001659/genomes\n```\n\nInstead of `a-put` that was used in the previous example, we use command\n`rclone copyto` to copy all files from the given directory to Allas. In the\ncase of `rclone`, there is no default bucket. Instead, we have to define a\nbucket. In this example, we use the bucket name `2001659-genomes` and define\neach object name to have the prefix `zebrafish`.\n\n```text\nrclone copyto zebrafish/ allas:2001659-genomes/zebrafish\n```\n\nAfter copying the files, we can use `rclone ls` to see what has been uploaded\nto Allas:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login11 genomes] rclone ls allas:2001659-genomes/zebrafish\n450646234 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.1.bt2\n334651392 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.2.bt2\n   187325 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.3.bt2\n334651387 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.4.bt2\n450646234 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.1.bt2\n334651392 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.2.bt2\n1362788082 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n      715 Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa.fai\n```\n\n### B. Downloading the data to Puhti\n\nNext, we download the same data to Puhti. After connecting to Puhti, we go to\nthe scratch directory of `project_2001659` and load the `allas` module:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2001659\nmodule load allas\n```\n\nIn this case, we want to use Allas with the project 2001659, so we can give the\nproject name as an argument for the `allas-conf` command:\n\n```bash\nallas-conf project_2001659\n```\n\nNow the configuration process asks only for the CSC password and then sets up\nthe connection to Allas for project 2001659. As the Puhti scratch directory is\nshared by all project members, we create a user-specific subdirectory\n`kkayttaj` and go there:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p kkayttaj\ncd kkayttaj/\n```\n\nWe can now use the command `rclone lsd` to check the available buckets in\nAllas:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ rclone lsd allas:\n  3268222761 2020-10-03 10:01:42         8 2001659-genomes\n  2576778428 2020-10-03 10:01:42         4 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH\n```\n\nNow we see two buckets. `2001659-genomes` is the one that was just created in\nthis example, while `2001659-mahti-SCRATCH` originates from the previous\na-command example. Next, we list the objects in the `2001659-genomes` bucket:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ rclone ls allas:2001659-genomes\n450646234 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.1.bt2\n334651392 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.2.bt2\n   187325 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.3.bt2\n334651387 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.4.bt2\n450646234 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.1.bt2\n334651392 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.rev.2.bt2\n1362788082 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n      715 zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa.fa\n```\n\nFinally, we use the `rclone copyto` command to copy the data from Allas to\nPuhti into a new directory `zebrafish2`: \n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ rclone -P copyto allas:2001659-genomes/zebrafish zebrafish2\nTransferred:        3.044 GiB / 3.044 GiB, 100%, 323.600 MBytes/s, ETA 0s\nTransferred:            8 / 8, 100%\nElapsed time:        9.6s\n\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ ls zebrafish2\nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.1.bt2      Danio_rerio.GRCz10.91.3.bt2  \nDanio_rerio.GRCz10.91.2\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
