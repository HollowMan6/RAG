Login nodes are shared by all users and are **not** to be used for\nheavy processing. [See our usage policy for details](../usage-policy.md). If\nyou need to run heavy computations interactively, you can use the `interactive`\npartitions on Puhti and Mahti.\n\nThe `interactive` partition offers fewer resources than other partitions, but\njobs submitted to it have a much higher priority in comparison, so they will\ntypically spend very little time queueing. The partition can be used for\nrunning [web interface applications](../webinterface/apps.md) and\n[batch jobs](getting-started.md), but the most convenient way to use it is via\nthe [`sinteractive` command](#the-sinteractive-command).\n\n## The `sinteractive` command\n\n`sinteractive` starts a new shell program on a compute node with the resources\nspecified by the user. Processes can be launched as if you were using your own\ndevice, i.e. it is not necessary or even possible to use Slurm commands like\n`srun`. The shell environment differs slightly from that of the login nodes,\ne.g. \"heavier\" text editors like Vim and Emacs are not available, so one must\nuse Vi or Nano instead.\n\nSince `sinteractive` starts a new shell, any environment variables that are\nnot set in the user's initialization files need to be defined again manually.\nOnce the interactive session is finished, you are returned to your original\nshell program, and all temporary data written to `$TMPDIR` and `$LOCAL_SCRATCH`\nduring the session are lost.\n\nWhile the recommended way to use graphical applications is the\n[virtual desktop](../webinterface/desktop.md), it is also possible to do this\nin an interactive session launched from the command line\n[using X11 forwarding](#starting-an-interactive-application-with-x11-graphics).\n\nThe easiest way to use `sinteractive` is running the command with the `-i`\noption:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive -i\n```\n\nWhen this option is used, the user is prompted for the individual parameters\nof the session (runtime, memory, cores, etc.). If you do not want to specify\nthe resources interactively, you can simply pass them to the command as\narguments. Note that the available options and resources are not identical on\nPuhti and Mahti due to differences in hardware.\n\n### `sinteractive` on Puhti\n\nOn Puhti, each user can have up to two active sessions on the `interactive`\npartition.\n\nIf your resource requests exceed the\n[limits of the Puhti `interactive` partition](./batch-job-partitions.md#puhti-interactive-partition),\nor if you already have two active sessions there, you are offered the option\nto submit the job to the `small` or `gpu` partitions instead. In this case,\nyour job does not benefit from the higher priority of the `interactive`\npartition, so you will need to wait some time before the requested resources\nbecome available and the interactive session starts. If you request GPUs using\nthe `-g` option, your job is automatically submitted to the `gpu` partition.\n\nAll sessions started with `sinteractive` are run on nodes that have\n[fast local NVMe storage](../disk.md#compute-nodes-with-local-ssd-nvme-disks)\navailable. This local disk area has high I/O\ncapacity and is therefore the ideal location for temporary files created by\nyour processes. Do keep in mind that this disk area is emptied when the\ninteractive session ends. The `$TMPDIR` and `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` environment\nvariables point to the local disk area of the job.\n\nTo see the command options available on Puhti, run the following while\nlogged into the system:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --help\n```\n\n### `sinteractive` on Mahti\n\nOn Mahti, each user can have up to 8 active sessions on the `interactive`\npartition. See the\n[Mahti `interactive` partition details](batch-job-partitions.md#mahti-interactive-partition)\nfor information on the available resources. It is also possible to request a\na [GPU slice](./batch-job-partitions.md#gpu-slices) for interactive work by\nusing the `-g` flag, which submits the job to the `gpusmall` partition. Note\nthat using a GPU slice restricts the amount of CPU cores and memory that is\navailable for your job.\n\nAs with Puhti, you can see the Mahti-specific command options by running the\nfollowing while logged into the system:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --help\n```\n\n### Example: Running a Jupyter notebook or RStudio server via `sinteractive`\n\nSee the tutorial on\n[using RStudio or Jupyter notebooks](../../support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks.md).\n\n### Example: Running an MPI job in an interactive session\n\nSince the shell that is started in the interactive session is already a job\nstep in Slurm, additional job steps cannot be created. This prevents running\ne.g. GROMACS tools in the usual way, since `gmx_mpi` is a parallel program and\nnormally requires using `srun`. In this case, `srun` must be replaced with\n`orterun -n 1` in the interactive shell. Orterun does not know of the Slurm\nflags, so it needs to be told how many tasks/threads to use. The following\nexample will run a [GROMACS](../../apps/gromacs.md) mean square displacement\nanalysis for an existing trajectory:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project>\nmodule load gromacs-env\norterun -n\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A supercomputer facility that provides login nodes for users, not intended for heavy processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A part of the CSC supercomputer infrastructure, offering interactive partitions for high-priority jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another part of the CSC supercomputer infrastructure, also offering interactive partitions for high-priority jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINTERACTIVE COMMAND<|>EVENT<|>A command that initiates a new shell program on a compute node, allowing for interactive processing without heavy Slurm commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL DESKTOP<|>EVENT<|>A recommended method for using graphical applications on CSC supercomputers, utilizing web interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>X11 FORWARDING<|>EVENT<|>A method to start interactive applications with graphical interfaces from the command line on CSC supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROMACS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software package for simulating molecular dynamics, mentioned in the context of running MPI jobs interactively)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>Puhti is a part of the CSC supercomputer infrastructure, providing specific services for interactive jobs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>Mahti is a part of the CSC supercomputer infrastructure, providing specific services for interactive jobs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINTERACTIVE COMMAND<|>PUHTI<|>The sinteractive command is used to start interactive sessions on Puhti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINTERACTIVE COMMAND<|>MAHTI<|>The sinteractive command is used to start interactive sessions on Mahti<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL DESKTOP<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>The virtual desktop is a recommended method for using graphical applications on CSC supercomputers<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>X11 FORWARDING<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>X11 forwarding allows for the use of graphical interfaces in interactive sessions on CSC supercomputers<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROMACS<|>SINTERACTIVE COMMAND<|>GROMACS tools require adjustments when run in an interactive session initiated by the sinteractive command<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
