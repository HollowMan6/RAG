If you need more\nGPUs, use the `gpumedium` queue. You can read more about [multi-GPU and\nmulti-node jobs in our separate tutorial](ml-multi.md).\n\nFor more detailed information about the different partitions, see our page about\n[the available batch job partitions on CSC's\nsupercomputers](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md) and [Slurm partitions on LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/partitions/).\n\n## GPU utilization\n\nGPUs are a very expensive resource compared to CPUs, hence, GPUs\nshould be maximally utilized once they have been allocated. We provide\nsome tools to monitor the utilization of GPU jobs on different\nsupercomputers. The GPU utilization, should ideally be close to\n100%. If your utilization is consistently low (for example under 50%)\nit might because of several reasons:\n\n- You may have have a processing bottle-neck, for example you should\n  use a data loading framework (and reserve enough CPU cores for it)\n  to be able to feed the GPU with data fast enough. [See our\n  documentation on using multiple CPU cores for data\n  loading](#using-multiple-cpus-for-data-pre-processing).\n  \n- Alternatively, it might simply be the case that the computational\n  problem is \"too small\" for the GPU, for example if the neural\n  network is relatively simple. This is not a problem as such, but if\n  your utilization is really low, you might consider if using CPUs\n  would be more cost efficient.\n\nAs always, don't hesitate to [contact our service desk](../contact.md)\nif you have any questions regarding GPU utilization.\n\n### Tools for monitoring GPU utilization\n\n#### `seff` command for a completed job (Puhti and Mahti)\n\nThe easiest way to check the GPU utilization on a completed job is to\nuse the `seff` command:\n\n```bash\nseff <job_id>\n```\n\nIn this example we can see that maximum utilization is 100%, but\naverage is 92% (this is a good level):\n\n```\nGPU load \n     Hostname        GPU Id      Mean (%)    stdDev (%)       Max (%) \n       r01g07             0         92.18         19.48           100 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGPU memory \n     Hostname        GPU Id    Mean (GiB)  stdDev (GiB)     Max (GiB) \n       r01g07             0         16.72          1.74         16.91 \n```\n\n#### `nvidia-smi` for a running job (Puhti and Mahti)\n\nWhen the job is running you can run `nvidia-smi` over `ssh` on the\nnode where it is running. You can check the node's hostname with the\n`squeue --me` command. The output can look something like this:\n\n```\n   JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n17273947       gpu puhti-gp mvsjober  R       0:07      1 r01g06\n```\n\nYou can see the node's hostname from the `NODELIST` column, in this\ncase it's `r01g06`. You can now check the GPU utilization with\n(replace `<nodename>` with the actual node's hostname in your case):\n\n```bash\nssh <nodename> nvidia-smi\n```\n\nThe output will look something like this:\n\n```\nWed Jun 14 09:53:11 2023\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| NVIDIA-SMI 515.105.01   Driver Version: 515.105.01   CUDA Version: 11.7     |\n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.
