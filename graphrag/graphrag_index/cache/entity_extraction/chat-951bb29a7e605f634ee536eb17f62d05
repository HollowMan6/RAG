Qiskit and Cirq scripts can only be submitted as ordinary python files.\nTo submit and run jobs on Helmi you need to use the correct environment on LUMI.\n\n* First, run `module use /appl/local/quantum/modulefiles`. The available modules will now show up on `module avail`.\n* Second, depending on if you want to use the Qiskit or Cirq environment, run:\n    * `module load helmi_qiskit` or\n    * `module load helmi_cirq`\n\n\n`helmi_qiskit` and `helmi_cirq` provide pre-made python environments to directly run on Helmi.\nIf you wish to add your own python packages to the pre-made python environment you can do so with `python -m pip install --user package`.\n\n\n!!! info \"Creating your own python environment\"\n    Users can create their own python environment if they wish. The only prerequisite is to load the `helmi_standard` module.\n    To create your own environment the [container wrapper tool](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/container-wrapper/) is recommended.\n\nThe current supported software versions on helmi are:\n\n| Software | Module_name | Versions |\n|----------|-------------|----------|\n| Cirq on IQM | cirq_iqm | >= 14.0, < 15.0 |\n| Qiskit on IQM | qiskit_iqm | >= 13.0, < 14.0 |\n| IQM client | iqm_client | >= 17.1, < 18.0 |\n| Cortex CLI | iqm_cortex_cli | >= 5.8, < 6.0 |\n\nHere is an example batch script to submit jobs on Helmi\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --job-name=helmijob   # Job name\n#SBATCH --account=project_<id>  # Project for billing (slurm_job_account)\n#SBATCH --partition=q_fiqci   # Partition (queue) name\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1              # One task (process)\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G       # memory allocation\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1     # Number of cores (threads)\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00         # Run time (hh:mm:ss)\n\nmodule use /appl/local/quantum/modulefiles\n\n# uncomment correct line:\n# module load helmi_qiskit\n# or\n# module load helmi_cirq\n\npython your_python_script.py\n```\n\nThe batch script can then be submitted with `sbatch`. You can also submit interactive jobs through `srun`.\n\n```bash\nsrun --account=project_<id> -t 00:15:00 -c 1 -n 1 --partition q_fiqci python your_python_script.py\n```\n\nThe `helmi_*` module sets up the correct python environment to use Qiskit or Cirq in conjunction with Helmi.\n\n!!! info \"Running on Helmi\"\n    When submitting a job on Helmi, the user's slurm_job_account (project on which the job is run) is mapped to the project_id and this information is transferred to VTT for accounting purposes.\n\n### Qiskit\n\nTo load the Qiskit module use `module load helmi_qiskit`.\n\nIn Qiskit python scripts you will need to include the following:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute\nfrom iqm.qiskit_iqm import IQMProvider\n\nHELMI_CORTEX_URL = os.getenv('HELMI_CORTEX_URL')  # This is set when loading the module\n\nprovider = IQMProvider(HELMI_CORTEX_URL)\nbackend = provider.get_backend()\n\nshots = 1000  # Set the number of shots you wish to run with\n\n# Create your quantum circuit.\n# Here is an example\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)\ncircuit.h(0)\ncircuit.cx(0, 1)\ncircuit.measure_all()\n\nprint(circuit.draw(output='text'))\n\njob = execute(circuit, backend, shots=shots)  # execute your quantum circuit\ncounts = job.result().get_counts()\nprint(counts)\n```\n\n### Cirq\n\nTo load the Cirq module use `module load helmi_cirq`.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nimport cirq\nfrom iqm.cirq_iqm import Adonis\nfrom iqm.cirq_iqm.iqm_sampler import IQMSampler\n\nadonis = Adonis()\n\nHELMI_CORTEX_URL = os.getenv('HELMI_CORTEX_URL')  # This is set when loading the module\n\nsampler = IQMSampler(HELMI_CORTEX_URL)\n\nshots = 1000\n\n# Create your quantum circuit\n# Here is an example\nq1, q2 = cirq.NamedQubit('QB1'), cirq.NamedQubit('QB2')\ncircuit = cirq.Circuit()\ncircuit.append(cirq.H(q1))\ncircuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q1, q2))\ncircuit.append(cirq.measure(q1, q2, key='m'))\nprint(circuit)\n\ndecomposed_circuit = adonis.decompose_circuit(circuit)\nrouted_circuit, initial_mapping, final_mapping = adonis.route_circuit(decomposed_circuit)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
