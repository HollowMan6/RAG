It is possible to execute parallel `foreach` loops on Puhti using the `doMPI` package. While otherwise the batch job file looks similar to that used for a multi-processor job, we could modify the `srun` command at the end of the batch job file:\n\n```bash\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save --slave myscript.R\n```\n\nThe `--slave` argument is optional and will prevent different processes from printing out a welcome message etc.\n\nUnlike when using `snow`, jobs using `doMPI` launch a number of R sessions equal to the number of reserved cores that all begin to execute the given R script. It is important to include the `startMPIcluster()` call near the beginning of the R script as anything before it will be executed by all available processes (while only the master process continues after it). Upon completion, the cluster is closed using `closeCluster()`. The `mpi.quit()` function can then be used to terminate the MPI execution environment and to quit R:\n\n```r\nlibrary(doMPI, quietly = TRUE)\ncl <- startMPIcluster()\nregisterDoMPI(cl)\n\nsystem.time(a <- foreach(i = 1:7) %dopar% system.time(sort(runif(1e7))))\na\n\ncloseCluster(cl)\nmpi.quit()\n```\n\n*Jobs using `snow`*\n\nWhereas most parallel R jobs employing the `r-env` module can be submitted using `srun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript`, those involving the package `snow` need to be executed using a separate command (`RMPISNOW`). `snow` relies on a communication model where a master process is used to control other processes (workers). Because of this, the batch job file must specify one more task than the planned number of `snow` workers, as the master needs its own task. For example, for a job requiring seven workers, we could submit a job as follows:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_snow\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=8\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n\n# Load r-env\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec RMPISNOW --no-save --slave -f myscript.R\n```\n\nUnlike when using `foreach` and `doMPI`, here only the master process runs the R script. The R script must contain the call `getMPIcluster()` that is used to produce a reference to the cluster which can then be passed onto other functions. Upon completion of the analysis, the cluster is stopped using `stopCluster()`. For example:\n\n```r\ncl <- getMPIcluster()\n\nfuntorun <- function(k) {\n  system.time(sort(runif(1e7)))\n}\n\nsystem.time(a <- clusterApply(cl, 1:7, funtorun))\na\n\nstopCluster(cl)\n```\n\n*Jobs using `future`*\n\nThe `future` package provides an API for R jobs using futures (see the [future CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html) for details). Whether futures are resolved sequentially or in parallel is specified using the function `plan()`.\n\nFor analyses requiring a single node, `plan(multisession)` and `plan(multicore)` are suitable. The former spawns multiple independent R processes and the latter forks an existing R process. Using `plan(cluster)` is suitable for work using multiple nodes.\n\nTo submit a job involving multisession or multicore futures, one should specify a single node (`--nodes=1`), a single task (`--ntasks=1`), and the number of cores (`--cpus-per-task=x`; 40 is the maximum on a single node). By default, the number of workers is the number of cores given by `availableCores()`. For guidelines on designing batch job files, see other examples on this page.\n\nThe R script below could be used to compare analysis times using sequential, multisession and multicore strategies. \n\n```r\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(tictoc)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\n# Different future plans (choose one) \n#\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A variable used in batch processing to identify specific array jobs within a larger array job setup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TMPDIR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A temporary directory path specified in the .Renviron file for storing intermediate job data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSCRIPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R programming language script file executed in parallel or batch processing environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER_WRAPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A wrapper used for executing commands within an Apptainer (formerly Singularity) container environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYLIST.TXT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A text file containing a list of inputs or parameters for batch processing in R)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSCRIPT.R<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R script file that contains the code to be executed in parallel or batch processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DO_MPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package that provides support for parallel execution of R code using MPI (Message Passing Interface))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOREACH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package that facilitates executing R code in parallel using a for-loop like syntax)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package that supports simple network of workstations for parallel computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package that provides a unified API for accessing results of future evaluations of R expressions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID<|>MYLIST.TXT<|>SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID is used to determine which lines from mylist.txt to process in a given array job<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TMPDIR<|>RSCRIPT<|>TMPDIR provides a directory path used by Rscript for storing temporary data during execution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINER_WRAPPER<|>RSCRIPT<|>Apptainer_wrapper is used to execute Rscript within a containerized environment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DO_MPI<|>FOREACH<|>doMPI is used as a backend for the foreach package to enable parallel execution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW<|>RSCRIPT<|>The snow package is used within Rscript to facilitate parallel computing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUTURE<|>RSCRIPT<|>The future package is used within Rscript to manage asynchronous computations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
