Under the hood, it uses the VTK library, in Python wrapping. We recommend the [HPC web interface remote desktops](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md) for interactive use.\n\n!!! info \"Running ParaView with GPU-accelerated graphics on Puhti and LUMI\"\n    You can now also enable [interactive visualization with GPU acceleration](../computing/webinterface/accelerated-visualization.md) for better\n    performance. In this case, select _Accelerated visualization_ instead of _Desktop_\n    in the Puhti web interface. On LUMI, select the _Desktop_ app and `lumid`\n    partition ([more information](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/desktop/)).\n\nParaView is designed to run parallel tasks and consists of one client and one or several servers (pvservers). There are many ways to run ParaView to suit different needs.\n\n## License\n\nParaView uses a [permissive BSD license](https://www.paraview.org/paraview-license/) that enables the broadest possible audience, including commercial organizations, to use the software, royalty free, for most purposes.\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 5.10.1\n* Mahti: 5.10.1\n* LUMI: 5.8.0\n\n## Usage\n\n### Standalone mode\n\nThe most straightforward way to use ParaView is to run it in standalone mode. This mode is sufficient for basic visualization tasks and is a good starting point also for more complex tasks.\n\nStandalone ParaView needs no pvserver reservation. **Note that ParaView should not be run on the login node**. You can use `sinteractive -i` command to reserve one CPU and up to 16 GB memory for your interactive session. When resources become available, the session is directed to a compute node. Load the module and start ParaView:\n\n```bash\nmodule purge\nmodule load paraview/5.10.1-paraview\nparaview\n```\n\nIf you need more resources, use `srun` and give session parameters as a one-liner. The following reserves 32 GB memory for one CPU, for one hour:\n\n```bash\nsrun --partition=small --time=01:00:00 --mem=32G --account=<project> --x11=first --pty bash\n```\n\nWhen directed to a compute node, load the module and start ParaView, as shown in the example above.\n\nIf your model has complex geometry, interaction becomes slow and lag in screen updates is noticeable. ParaView has a tick box option to use OSPRay renderer for faster screen re-draws. Note that switching between the default and OSPRay rendering modes can be slow. Even when using one CPU, OSPRay rendering is much faster.\n\nOSPRay is capable of using more than one CPU as threads to further accelerate screen updates. Threads are reserved with `--cpus-per-task`. The following example reserves 5 threads for rendering, and uses in total 32 GB of memory distributed between the CPUs. Note that most other functions of ParaView are not threaded, so they still use only one CPU.\n\n```bash\nsrun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=5 --partition=small --time=01:00:00 --mem=32G --account=<project> --x11=first --pty bash\n```\n\nAs previously shown, once directed to a compute node, load the module and start ParaView.  \n\n### Parallel mode - client using several servers (pvservers) and threads\n\nFor demanding jobs, ParaView can be run in parallel mode: one client and many pvservers, each running on separate CPUs. The client connects to one of the pvservers, which communicates with the rest of the pvservers.  \n\nNote that if most of the work is done by only one pvserver, using a parallel setup can actually make ParaView run slower, due to extra time taken to parse data from different CPUs. You can check how much each pvserver is being used by opening *Memory Inspector* window in ParaView (file menu: *View/Memory Inspector*). ParaView's *D3*-filter can be used to distribute work more evenly between the cores.  \n\nThe example script `para5101-multi.sh` below starts several pvservers and one client (front-end), and connects them. After copying the script, check that it has the necessary execute permission - use `chmod u+x` to grant it. The script needs no editing. Resources should be reserved via `salloc` command. Reservation is for the client and the pvservers combined. `--ntasks` is the number of pvservers plus one client, and `--cpus-per-task` is the number of threads for each of these tasks, so the number of CPUs reserved is `--ntasks` * `cpus-per-task`. `--mem` is the combined memory used by all. The script reserves one GB memory for the client, and the rest is divided between the pvservers.\n\nThe `salloc` example below allocates resources for one client and nine pvservers, each with two threads, so 20 CPUs are reserved. Nine GB memory in total is allocated for the pvservers, and one GB for the client. ParaView's OSPRay renderer uses threads, while most of the other ParaView functions benefit more of pvservers. **Note that all these `salloc` parameters need to be explicitly given,** otherwise the script `para581-multi.sh` will not work  \n\n```bash\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
