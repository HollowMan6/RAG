This means that all minor updates need to be installed by the user. You can either do this in SNAP Desktop by following the instructions in the pop-up at start up, or for SNAP 9 by running `source update_snap` after loading the SNAP module in the terminal.\n\n## License\n\nAll SNAP software is published under the [GPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) license.\n\n## Citation\n\n```SNAP - ESA Sentinel Application Platform v{VERSION}, http://step.esa.int```\n\n\n\n##  Acknowledgement\n\nPlease acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072531) and the Open Geospatial Information Infrastructure for Research (Geoportti, urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072513) for computational resources and support\".\n\n\n## Installation\n\nSNAP was installed to Puhti with Singularity using the [SNAP Docker image provided by mundialis on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mundialis/esa-snap) with some small additions to provide snappy and snapista Python interfaces.
