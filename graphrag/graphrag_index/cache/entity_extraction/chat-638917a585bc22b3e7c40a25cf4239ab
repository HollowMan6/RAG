A web interface for LUMI is also\navailable at [www.lumi.csc.fi](https://www.lumi.csc.fi), see the\n[LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/) for\nmore details.\n\n!!! warning \"Scope\"\n    The HPC web interfaces are best suited for **interactive workloads** that\n    consume a **modest amount of computational resources**. Some examples are\n    **pre- and post-processing of data** in Jupyter Notebooks using\n    **at most a few tens of CPU cores**, **small-scale AI/ML experiments**\n    using a **single GPU**, and **data visualization** tasks.\n\n    Please note that the interactive applications in the web interfaces are\n    **not** suitable for **multi-node** and **multi-GPU jobs**. Such workloads\n    should ideally be carried out as standard\n    [batch jobs](../running/getting-started.md). If you are new to batch jobs\n    and command-line usage of the HPC environment, we recommend the\n    [CSC Computing Environment](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/)\n    self-learning materials to learn how to get the most out of CSC's\n    supercomputers.\n\n## Available features\n\n- **Features available in both the Puhti and Mahti web interfaces:**\n    - View, download, upload and move files between Allas, the supercomputer\n      and your local computer\n    - Open a shell on the login node\n    - Open a persistent shell on a compute node\n    - View running batch jobs\n    - View disk quotas and project status\n    - Launch interactive apps and connect to them directly from the browser:\n        - Desktop with apps such as Maestro and VMD\n        - Julia-Jupyter\n        - Jupyter\n        - Jupyter for courses: An interactive Jupyter session specifically for\n          courses\n        - MLflow\n        - TensorBoard\n        - Visual Studio Code\n- **Apps available in Puhti only:**\n    - Accelerated visualization with applications:\n        - Blender\n        - COMSOL\n        - ParaView\n        - VMD\n    - RStudio\n    - MATLAB\n\n### Shell\n\nThe _Shell_ apps can be used to access the command-line of a supercomputer via\nthe web interface. You can either open a connection to the login nodes, or a\nmore persistent shell to the compute nodes. For more details, see the\n[Shell](shell.md) page.\n\n### File browser\n\nThe _Files_ app can be used to manage your files on the supercomputer and\naccess storage services such as Allas and IDA. For more information, check the\n[Files and storage services](file-browser.md) page.\n\n### Active jobs\n\nRecent and running batch jobs can be viewed using the _Jobs_ section in the top\nnavbar and selecting _Active jobs_. Here you can view the current status of\nyour jobs and what kind of resources were requested. Deleting a running job\nwill cancel the job. \n\nIn the future, it may become possible to submit batch jobs through the web\ninterface, but for now the recommended way to launch standard batch jobs is\nusing `sbatch` from the shell.\n\n### Project view\n\nUsing the _Project view_ under the _Tools_ section in the top navbar, you can\nview  current disk and project billing unit quotas on the supercomputers. For\nmore information, see the [Project view](project-view.md) page.\n\n### Interactive apps\n\n_Interactive apps_ are programs that can be launched and run on the compute\nnodes and provide a graphical user interface. These are apps such as Jupyter\nNotebook, RStudio and Visual Studio Code. For a full list of applications and\nspecific instructions, see the [Interactive apps](apps.md) page.\n\n!!! info-label\n    If an interactive app does not start, or does not work as expected, you can\n    delete the session and try to launch the app again. See also\n    [Troubleshooting](apps.md#troubleshooting).\n\n### Partitions and resources\n\n!!! warning-label\n    Only a few partitions of Puhti and Mahti are available for use in the web\n    interfaces. Some apps also have a more limited set of partitions available\n    than others.\n\nIn the **Puhti web interface**, the `interactive`, `small`, `test`, `gpu` and\n`gputest` partitions are available. Selecting the `gpu` or `gputest` partition\nwill allocate one Nvidia V100 GPU. See the\n[Puhti partitions page](../running/batch-job-partitions.md#puhti-partitions)\nfor general information about queues on Puhti.\n\nIn the **Mahti web interface**, the `interactive` and `gpusmall` partitions are\navailable. Selecting the `gpusmall` partition will allocate a split Nvidia A100\nGPU (a100_1g.5g) with 1/7th of the compute capacity of a full A100. For more\ndetails about the split GPUs on Mahti, see the\n[Mahti partitions page](../running/batch-job-partitions.md#mahti-partitions).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
