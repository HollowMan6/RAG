These software environments can be activated with the `module\nload` command. See the specific documentation pages listed above for more\ndetails.\n\nIf you find a module that has most of what you need, but a few packages are\nmissing, you can easily install them yourself (to your home directory) with the\n`pip install --user` command. See our [Python documentation for more information\non how to install packages\nyourself](../../apps/python.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).\n\nIf you have more complex software needs which are not easily covered by our\nexisting modules, it is always possible to [create your own Python\nenvironments](../../apps/python.md#creating-your-own-python-environments). If\nyou are unsure what to do, you can always [contact our service\ndesk](../contact.md).\n\n\n## Step 7: Create your first batch job script\n\nPuhti is a supercomputer cluster, which means that it's a collection of hundreds\nof computers. Instead of running programs directly, they are put in a queue and\na scheduling system (called \"Slurm\") decides when and where the program will\nrun.\n\nTo run a program in Slurm we need to define a batch job script. This is just a\ntext file with a set of Slurm options defining the resources we need for our\nprogram and the actual commands needed to run it. You can read more about\ndefining [batch job scripts in our separate documentation\npage](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md).\n\nIn the file `run-cifar10.sh` in our code directory, you can find an example\nbatch job script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=project_2001234\n#SBATCH --partition=gputest\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10\n#SBATCH --mem=32G\n#SBATCH --time=15\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1,nvme:10\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load pytorch\n\ntar xf /scratch/project_2001234/cifar-10-python.tar.gz -C $LOCAL_SCRATCH\n\nsrun python3 cifar10_cnn.py --data_path=$LOCAL_SCRATCH/cifar-10-batches-py\n```\n\nThis will run a job in the `gputest` partition, with 10 CPU cores, 32GB memory\nand one NVIDIA V100 GPU. The job's maximum run time is 15 minutes. In fact, 15\nminutes is the maximum run time that you can request in the `gputest` partition\nas it is meant for short testing runs only. Finally, the `nvme:10` text in the\n`gres` options requests 10GB of the fast local drive (called \"NVMe\").\n\nBelow the `#SBATCH` options, you can see the actual commands. Our script does\nthree things:\n\n1. Load the `pytorch` module (and first purges any other previously loaded\n   modules)\n2. Extract the CIFAR10 dataset from the archive found in the scratch drive to\n   the fast local drive. The path to the fast local drive can be found from the\n   `$LOCAL_SCRATCH` environment variable. The path to the scratch drive will\n   vary depending on your project name, so **you will have to edit the script to\n   set the correct path for your case.**\n3. Finally, it runs the actual Python script with the path to where the data is\n   stored given in the `--data_path` argument. Note that the data now resides on\n   the fast local drive.\n\n\n!!! note\n\n    You don't need to use the fast local NVMe drive like we do in this example,\n    but it is a good practice to do so as reading a large number of files from\n    the shared file system (such as scratch and projappl) can cause a poor\n    performance, and in extreme cases degrade the performance for all users.\n    [Read more about efficient file system usage in our Machine learning guide.](ml-data.md)\n\n\n## Step 8: Run your first test job\n\nTo run the script, that is pass it to the Slurm queue, run the command (from the\ncode directory):\n\n```bash\nsbatch run-cifar10.sh\n```\n\nIf submission was successful it should report something like:\n\n```\nSubmitted batch job 12345678\n```\n\nIf you're instead seeing some error message, take a look at our [page of common\nbatch job errors](../faq/why-does-my-batch-job-fail.md). If you cannot find a\nsolution there, don't hesitate to [contact our service desk](../contact.md).\n\nYou can check your running job, either from the terminal:\n\n```bash\nsqueue -l -u $USER\n```\n\nor via the *Jobs* → *Active Jobs* menu in the Puhti web interface.\n\n## Step 9: Check the output of the job\n\nOnce the job has finished, its output should appear in a file called something\nlike `slurm-12345678.out`, with the number being the batch job ID of your jobs\n(printed at submission time). You can view this file by clicking on it in the\nFiles browser or using for example `less` in the command line (press 'q' to quit\n`less`).\n\nOnce you're satisfied that the job runs as it should, you can run in the real\n`gpu` partition that allows for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer cluster consisting of hundreds of computers, utilizing a scheduling system called Slurm for running programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm is a scheduling system used on the Puhti supercomputer cluster to manage job queues and resource allocation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON DATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python Data is a general module on Puhti containing data analytics libraries such as numpy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Dask, JupyterLab)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PyTorch is a software environment available on Puhti, used for running the CIFAR10 dataset example)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIFAR10<|>EVENT<|>CIFAR10 dataset example run on Puhti supercomputer, utilizing PyTorch and demonstrating the use of batch job scripts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>SLURM<|>Puhti uses Slurm as its scheduling system to manage program execution<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON DATA<|>PUHTI<|>Python Data module is available on Puhti for data analytics<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>CIFAR10<|>CIFAR10 dataset example is run using the PyTorch module on Puhti<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
