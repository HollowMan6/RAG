In some cases it is even possible to publish the data with the processing and analyses code as an executable paper in order to prove that the scientific process is reproducible. In other words, executable papers are dynamic pieces of software that combine text, raw data, and the code used for the analysis, and that a reader can interact with. \n\n!!! note \"Learn more about reproducibility and executable research articles:\"\n    - [What is an executable paper?](https://sozmethode.hypotheses.org/1045)\n\n### Files and file formats\n\nAll digital information is structured data. A **file format** is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. An **open format** is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standardization organization, that **can be used and implemented by anyone**. In contrast to open formats, **closed formats** are considered trade secrets. For example, a good deal of commercial equipment or software produce data that can not be read or interpreted without other tools from the same provider. When organizing, storing and publishing research data it is important to create coherent, intelligible and transparent entities that are easy to access and reuse. This is possible with open formats that can be opened and used also with commonly used open tools. \n\n**Organizing your data**\n\n- Sort and classify your information\n    - For instance, don't mix different types of information in excel columns: it is usually easier to combine datasets than sort out ill structured data later\n- Think about granularity (file size) and metadata\n- Decide on formats, units, codes etc. and be consistent\n    - Use common file formats, preferably open\n    - You can find a list of recommended file formats on the website about digital preservation. If you use other formats you will need to think about adding the technical documentation of the file format.\n-  Write a code book, document. Read me files are often necessary.\n-  Think about intelligibility\n-  Be careful when rearranging, reformatting, sorting or copy-pasting data\n-  Avoid including temporary or hidden system files along with actual data files\n-  Have processes in place for checking the data quality and completeness\n-  Be clear about master copies and other copies\n-  Be careful and plan well for sensitive data and anonymization\n-  Think about security and access rights\n-  Plan and agree on which versions of a dataset will be archived and/or published\n-  Think about reproducibility and citing data\n\n**Files and folders: structuring and naming**\n\nIt is important to take some time to plan file and folder structures and naming.\n\n- Create and agree on a system for naming files and folders and be consequent\n- Try to organize files logically using folders and subfolders rather than including all files in a single folder\n    - Avoid very deep folder structures, since they can be difficult to handle\n- If your data is time-sensitive, and logically organized by time periods, it could be useful to organize files by time-specific folders, such as YYYY-MM-DD\n- Use meaningful, unique file and folder names\n- Keep file and folder names as short as possible but relevant. 25 characters are usually considered maximum.\n- Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format allows you to sort and search your files\n- Avoid using special characters such as % & / \\ : ; * . ? < > ^! \" () and Scandinavian letters\n- Use three digits (or 4 if you have a large number of files) i.e. 001, 002…….201, 202 (not 1, 2, 21).\n- Use underscores (_) instead of spaces\n- If using a personal name in the name give the surname first followed by the first name\n    - Though, be very careful with personal data when naming files and folders\n- Indicate version number by using 'V' or 'version' and number (and subversions with more digits if minor changes)\n\n!!! note \"Additional readings\"\n    - [The UK Data Service: Format your data](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/format)\n    - [RDMkit: Data Organisation](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_organisation.html#what-is-the-best-way-to-name-a-file)\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xkqkg1oiUOQ\" title=\"Manage well and get preserved – 6.
