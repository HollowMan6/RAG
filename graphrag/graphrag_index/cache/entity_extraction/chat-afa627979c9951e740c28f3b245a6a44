QIIME takes users from their\nraw sequencing output through initial analyses such as OTU picking, taxonomic assignment, and construction of\nphylogenetic trees from representative sequences of OTUs, and through downstream statistical analysis, visualization,\nand production of publication-quality graphics.\n\nIn 2017 a totally rewritten version QIIME2 was released. The development of the original QIIME version has stopped. QIIME2 is strongly suggested for most uses.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Available\n\n- QIIME1: Puhti: 1.9.1\n- QIIME2: Puhti: 2022.8, 2023.2, 2023.5, 2023.9-amplicon, 2023.9-shotgun, 2024.2-amplicon, 2024.2-shotgun\n\n## Usage\n\nTo load QIIME1 module on Puhti:\n\n```bash\nmodule load qiime1\n```\n\nTo use QIIME2, check available versions with:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider qiime2\n```\n\nLoad desired version with e.g.:\n\n```bash\nmodule load qiime2/2023.9-amplicon\n```\n\nAfter that you can start QIIME2 with command:\n\n```bash\nqiime\n```\n\n## Distributions\n\nLatest versions of QIIME2 come in different distributions: amplicon/shotgun/tiny.\nThese distributions vary on which plugins come with them. You can compare the\n[distributions](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/install/#distributions) on QIIME2\nhome pages.\n\nCSC provides installations for the amplicon and shotgn distributions.\n\n## Additional plugins\n\nCSC only maintains the basic distributions of QIIME2. If you need plugins not included in the basic distributions, you will need to install your own QIIME2 using the [Tykky tool](../computing/containers/tykky.md).\n\nFirst select the distribution (amplicon/shotgun/tiny) that best meets your needs.\n\nDownload the corresponding [environment file](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/install/native/).\n\nFor example for 2023.9 amplicon distribution:\n\n```bash\nwget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/amplicon/qiime2-amplicon-2023.9-py38-linux-conda.yml\n```\n\nCheck the installation instructions for the plugins you want to use.\n\nIf the additional plugins can be installed with Conda, you can simply add them to the end of the\nenvironment file.\n\nIf the plugins need additional installation steps, you can copy them to text file and use\n`conda-containerize update` command as described in the Tykky documentation.\n\nInstallation:\n\n```bash\nmodule purge\nmodule load tykky\nmkdir qiime\nconda-containerize new --mamba --prefix qiime qiime2-amplicon-2023.9-py38-linux-conda.yml\n```\n\nIf necessary, run:\n\n```bash\nconda-containerize update qiime --post-install plugins.txt\n```\n\n## Running\n\nNote that many QIIME tasks involve heavy computing. Thus, these tasks should be executed as\nbatch jobs.\n\nQIIME jobs can be very disk intensive, especially its handling of temporary files, so it is best to\nreserve fast local disk for them.\n\nFor interactive batch jobs, see [sinteractive](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) documentation.\n\nIn case of normal batch jobs, you must reserve NVMe disk area that will be used as $TMPDIR area.\n\nFor example, to reserve 100 GB of local disk space:\n\n```text\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:100\n```\n\nFor example, the batch job script below runs the denoising step of the\n[QIIME moving pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.7/tutorials/moving-pictures/#option-1-dada2 )\nas a batch job using eight cores.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=qiime_denoise\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --mem=16G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:100\n\n#set up qiime\nmodule load qiime2/2023.9-amplicon\n\n# run task. Don't use srun in submission as it resets TMPDIR\nqiime dada2 denoise-single \\\n  --i-demultiplexed-seqs demux.qza \\\n  --p-trim-left 0 \\\n  --p-trunc-len 120 \\\n  --o-representative-sequences rep-seqs-dada2.qza \\\n  --o-table table-dada2.qza \\\n  --o-denoising-stats stats-dada2.qza \\\n  --p-n-threads $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n```\n\nMaximum running time is set to 1 hour (`--time=01:00:00`).
