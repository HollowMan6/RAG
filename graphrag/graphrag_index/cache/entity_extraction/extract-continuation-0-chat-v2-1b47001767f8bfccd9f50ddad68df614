This means that each of the VMs will be able to read and write to the same block device. This is similar to what a SAN will allow you to achieve.\n\n![Multi attach](../img/multi-attach.drawio.svg)\n\nThis feature has several advantages and disadvantages. On one hand it allows to share files among VMs without any kind of intermediary server that you will need with solutions like `NFS` or `GlusterFS`. This reduces the number of VMs needed, thus less maintenance and less single points of failure. On the other hand, it is necessary to run what is called a [clustered file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_file_system#SHARED-DISK) like [Oracle Cluster File System 2 (ocfs2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCFS2), or Red Hat [Global File System (GFS2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFS2). These systems need a cluster of connected daemons that will coordinate the read and write operations of the files. Other file systems like **ext4** or **xfs** do not support this use case and their use might lead to read errors or even data corruption, their use is unadvised. Each VM runs a copy of the daemon and there is no master, but a quorum based system. The choice between the two file systems depends on the use case and preferences based on vendors. In our tests GFS2 seems to be more suitable to Redhat based systems and OCFS2 to Debian ones, but your mileage might vary.\n\n!!! Warning\n    The configuration, maintenance and operations of these file systems are **not a trivial task**. The guides below are as a **starting point** and do not cover all possibilities, for more comprehensive information, please check the upstream documentation.\n\n## Create and attach a volume\n\n!!! Info \"quota\"\n    Make sure that you have available quota for this kind of Volume\n\n### WebUI\n\n1. Go to the [Volume page](https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/volumes/) of Pouta.\n\n1. Click in \"+Create Volume\"\n\n1. Create a volume as you would do for any other **Type** of volume. Set the **Volume Name** and **Size (GiB)** as desired.\n\n1. Change the **Type** to `standard.multiattach`.\n\n1. Click in \"Create Volume\".\n\n![Create Volume Multiattach](../img/create-volume-multiattach.png)\n\n!!! Warning \"not supported\"\n    You cannot attach a volume to multiple VMs from the WebUI, only see its status. You can only attach a volume to multiple VMs using the CLI.\n\n### CLI\n\nBefore doing this, you need to [install the openstack client](../install-client/):\n\n1. Create a multi attach volume:\n\n    ```sh\n    openstack volume create --size <size_in_GB> --type standard.multiattach <volume_name>\n    ```\n    You need to replace `<volume_name>` by the name you want to give to the volume, and the `<size_in_GB>` by the size in Gigabytes you want the volume to have.\n\n1. Attach the volume to a VM node:\n\n    ```sh\n    openstack --os-compute-api-version 2.60 server add volume \"<VM_name>\" <volume_name>\n    ```\n    You need to replace the `<volume_name>` by the name of the volume you created in the previous step, and the `<VM_name>` by the name of the VM node. When doing this for a cluster of VMs, you need to run the command once per VM.\n\n## GFS2 as an example\n\nThe Global file system or (GFS2 in short) is a file system currently developed by Red Hat. It uses [dlm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_lock_manager) to coordinate file system operations among the nodes in the cluster. The actual data is read and written directly to the shared block device.\n\n!!! Warning\n    GFS2 supports up to 16 nodes connected to the same volume. \n\n![GFS2 with DLM](../img/GFS2.drawio.svg)\n\n### GFS2 ansible install\n\nWe have written a small ansible [cinder-multiattach](https://github.com/lvarin/cinder-multiattach/) playbook, that installs a cluster of nodes and installs a shared GFS2 file system on them. The playbook is intended as a guide and demo, it is not production ready. For example, there is a manual step, attach the volume in each node. The Ansible playbook will create a cluster of VMs and install the requested file system on them. The end result will be the same volume mounted in every VM. The quick start commands are these:  \n\n```sh\n$> source ~/Downloads/project_XXXXXXX-openrc.sh\nPlease enter your OpenStack Password for project project_XXXXXXX as user YYYYYYYY: \n\n$> ansible-playbook main.yml -e fs='gfs2' -e csc_username='johndoe' -e csc_password='easyaccess'\n\n$> for i in $(seq 1 16);\ndo\n    openstack --os-compute-api-version 2.60 server add volume \"cinder-gfs2-$i\" multi-attach-test-gfs2\ndone\n\n$> ansible-playbook main.yml -e fs='gfs2'\n```\n\n*`csc_username` and `csc_password` can also be added in the `all.yaml`* file.  \n*It can\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC.fi provides IT support and resources for Finnish research institutions, including services like multi-attach Cinder volumes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINDER VOLUME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A block storage service provided by OpenStack that allows attaching a single volume to multiple VMs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pouta<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud service provided by CSC.fi for Finnish research and educational institutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open source cloud computing platform for public and private clouds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GFS2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A clustered file system developed by Red Hat that allows multiple nodes to share a common block device in a coordinated manner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED HAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software company that develops open-source software products for enterprises, known for its Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDER VOLUME<|>CSC.FI<|>CSC.fi supports the use of Cinder volumes through its Pouta cloud service<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Pouta<|>CSC.FI<|>Pouta is a cloud service provided by CSC.fi<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GFS2<|>RED HAT<|>GFS2 is developed by Red Hat and is suitable for Red Hat based systems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDER VOLUME<|>OPENSTACK<|>Cinder is a block storage service provided by OpenStack<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDER VOLUME<|>GFS2<|>GFS2 can be used as a file system for Cinder volumes in a multi-attach setup<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
