Adding extra software is possible, but it requires that \nyou convert the installation processes into files that can be uploaded to SD Connect and from there \ncopied to your SD Desktop environment for installation and usage.\n\nIn general, we recommend using Apptainer containers for importing the software you need.\n\nTo make additional software installations easier, CSC has created a **SD Software Installer** tool,\nthat provides an easy way to add few commonly used software packages and help tools to your virtual desktop. \nThis document describes the usage of this tool.\n\n<iframe width=\"512\" height=\"288\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S4hpjPy-TDQ\" title=\"How to install software on SD Desktop\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to get access to the installation tool, you need to **[send a request to CSC Service Desk](../../../support/contact.md)**.\nIn the request, indicate that you wish that the SD software installer would be \nmade available for your project. You must include the **Project identifier string** of your project to the request.\nYou can check this 32 characters long random string for example in the [SD Connect service](https://sd-connect.csc.fi). \nThere you find the Project Identifier in the **User information** view. \n\n## Installing the SD Software Installer\n\nLog in to your SD Desktop and open **Data Gateway**. If the software installation help tools are enabled for your project,\nthen you should have folder `tools-for-sd-desktop` included in the directory that Data Gateway created \n(in `Projects/SD-Connect/your-project-name`).\n\nOpen `tools-for-sd-desktop` folder and from there, drag/copy file `sd-installer-centos7.desktop` or `sd-installer-ubuntu22.desktop` to your desktop.\nSelect the version that matches the operating system of your SD Desktop.\n\n[![Installing-sd-installer](../images/desktop/sd-installer1.png)](../images/desktop/sd-installer1.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** Copying `sd-installer.desktop` file to SD desktop.\n \nDouble-click the copy of the installer tool in your desktop to start the software installation tool. In Ubuntu based virtual desktops you\nneed to right-click the and select _Allow Launching_ before you can use the installer.\n\n[![sd-installer](../images/desktop/sd-installer2.png)](../images/desktop/sd-installer2.png)\n\n**Figure 2.** SD Software installer\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to use the installer, you must have an active Data Gateway connection running and \nmounting of the SD Connect data should be done through the default location in the file system \n(_Projects_ directory in the users home directory). \n\nThe installer shows a panel of buttons that allow you to install a software by just clicking the button.\nThe available software include graphical and command line applications. For graphical applications, a launching icon is added \nto the desktop. All software is installed to directory `/shared-directory/sd-tools/` where the installation is available for all the\nusers of the virtual desktop.\n\nIn case of some applications, part of the installation process occurs only when the application is started for the first time.\nThus, you should start the application once after the installation, to make sure that the process is completed. After that\nthe installed software should work also when Data Gateway connection has not been opened.\n\n\n## Tool selection\n\nNotes about the available tools.
