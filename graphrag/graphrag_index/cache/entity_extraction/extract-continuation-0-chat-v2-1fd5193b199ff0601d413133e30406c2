This is due to performance issues of\n    Conda-based environments on shared file systems, causing long start-up delays\n    and system-wide slowdowns when running Python scripts.\n\nConda environments typically contain tens or even hundreds of thousands of\nfiles, and starting a Conda application requires reading a large number of them.\nUnfortunately, all parallel file systems, which are optimized for a large number of\nclients, have a poor single-client performance. You will notice this as longer\ninitial start up times for Conda applications and extra stress on the Lustre\nmetadata server.\n\n**Conda can still be used indirectly**. As an alternative to direct Conda usage,\nwe recommend:\n\n1. **Use CSC's pre-installed environments available through the module system**\n\n    Check if any of\n    [CSC's pre-installed environments](../../apps/python.md#pre-installed-python-environments)\n    would be suitable for your project. If the existing environment is missing a few\n    critical packages, you can often install the missing packages on your own.\n\n    Our [Python usage guide](python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules)\n    and [R application page](../../apps/r-env.md#r-package-installations) contain further\n    details on how to install your own packages on top of our modules. You can also\n    [contact CSC Service Desk](../contact.md) with requests for missing packages.\n\n2. **Create a containerized Conda or pip environment using CSC's Tykky tool**\n\n    CSC has developed\n    [a tool for wrapping Conda or pip installations](../../computing/containers/tykky.md)\n    into a smaller set of files using Apptainer and SquashFS technologies. The tool is\n    available as a pre-installed module and is also used for CSC's own installations.\n\n3. **Use your own custom containers**\n\n    This is a great alternative for developing software locally on a workstation,\n    and then deploying it on another workstation, cluster, or on cloud platforms.\n    CSC's supercomputers support Apptainer containers, which are are just single\n    large files for Lustre, thus avoiding much of the problems. Many software\n    projects offer Docker containers which can often be easily converted into\n    Apptainer format. Inside the container you can naturally use for example\n    Conda to manage the packages without causing any file system issues.\n\n    Use [Tykky](../../computing/containers/tykky.md) to convert an existing Docker\n    container to Apptainer or read our documentation on\n    [how to create your own Apptainer container](../../computing/containers/creating.md).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC supercomputers have deprecated the use of Conda environments installed directly on the parallel file system due to performance issues)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Conda is a management system for environments and packages that has faced performance issues on CSC supercomputers' parallel file systems)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lustre is a type of metadata server mentioned in the context of experiencing extra stress due to Conda environments on CSC supercomputers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tykky is a tool developed by CSC for wrapping Conda or pip installations into a smaller set of files using Apptainer and SquashFS technologies)##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apptainer is a container technology supported by CSC supercomputers for deploying software without causing file system issues)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>CONDA<|>CSC supercomputers have deprecated the direct installation of Conda environments due to performance issues<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>LUSTRE<|>CSC supercomputers' performance issues with Conda environments cause extra stress on Lustre metadata servers<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>TYKKY<|>CSC developed Tykky as a solution for managing Conda or pip environments more efficiently on their supercomputers<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>APPTAINER<|>CSC supports the use of Apptainer containers as an alternative to direct Conda usage on their supercomputers<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYKKY<|>APPTAINER<|>Tykky is used to wrap installations into Apptainer containers for better performance on CSC supercomputers<|>9)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
