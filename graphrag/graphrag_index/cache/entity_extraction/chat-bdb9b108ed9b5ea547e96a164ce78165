You can check this in the `Pods` page (**Project > Pods** in the Developer page).\n\n![Pods](../img/podsAutoscaler.png)\n\n!!! info \"Using the CLI\"\n\n    You can use the command line interface to get the current status of the autoscaler:\n    ```\n    $ oc get HorizontalPodAutoscaler example   \n    NAME      REFERENCE            TARGETS          MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE\n    example   Deployment/example   9%/50%, 0%/50%   1         4         1          1h\n    ```\n\nThere is only need for a single Pod because only ~100MB is used out of 1Gi of total memory. This is less than the 50% of memory we configured. We will now artificially raise the memory usage. We will enter in a terminal of the single Pod that is running (Click in the Pod name and then in the \"Terminal\" tab), and run the following command:\n\n```sh\n/app/app.py 5 100\n```\n\nThis will create a new process that will reserve 5 chunks of 100MB of RAM. As 100+500 MB is more than 50% of the total 1Gi of memory, a new Pod will be created by the auto scaler. \n\n![2 Pods](../img/pods2Autoscaler.png)\n\nMonitor the situation and wait for the second Pod to be created. The resources can be monitored from the main project page, this gives a general view of the whole project, including the quota usage. Alternatively you can enter in the page of the deployment we created (from the **Project** page, go to **Deployment**, click in **example**, and finally in the Metrics tab. \n\nAfterwards, you can kill the process you created and see how the application is scaled down by killing the second Pod.\n\n!!! Info \"Scale down delay\"\n    Meanwhile the scale up is designed to be as fast as possible, the scale down will take up to 10 minutes. This is due to the stabilization window, from the [upstream kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#stabilization-wind):\n\n    > The stabilization window is used to restrict the flapping of replica count when the metrics used for scaling keep fluctuating. The autoscaling algorithm uses this window to infer a previous desired state and avoid unwanted changes to workload scale.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
