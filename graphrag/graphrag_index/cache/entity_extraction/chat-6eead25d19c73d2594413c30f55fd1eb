Download the extension `.vsix` from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools).\nSelect the *Linux x64* version.\n2. Upload `ms-vscode.cpptools-1.x.x@linux-x64.vsix` to Puhti or Mahti, for example using the file browser in the web interface.\n3. In the extensions tab in VS Code, click the three dots at the top to open a menu.\n4. Click *Install from VSIX...*  \n![](../../img/ood-vscode-install-cpptools.png).\n5. Navigate to the directory where you uploaded the `.vsix` file and select the file.\n\nThe compiler used can be selected when launching the interactive app.\n\nChanging compiler between the Intel compiler and gcc in the workspace may cause issues.\nMost of the problems can be solved by removing the launch and build configurations and creating them again.\n\n## Julia Language\nWe can use the [**Julia Language**](../../apps/julia.md) by loading a Julia module, such as `julia/1.8.5`, when starting the VSCode session.\nCSC has installed the [Julia for Visual Studio Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) extension to support Julia language features.\n\n## Troubleshooting\nIf VSCode does not work properly you can clear the settings and launch the application again.\nThis can be done done by deleting the folder `~/.local/share/csc-vscode`.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
