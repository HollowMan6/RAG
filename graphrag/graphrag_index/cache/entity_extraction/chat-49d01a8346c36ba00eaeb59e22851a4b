The emphasis in the program is on highly accurate computations, with extensive treatment of the electron correlation problem through the multireference configuration interaction, coupled cluster and associated methods.\n\n## Available\n\n-   Puhti: 2024.1\n\n## License\n\n-  The use of the software is restricted to non-commercial research. \n\n## Usage\n\nInitialise MOLPRO on Puhti:\n\n```bash\nmodule load molpro/2024.1\n```\n\nMolpro has been built with the Global Arrays toolkit (`--with-mpi-pr`) that allocates one helper process per node for parallel MPI runs.\n\n### Example batch script for Puhti using MPI parallelization\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40 # MPI tasks per node\n#SBATCH --account=<project>  # insert here the project to be billed \n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00           # time as `hh:mm:ss`\n\nmodule load molpro/2024.1\n\nexport MOLPRO_TMP=$PWD/MOLPRO_TMP_$SLURM_JOB_ID\nmkdir -p $MOLPRO_TMP\n\n$MOLPROP -d$MOLPRO_TMP -I$MOLPRO_TMP -W$PWD test.com\nrm -rf $MOLPRO_TMP\n```\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    Particularly some of the wavefunction-based electron correlation methods can be very disk I/O intensive. Such jobs benefit from using the [fast local storage](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/#local-storage) on Puhti. Using local disk for such jobs will also reduce the load on the Lustre parallel file system.\n\n### Example batch script for Puhti using MPI parallelization and local disk (NVMe)\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40 # MPI tasks per node\n#SBATCH --account=<project>  # insert here the project to be billed \n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00      # time as `hh:mm:ss`\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:100      # requested local disk space in GB \n\nmodule load molpro/2024.1\nexport MOLPRO_TMP=$LOCAL_SCRATCH/$SLURM_JOB_ID\nmkdir -p $MOLPRO_TMP\n\n$MOLPROP -d$MOLPRO_TMP -I$MOLPRO_TMP -W$PWD test.com\nrm -rf $MOLPRO_TMP\n```\n\n### Example of scalability\n\nThe performance of Molpro depends a lot on the system size and which computational model is used. The following table shows the wall time used (in seconds) for a single-point energy calculation on benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level, as function of the number of cores. The table shows also the corresponding timings when the local disk (NVMe) is used. Note that the parallel runs allocate one core per node for a helper process, hence there is one core less per node used for the actual calculation. \n\n\n| Cores               |Wall time/Lustre (s) | Wall time/NVMe (s) |\n| ------------------: | ------------------: | -----------------: |\n|  1                  | 11749               |   10962            |\n|  5                  |  3254               |    3228            |\n| 10                  |  1730               |    1561            |\n| 20                  |  1394               |    1239            |\n| 40                  |  1112               |     814            |\n| 2x20                |   786               |     729            |\n| 2x40                |   716               |     701            |    \n\n\n## References\n\nAll publications resulting from use of MOLPRO must acknowledge the following three references.\n\n1.
