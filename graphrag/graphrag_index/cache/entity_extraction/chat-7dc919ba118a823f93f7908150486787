It includes tools for all common satellite platforms.\n\n## Available\n\n__SNAP__ is available in Puhti with following versions:\n\n* 9.0 (wrapped singularity container with Python 3.6.9 including snappy and snapista)\n* 8.0 (Singularity container with snappy 8.0.3 and Python 3.6.9)\n\nIn addition we provide the module `snap/jupyter` which has SNAP 9.0 (wrapped singularity container with Python 3.6.9 including snappy and snapista) and jupyter installed. You can for example use it in the Jupyter application in the Puhti webinterface via the **custom module** option.\n\n### Installed toolboxes\n\n* Sentinel toolboxes (1,2,3) \n* SMOS toolbox \n* Radarsat toolbox \n* PROBA-V toolbox\n\nYou can install more plugins to your own user directory from the SNAP Graphical user interface.\n\n## Usage\n\nSNAP is included in the __snap__ module and can be loaded with:\n\n`module load snap`\n\nThis loads the newest available version. You can load an older version with:\n\n`module load snap/<VERSION>`\n\n### Using SNAP with Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Puhti web interface\n\nThe easiest option for using SNAP is to open it in Puhti web interface.\n\n1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi).\n2. Open [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). \n3. After launching the Desktop, double-click SNAP icon OR open `Terminal` (Desktop icon) and start SNAP:\n\n```\nmodule load snap\nsource snap_add_userdir $TMPDIR\nsnap -J-xmx10G\n```\n\n#### SNAP userdir and Java temp dir configuration \n\nSNAP uses significant amount of storage space for cache and temporary files. By default these are written to your HOME directory and may easily fill your HOME. For avoiding that configure your [snap user directory](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/15269950/SNAP+Configuration) and Java temporary folder. You should run this script every time you start using SNAP in Puhti or want to change the used folders. \n\nAfter loading the snap module run\n\n`source snap_add_userdir <YOUR-PROJECTS-SCRATCH-FOLDER>`\n\nYou could also request a fast [nvme](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#local-storage) disk in a batch job and run the command first in the batch job so that all the temp/cache files are written to a fast disk rather than the scratch. It might provide speed improvement in demanding calculations.\n\n`source snap_add_userdir $LOCAL_SCRATCH` with batch jobs\n\n`source snap_add_userdir $TMPDIR` with interactive jobs\n\nThis scripts sets also Java temporary folder, it is set to be snap/temp subfolder in the folder you defined. If you want to set Java temporary folder to be somewhere else use:\n`export _JAVA_OPTIONS=\"$_JAVA_OPTIONS -Djava.io.tmpdir=<SOME-FOLDER>\"` after setting the user directory.\n\n!!! note\n        The graphical user interface does not follow snap.userdir setting, but it notices the Java setting. Using SNAP GUI will create a __.snap__ folder inside your HOME directory and fill it. Empty it if you run out of space in your HOME directory.\n\n#### Java memory settings\n\n__By default SNAP/8.0 in Puhti uses only up to 2 Gb memory for Java.__ To increase this, add `-J-xmx10G` or similar setting to `snap` or `gpt` command. `-J-xmx10G` extends the Java maximum memory to 10Gb. Adjust this according to your needs and job memory reservation. Compared to your job memory reservation use for Java a few Gb less.\n\n### Using SNAP with Graph Processing Tool (gpt) command\n\nThe Graph Processing Tool `gpt` is a command line tool used for bulk processing. Using GPT more computing power can be used than with SNAP graphical interface, because it can be used in scripts and therefore included in jobs that can be submitted to any [Puhti partition](../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md).\n\nGPT command looks often something like this:\n\n```\ngpt -J-xmx10G <full_path_to_graph_xml_file> -Pfile=<inputfile> -t <outputfile>\n```\n\nSome relevant __gpt__ options include:\n\n* __-J-xmx10G__    maximum memory used by Java.\n* __-q__    Number of threads the gpt instance will use. Set it to the number of CPU cores requested or more\n* __-c__    Cache size in bytes. Change this if storage space becomes an issue\n* __-x__    Clear internal tile cache after writing a complete row of tiles to output file. Add this if memory becomes an issue\n\n\nSee the links under references at the end of this page for additional info about GPT.\n\nAlso the following command is very useful in creating the graphs for different operators. It can be executed in an interactive session\n```\nsinteractive -i\nmodule load snap\ngpt <snap-operator> -h\n```\n\n`gpt --diag -J-Xmx60G -c 40G` can be used to see which memory and cache settings are used by `gpt`.\n\n#### GPT examples for Puhti\n\n* [Full examples how to run GPT in Puhti\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
