The analysis\nidentifies potential performance bottlenecks - in particular those\nconcerning communication and synchronization - and offers guidance in\nexploring their causes. Scalasca supports applications using MPI,\nOpenMP, POSIX threads, or MPI+OpenMP/Pthreads parallelization.\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2.6\n* Mahti: 2.6\n\n## License\n\nUsage is possible for both academic and commercial purposes.\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing Scalasca involves three steps:\n\n1. Instrumentation\n2. Execution measurement collection & analysis\n3. Analysis report examination\n\n### Instrumentation\n\nScalasca uses\n[the Score-P measurement infrastructure](https://perftools.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de/cicd/scorep/tags/scorep-7.1/html/)\nfor instrumentation of the target application. Score-P can be used\nalso as a stand-alone tool without Scalasca.\n\nIn order to instrument an application, you need to recompile the\napplication using the Score-P instrumentation command `scorep`, which is added\nas a prefix to the original compile and link commands:\n\n```bash\nmodule load scorep\nscorep mpicc -o my_prog my_prog.c\n```\n\nor setting in a Makefile for C/C++ codes:\n\n```\nCC=scorep mpicc\n```\n\nor, similarly, for Fortran codes:\n\n```\nF90=scorep mpif90\n```\n\n### Measurement collection and analysis\n\nWhile applications instrumented by Score-P can be executed directly\nwith a measurement configuration defined via environment variables,\nthe `scan` convenience command provided by\nScalasca can be used to control certain aspects of the Score-P\nmeasurement environment during the execution of the target\napplication. To produce a performance measurement using an\ninstrumented executable, prefix `srun`\nwith the `scan` command in the batch job script:\n\n```bash\n...\n#SBATCH --ntasks=40\n\nmodule load scalasca\nscan srun ./my_app\n```\n\nBy default, a flat profile is collected. Upon completion, measurement\nresults are stored in the experiment directory, which by default is\ncomposed of the prefix `scorep_`, the target application executable\nname, the run configuration (e.g., number of MPI ranks and/or OpenMP\nthreads), and a few other parameters of the measurement\nconfiguration. For example, in the above example\n`scorep_my_app_40_sum`.\n\nOne can also collect event trace data. As tracing can produce huge\namounts of data, it is recommended to first estimate the size of\ntrace, and possibly filter out some functions from the measurement.\nEstimate can be obtained with `scorep-score` command:\n\n```text\n$ scorep-score -r scorep_my_app_40_sum/profile.cubex\n\nEstimated aggregate size of event trace:                   1022kB\nEstimated requirements for largest trace buffer (max_buf): 129kB\nEstimated memory requirements (SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY):       4097kB\n(hint: When tracing set SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY=4097kB to avoid intermediate flushes\n or reduce requirements using USR regions filters.)\n\nflt     type max_buf[B] visits time[s] time[%] time/visit[us]  region\n         ALL    131,431 20,196   12.81   100.0         634.28  ALL\n         MPI     95,054  8,076    8.65    67.5        1071.04  MPI\n         USR     24,168  8,056    3.38    26.3         418.96  USR\n         COM     12,168  4,056    0.78     6.1         193.47  COM\n      SCOREP         41      8    0.00     0.0          48.00  SCOREP\n\n         MPI     94,000  8,000    0.17     1.3          20.97  MPI_Sendrecv\n         USR     12,000  4,000    0.00     0.0           0.25  swap_fields\n         COM     12,000  4,000    0.00     0.0           0.53  exchange\n         USR     12,000  4,000    3.33    26.0         832.89  evolve\n         MPI        826     14    0.01     0.1         823.21  MPI_Recv\n...\n```\n\nIn order to filter out the measurement of `swap_fields` and `evolve`,\none can create a file `scorep.filter` with the contents:\n\n```text\nSCOREP_REGION_NAMES_BEGIN\n EXCLUDE\n   swap_fields\n   evolve\nSCOREP_REGION_NAMES_END\n```\n\nand check the effect of filtering with `-f` option:\n\n```bash\n$ scorep-score -f scorep.filter -r scorep_my_app_40_sum/profile.cubex\n\nEstimated aggregate size of event trace:                   835kB\nEstimated requirements for largest trace buffer (max_buf): 105kB\n...\n```\n\nOne could now proceed with the trace collection by setting\n`SCOREP_FILTERING_FILE` environment variable and by passing options\n`-q` and `-t` to `scan` command:\n\n```bash\n...\n#SBATCH --ntasks=40\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
