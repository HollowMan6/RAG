A fix to detect these nodes (to restart/clean them) is on its way, but meanwhile one can use a workaround to specify the memory required per node to something that should be available. Use e.g. `--mem=225G` in your slurm script.\n\n## Job crashes because of a faulty node\n\n_When you run into an issue that a job crash on LUMI could have caused by a faulty node, please remember first to question your code and the libraries that it uses.\n Out-of-memory messages do not always result from a system error. Also, note that segmentation violations are usually application or library errors that will not be solved by rebooting a node.\n\nIf you suspect that the job has crashed because of a faulty node:\n\n- Check whether the node health check procedure has caught the crash and drained the node with the command:\n  ```\n  sinfo -R --nodes=$(sacct -n -j <jobid> --format=nodelist --json | jq -r \".jobs[0].steps[1].nodes.list | .[]\" | paste -sd ',')\n  ```\n  Example:\n  ```\n  sinfo -R --nodes=$(sacct -n -j 123456 --format=nodelist --json | jq -r \".jobs[0].steps[1].nodes.list | .[]\"  | paste -sd ',')\n  ```\n\n- Send a ticket to [LUMI service desk](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/running/) identifying the job id, the error you got, and any other information you could provide to help find the source of the fault.\n\n- If you want to re-run a job and have a list of nodes to exclude, check the health status of these nodes to see if you could include them again, rather than having an ever-increasing list of nodes to exclude.\n  The command to check health of the nodes on your exclude list is:\n  ```\n  sinfo -R --nodes=<list_of_nodes>\n  ```\n  Example:\n  ```\n  sinfo -R --nodes=nid[005038,005270]\n  ```\n  Another example:\n  ```\n  sinfo -R --nodes=nid005038,nid005270\n  ```\n\n- You might also want to check if a node has been booted since the last time it gave an error. Command to do this is:\n  ```\n  scontrol show node <list_of_nodes> | grep \"NodeName\\|BootTime\" | awk '{print $1}'\n  ```\n\n- Also, note that all errors are not due to problems with nodes as such, but might have to do with network issues.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
