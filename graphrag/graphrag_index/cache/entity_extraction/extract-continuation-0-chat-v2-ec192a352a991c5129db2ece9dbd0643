This data can then later be processed as needed.\n\nFor example, several data collectors may push data to be processed, e.g. scientific instruments, meters, or software that harvests social media streams for scientific analysis. They can push their data into the object storage, and later virtual machines and computing jobs on Puhti can process the data.\n \n## Self-service backups of data\n\nThe object storage is also often used as a location for storing backups. It is a convenient place to push copies of database dumps.\n\n[allas-backup](./a_backup.md) is a part of *a-commands*. It works as a tool for creating backup copies of files in Allas.\n!!! note \n    Allas-backup is not a real backup service.\n    It only copies the data to another bucket in Allas which can \n    be easily removed or overwrited by any authenticated user.\n\n## Files larger than 5 GB\n\nFiles larger than 5 GB are divided into smaller segments during upload. \n\n* *a-put* and *rclone*  split large files automatically: [a-put](./a_commands.md#a-put-uploads-data-to-allas)\n\n* Using _Swift_, you can use the _Static Large Object_: [swift with large files](./swift_client.md#files-larger-than-5-gb)\n\n* _s3cmd_ splits large files automatically: [s3cmd put](./s3_client.md#create-buckets-and-upload-objects)\n\n\nAfter upload, s3cmd connects these segments into one large object, but in case of swift based uploads (a-put, rclone , swift) the large files are also stored as several objects. This is done automatically to a bucket that is named by adding extension `_segments` to the original bucket name. For example, if you would use _a-put_ to upload a large file to bucket _123-dataset_ the actual data would be stored as several pieces into bucket _123-dataset_segments_. The target bucket _123_dataset_ would contain just a front object that contains information what segments make the stored file. Operations performed to the front object are automatically reflected to the segments. Normally users don't need to operate with the _segments_ buckets at all and objects inside these buckets should not be deleted or modified. \n\n## Viewing\n\nIn CSC supercomputers you can check the number of objects and the amount of stored data in your current Allas project with command:\n```text\na-info\n```\n\nIf you are using the _s3cmd client_, check your project's object storage usage:\n```bash\ns3cmd du -H\n```\n\nIf you use the _Swift client_:\n```bash \nswift stat\n```\n\nDisplay how much space a bucket has used:\n```bash\nswift stat $bucketname\n```\n\nPlease contact [servicedesk@csc.fi](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi) if you have questions.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage solution for various types of data from multiple sources, including scientific instruments, meters, and social media streams)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing environment where virtual machines and computing jobs process data stored in object storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS-BACKUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool within a-commands for creating backup copies of files in Allas, not a real backup service but a method for copying data to another bucket in Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-PUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command that splits large files automatically during upload to Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command that splits large files automatically during upload to Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command used for uploading large files as Static Large Objects to Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S3CMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A command that splits large files automatically during upload and connects these segments into one large object in Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supercomputers at CSC where users can check the number of objects and the amount of stored data in their Allas project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICDESK@CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contact point for users having questions about their projects or storage usage in Allas)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>PUHTI<|>Data stored in object storage can be processed by virtual machines and computing jobs on Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS-BACKUP<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>Allas-backup is used for creating backup copies of files in object storage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-PUT<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>A-put is used for uploading large files to object storage, specifically Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RCLONE<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>Rclone is used for uploading large files to object storage, specifically Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SWIFT<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>Swift is used for uploading large files as Static Large Objects to object storage, specifically Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3CMD<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>S3cmd is used for uploading and managing large files in object storage, specifically Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>CSC supercomputers provide tools to check data stored in object storage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICDESK@CSC.FI<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>Service desk at CSC.fi provides support for questions related to object storage<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
