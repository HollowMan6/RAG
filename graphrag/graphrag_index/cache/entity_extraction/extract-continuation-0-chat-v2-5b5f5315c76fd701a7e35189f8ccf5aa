Dask Dashboard should be available whenever Dask is available, JupyterLab Dask extension requires extra installations (in Puhti it is available in [geoconda](../../apps/geoconda.md) module). \n\nBoth `LocalCluster` and `SLURMCluster` type clusters work. When [starting JupyterLab session](../../computing/webinterface/jupyter.md) in Puhti web interface, pay attention to computing resource reservation: \n\n* If using `LocalCluster`, reserve computing resources for it, notice the [interactive job](../../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) limits. Bigger resource requests are possible with `small` partition in Puhti. With `LocalCluster` maximum of one HPC node can be used, so 40 cores in Puhti.\n* If using `SLURMCluster`, at this phase only master node resources are reserved, 1 core should be enough.\n\n### Dask Dashboard on separate browser tab\n\n* Create new cluster from Python code.\n* Open [Dask Dashboard](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dashboard.html) in a separate browser tab. The URL is something like this: `https://puhti.csc.fi/rnode/r07c51.bullx/8787/status`. Replace the node name (`r07c51.bullx`), with the node used in your job, visible in URL of your Jupyter page, and the port number (`8787`), given in the printout after cluster is created on Dashboard row.\n\nInfo tab does not work in this set-up, but other tabs should work.\n\n### JupyterLab Dask extension\n\nThis currently only works when starting the cluster from the extension (not if the cluster is created within the notebook (e.g. together with the client)): \n\n1. Click on Dask logo in left sidebar. \n2. Click `+NEW`, which creates a new blue box `LocalCluster` where you can find all information about the newly created cluster.\n3. Click `<>`, which will create a new cell at cursor position in currently open notebook with all code needed to connect your notebook to the running cluster via a client.   \n4. Adapt your Client as needed, while keeping the address that is suggested by Dask extension.\n5. Run that cell to connect your notebook via the client to the running cluster.\n6. Find all available dashboards from the extension (orange boxes) and activate the ones you want with a click (draging allows you to dock multiple dashboard tabs side by side).\n\nPlease note:\n\n* It may take some time for the dashboards to load and show you any information in the tabs, be patient.\n* If you restart the kernel of your notebook, the cluster will stay active but you will need to re-connect it to the notebook the same way as described above.\n\n***\nAnother option would be to use [Jupyter opened the SSH tunnelling way](rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks.md) with an extra tunnel for the Jupyter Dashboard port.\n\n## References and further reading\n\n- [Dask homepage](https://dask.org/)\n- [Dask tutorials](https://tutorial.dask.org/index.html)\n- [Dask examples](https://examples.dask.org/)\n- [Full examples of Dask used in Puhti](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/puhti/06_parallel\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is an HPC node mentioned in the context of running Dask jobs and JupyterLab sessions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DASK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURMCLUSTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURMCluster is a part of Dask Jobqueue meant for managing SLURM jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTERLAB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>JupyterLab is an interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DASK DASHBOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dask Dashboard is a diagnostic tool provided by Dask for monitoring Dask clusters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTERLAB DASK EXTENSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An extension for JupyterLab that provides a user interface for Dask clusters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEOCONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Geoconda is a module available in Puhti for geospatial analysis, mentioned in the context of installing JupyterLab Dask extension)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DASK<|>SLURMCLUSTER<|>SLURMCluster is a component of Dask designed for managing jobs on SLURM-based systems<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DASK<|>DASK DASHBOARD<|>Dask Dashboard is a tool provided by Dask for real-time monitoring of Dask clusters<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTERLAB<|>JUPYTERLAB DASK EXTENSION<|>JupyterLab Dask Extension is a tool used within JupyterLab to manage and monitor Dask clusters<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEOCONDA<|>Geoconda is mentioned as a module available in Puhti, implying its use on the Puhti HPC for geospatial analysis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>DASK<|>Dask is used for parallel computing on the Puhti HPC node, indicating its deployment and use in this environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>JUPYTERLAB<|>JupyterLab sessions are mentioned in the context of being started in the Puhti web interface, indicating its support and use on Puhti<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
