As explained by the comments in the script above, HyperQueue works on a\n   worker-server-client basis, i.e. a worker is started on each compute node to\n   execute commands that the client submitted to the server.\n    - This is in principle what Slurm also does, only difference is that you\n      need to start the server and workers yourself.\n    - In this example, one full Puhti node is reserved for processing the\n      files, meaning that 40 conversion commands will be running in parallel.\n\n   ‚òùüèª Ideally, the number of sub-tasks should be larger than the amount that\n   can fit running on the reserved resources simultaneously to avoid too short\n   Slurm jobs.\n\n1. Submit the script with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sbatch hq.sh\n   ```\n\n2. After a short while, you should notice that a file `sdf.tar.gz` containing\n   the output files has appeared in your working directory. How long did it\n   take to convert all files?\n\nüí° Tip: If you want to monitor the progress of your HyperQueue jobs/tasks,\njust set the location of the HyperQueue server and use the `hq` commands\n(see the [official documentation for details](https://it4innovations.github.io/hyperqueue/stable/jobs/jobs/)).\nNote that the HQ job/task IDs are not the same as the Slurm job ID!\n\n```bash\nmodule load hyperqueue\nexport HQ_SERVER_DIR=${PWD}/hq-server-<slurmjobid>\nhq job list\nhq job info <hqjobid>\nhq job progress <hqjobid>\nhq task list <hqjobid>\nhq task info <hqjobid> <hqtaskid>\n```\n\n‚òùüèª Remember to load the `hyperqueue` module before running the commands\nabove from the terminal, otherwise you will get an error message\n`-bash: hq: command not found`.\n\n‚òùüèª Also note that these commands are available only after your job has\nstarted running.\n\nüí¨ To get a report of how your jobs/tasks completed and spot possible\nfailures, you could also run one of these commands in your batch script and\nredirect the output to a file before shutting down the server.\n\n## More information\n\n- [HyperQueue page in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/hyperqueue/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
