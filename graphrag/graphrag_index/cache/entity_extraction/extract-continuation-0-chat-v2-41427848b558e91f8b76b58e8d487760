These buckets\nwill store objects with metadata associated with these objects.\n\n- **Buckets**: Containers used to store one or more objects.\n  Object storage uses a flat structure with only\n  one level which means that buckets cannot contain other buckets.\n- **Objects**: Any type of data. An object is stored in a bucket.\n- **Metadata**: Both buckets and objects have metadata specific to them. The \n  metadata of a bucket specifies e.g., the access rights to the bucket. While\n  traditional file systems have fixed metadata (filename, creation date, type,\n  etc.), an object storage allows you to add custom metadata.\n\nTo use LUMI-O, you will need to generate authentication credentials, which you\ncan then use with different tools to connect to LUMI-O.\n\n## Configuring the LUMI-O connection\n\nStart by loading the `lumio` module which provides configuration and data\ntransfer tools:\n\n```\nmodule load lumio\n```\n\nTo configure a connection to LUMI-O, run the command:\n```text\nlumio-conf\n```\n\nThis command asks you to connect with your browser to the [LUMI-O credentials\nmanagement service](auth-lumidata-eu.md), create credentials there and the copy\nthe project number and keys for the setup tool. The setup process will create configuration files for `s3cmd`\nand `rclone`.\n\nFor a step-by-step description, read the [Creating LUMI-O\ncredentials](auth-lumidata-eu.md) instructions.\n\nUsing the [LUMI-O credentials management service,](auth-lumidata-eu.md) you can\nalso generate configuration for different object storage clients like shell,\nboto3, rclone, s3cmd and aws. This is useful for using LUMI-O from somewhere\nelse than LUMI, where the `lumio-conf` command is not available (The tool can be\ndownloaded from the [LUMI-O repository][lumi-o-tools], but we only officially\nsupport the tool on LUMI) \n\n## Tools to transfer data\n\nThe `lumio` module provides some pre-installed tools to interact with LUMI-O:\n`rclone`, `s3cmd` and `restic`.\n\nPlease refer to the manuals of the respective tools for more detailed information.\n\nThe most common commands for `s3cmd` and `rclone` to\n\n=== \"Rclone\"\n    \n    | Action                                     | Command                              |\n    |--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n    | List buckets                               | `rclone lsd lumi-o:`                 |\n    | Create bucket *mybuck*                     | `rclone mkdir lumi-o:mybuck`         |\n    | List objects in bucket *mybuck*            | `rclone ls lumi-o:mybuck/`           |\n    | Upload file *file1* to bucket *mybuck*     | `rclone copy file1 lumi-o:mybuck/`   |\n    | Download file *file1* from bucket *mybuck* | `rclone copy lumi-o:mybuck/file1 .`  |\n\n=== \"s3cmd\"\n\n    | Action                                     | Command                             |\n    |--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n    | List buckets                               | `s3cmd ls s3:`                      |\n    | Create bucket *mybuck*                     | `s3cmd mb s3://mybuck`              |\n    | List objects in bucket *mybuck*            | `s3cmd ls --recursive  s3://mybuck` |\n    | Upload file *file1* to bucket *mybuck*     | `s3cmd put file1 s3://mybuck`       |\n    | Download file *file1* from bucket *mybuck* | `s3cmd get s3://mybuck/file1 .`     |\n\n### rclone\n\nFor `rclone`, the LUMI-O configuration provides two remotes endpoints: \n\n- **lumi-o**: The private endpoint. The buckets and objects uploaded to this\n              endpoint will not be publicly accessible.\n- **lumi-pub**: The public endpoint. The buckets and objects uploaded to this\n                endpoint will publicly accessible using the URL:\n                ```\n                https://<project-number>.lumidata.eu/<bucket_name>`\n                ```\n                Be careful to not upload data that cannot be public to this\n                endpoint.\n\n\nThe basic syntax of the `rclone` command is:\n\n```text\nrclone <subcommand> <options> source:path dest:path \n```\n\nThe table below lists the most frequently used `rclone` subcommands:\n\n[rc_copy]:    https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/\n[rc_sync]:    https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/\n[rc_move]:    https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/\n[rc_delete]:  https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/\n[rc_mkdir]:   https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mkdir/\n[rc_rmdir]:   https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/\n[rc_check]:   https://rclone.org/commands/r\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-O<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI-O is an object store offering 30 PB storage for data storing, sharing, and staging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUCKETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Buckets are containers in LUMI-O used to store one or more objects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OBJECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Objects in LUMI-O represent any type of data stored within buckets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METADATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Metadata in LUMI-O is associated with buckets and objects, specifying attributes like access rights)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-O CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service for generating authentication credentials for LUMI-O)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S3CMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool pre-installed in the lumio module for interacting with LUMI-O)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool pre-installed in the lumio module for interacting with LUMI-O)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool pre-installed in the lumio module for interacting with LUMI-O)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-PUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The public endpoint in LUMI-O for uploading publicly accessible buckets and objects)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUCKETS<|>OBJECTS<|>Buckets are used to store objects in LUMI-O<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUCKETS<|>METADATA<|>Buckets have specific metadata defining their attributes in LUMI-O<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OBJECTS<|>METADATA<|>Objects have associated metadata that specifies their attributes in LUMI-O<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-O<|>LUMI-O CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE<|>LUMI-O users generate authentication credentials through the LUMI-O Credentials Management Service<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-O<|>S3CMD<|>S3CMD is a tool for interacting with LUMI-O<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-O<|>RCLONE<|>RCLONE is a tool for interacting with LUMI-O<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-O<|>RESTIC<|>RESTIC is a tool for interacting with LUMI-O<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-O<|>LUMI-PUB<|>LUMI-PUB is a public endpoint for LUMI-O, making uploaded data publicly accessible<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
