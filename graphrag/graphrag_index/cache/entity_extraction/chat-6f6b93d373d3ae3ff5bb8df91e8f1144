To start using the service,\n[register a CSC account and create a project](https://research.csc.fi/accounts-and-projects).\nNote that EUDAT services have their own registration process.\n\n## CSC's services for storing data\n\n[Store and Share Data](https://research.csc.fi/storage)\n\n[Storage Comparison Table](#storage-comparison-table)\n\n[Services for Sensitive Data](../sensitive-data/index.md)\n([SD Connect](../sensitive-data/sd_connect.md) and\n[Federated EGA](../sensitive-data/federatedega.md))\n\n[Allas Object Storage Service](../Allas/index.md)\n\n[Using Allas to host a data set for a research project](../Allas/allas_project_example.md)\n\n[Fairdata Services](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/)\n\n[EUDAT Services](https://www.eudat.eu/)\n\n[Digital Preservation Service for Research Data](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/dps-for-research-data/)\n\n[Moving datasets in CSC's environment](../moving/scp.md)\n\n## What to consider when choosing a suitable storage solution\n\nWhen you are looking for a place to store data during your research project,\nyou should consider:\n\n1. does the data contain personal information and/or sensitive data, see\n   [definition of sensitive data](https://research.csc.fi/definition-of-sensitive-data)\n2. how will the data be used (as a backup, ready for analysis, etc.)\n3. who decides the data lifecycle\n    - what happens to your data if you leave the university/research\n      organization\n    - who needs to have access to the data\n4. what kind of interfaces are needed (e.g. browser-based graphical user\n   interfaces for audio/video/table, machine-readable interfaces, a mountable\n   path for operating system etc.)\n5. [how much storage space is needed](#how-much-storage-space-is-needed) and is\n   the need cumulative\n    - are you able to pay for data storage costs, if needed\n6. how big are the individual files (e.g. it is not sensible to store too small\n   files or too big files)\n7. should the file transfer be automated e.g. with a script\n8. do you need to store metadata with your data and what type of metadata\n9. what level of security does your data require\n\nAfter you have decided which storage solution to use, you should think through\nhow you [organize your data](metadata-and-documentation.md#data-organization).\n\n## When the research project ends\n\nAs the research project ends, you need to consider:\n\n- what data should be [published](publishing-datasets.md)\n- for how long do you need to retain the data according to the requirements of\n  the funder, publisher or your home organization\n- what data can be deleted at this point\n- do you have valuable data that needs to be digitally\n  [preserved](hosting-datasets-at-CSC.md#preservation)\n\nAlthough it may be tempting to deposit all of your data just in case it proves\nuseful in the future, this is not always possible, as archiving everything\ncould prove to be costly and time-consuming and in some cases, unethical. If\nyou are gathering data from human research participants, you will also need to\nensure that you have gained their informed and valid consent for the specific\narchival, share and re-use. Files that are not published, archived or preserved\nshould be deleted when they have fulfilled their purpose. Researchers have a\nlegal responsibility for collected data and sensitive data should be\nappropriately disposed. Deleting files is not enough as tools are available to\nretrieve deleted data. You need to make sure that the data you want to discard,\nespecially in cases of \"special category personal data\", is completely wiped\nfrom hard drives, portable drives and storage solutions of any other kind.  \n\n## Preservation\n\nDigital preservation refers to the reliable preservation of digital information\nfor several decades or even centuries. Hardware, software, and file formats\nwill become outdated while the information must be preserved. Reliable digital\npreservation requires active monitoring of information integrity and\nanticipation of various risks. Metadata, which describes for example the\ninformation content, provenance information and how the content can be used,\nhas a key role in this.\n\nThe [National Digital Preservation Services](http://digitalpreservation.fi/en)\nfor research data ensures the availability and preservation of digital research\nresources. Here you can find more information about\n[becoming a partner organization with the Digital Preservation Service for Research Data](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/dps-organisations/).\n\nLearn more about the preservation of research data in this video:\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/arJ5jJP_eOM\" title=\"Manage well and get preserved - 5. Preservation metadata\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n## How much storage space is needed\n\nThe user of CSC's services must estimate the size of storage space required,\nfor example in gibibytes (GiB). One way to do this is to check the size of any\nexisting files and assess the final space requirement based on these. The quota\nsize of most CSC services can easily be increased (or decreased) in the\n[MyCSC customer portal](../../accounts/how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md).\n\n!!! note\n    Gibibyte (GiB)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
