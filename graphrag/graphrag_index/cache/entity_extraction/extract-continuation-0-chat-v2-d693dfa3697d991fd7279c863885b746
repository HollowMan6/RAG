Given the nature of the text, it primarily involves organizations and lacks direct mentions of persons, geographical locations, or specific events. However, I'll ensure to capture any relevant entities and their relationships that were previously missed, sticking strictly to the mentioned entity types.\n\nGiven the context and instructions, it seems there were no direct mentions of additional entities within the specified types (organization, person, geo, event) beyond what was initially extracted. The text focuses on the usage of resources within a computing context, mentioning several services (Puhti, NetApp, cPouta, ePouta, Rahti) and a platform (MyCSC) without referencing specific geographical locations, persons, or events. \n\nThe entities extracted relate to the organizations involved in providing computing resources and services. The relationships identified are between MyCSC and these services based on the reporting of usage statistics.
