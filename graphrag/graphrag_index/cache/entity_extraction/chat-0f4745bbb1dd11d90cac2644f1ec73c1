The steps to make it so are:\n\n1. Login into Rahti and, if needed, create a [new Rahti project](../usage/projects_and_quota.md#creating-a-project).\n\n2. Create a secret of type `docker-registry`. And link with the Service account that will run the build:\n\n    ```sh\n    oc create secret --docker-server=<url> docker-registry <url> \\\n                     --docker-username=<user> --docker-password=<token>\n    oc secrets link builder <url>\n    ```\n\n    - **url** is the url of the registry. In case of docker hub the value should be `docker.io`, and for GitHub Packages it will be `ghcr.io`.\n    - **user** is the username needed to login in the registry.\n    - **password** is the password or token. It is recommended to avoid using a password and better use very narrow purpose TOKEN that ideally only allow to push images and nothing else.  \n\n3. Create the build:\n\n    ```sh\n    oc new-build --binary --to-docker=true \\\n                 --to=<image-url>:<tag> \\\n                 --name tutorial\n    ```\n\n    * **image-url:tag** is the url of the image that you are building. It is the same URL that you will later use to pull the image using `docker pull`.\n    * The **name** can be anything that helps you remember what is this build for.\n\n4. Set the build secret for `push`:\n\n    ```sh\n    oc set build-secret --push bc/tutorial <url>\n    ```\n\n    * <url> is the same as in step 2.\n\n    !!! Info \"Pull private image\"\n        If you are building from a private image you can run the same command again replacing `--push` by `--pull`\n\n5. Test it. You can test the build by running the `oc start-build` command. The directory (`.` in the example below), must have a `Dockerfile`. You can also use the other methods described in the [Creating images](./creating.md#using-the-inline-dockerfile-method) article.\n\n    ```sh\n    oc start-build tutorial --from-dir=.\n    ```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
