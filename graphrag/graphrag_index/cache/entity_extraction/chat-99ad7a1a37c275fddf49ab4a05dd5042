It can be used\nto install complicated scientific software packages easily. CSC installs the\ndevelopment stack, including compilers, MPI libraries and also many other\nlibraries and applications using Spack. CSC provides also a user module for\ncustomers that enables per-project software installations using Spack.\n\n!!! warning \"Note\"\n    Spack is an advanced tool and it requires understanding of\n    compiling and linking programs.\n\n!!! info \"Available versions\"\n    This tutorial assumes you are on Puhti, which has `spack/v0.18-user`\n    installed. Mahti has two versions of Spack available for users,\n    `spack/v0.17-user` and `spack/v0.20-user`. Aside from the module versions,\n    the outlined procedure is identical on the two systems.\n\n## Creating a Spack instance\n\nBefore running the Spack module for the first time, you have to prepare an\ninstallation location that can reside either on `/projappl` or `/scratch` disk\nareas. You also have to set an environment variable that points to the location\nof the Spack instance.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a Spack instance in the `/projappl`\ndirectory, you can initialize the environment as follows:\n\n```bash\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ module purge\nThe following modules were not unloaded:\n  (Use \"module --force purge\" to unload all):\n\n  1) csc-tools\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ export USER_SPACK_ROOT=/projappl/project_2001234/spack-instance-1\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ mkdir -p ${USER_SPACK_ROOT}\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ module load spack/v0.18-user\nRun user-spack-init to initialize user installation in /projappl/project_2001234/spack-instance-1\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ user-spack-init\n[INFO] USER_SPACK_GROUP not set, defaulting to project_2001234 based on target directory\n```\n\n!!! info \"Purge before loading\"\n    Before loading Spack, you have to run `module purge` to purge all default\n    environment compilers and library modules as they may interfere with Spack\n    builds.\n\n!!! info \"Several Spack instances\"\n    You can have several Spack instances under the same project. The used\n    instance is specified with the `$USER_SPACK_ROOT` environment variable that\n    points to the root directory of the instance.\n\n!!! info \"Initializing\"\n    Before accessing the Spack instance for the first time, you have to\n    initialize it by running the `user-spack-init` command.\n\n## Using the Spack instance\n\nAn initialized instance can be activated by purging the module environment,\nsetting the root path of the instance and loading the Spack module:\n\n```bash\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ module purge\nThe following modules were not unloaded:\n  (Use \"module --force purge\" to unload all):\n\n  1) csc-tools\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ export USER_SPACK_ROOT=/projappl/project_2001234/spack-instance-1\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ module load spack/v0.18-user\nFound existing user spack installation at /projappl/project_2001234/spack-instance-1\n```\n\n### Example build\n\n```bash\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ spack spec -I --reuse kakoune\nInput spec\n--------------------------------\n -   kakoune\n\nConcretized\n--------------------------------\n -   kakoune@2021.11.08%gcc@11.3.0 arch=linux-rhel8-cascadelake\n[^]      ^ncurses@6.2%gcc@11.3.0~symlinks+termlib abi=none arch=linux-rhel8-cascadelake\n[^]          ^pkgconf@1.8.0%gcc@11.3.0 arch=linux-rhel8-cascadelake\n```\n\nThe `spack spec` command shows what would be installed given a certain input.\nIt is good practice to run it before installing to ensure that the build looks\nlike intended. The `-I` flag is used to display the current install status of\nthe package and its dependencies, while the `--reuse` flag is provided in order\nto reuse already installed dependencies whenever possible. Actual installation\nis then performed via the `spack install` command:\n\n```bash\n[maijam@puhti-login11 ~]$ spack install --reuse kakoune\n[+] /appl/spack/v018/install-tree/gcc-11.3.0/pkgconf-1.8.0-2hkydh\n[+] /appl/spack/v018/install-tree/gcc-11.3.0/ncurses-6.2-n4phtn\n==> Installing kakoune-2021.11.08-yh4nmfid4st4l7gsmuzqv43o6qt6ckrm\n==> No binary for kakoune-2021.11.08-yh4nmfid4st4l7gsmuzqv43o6qt6ckrm found: installing from source\n==> Using cached archive: /local_scratch/maijam/spack-build-project_2002567/source-cache/_source-cache/archive/aa/aa30889d9da11331a243a8f40fe4f6a8619321b19217debac8f565e\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
