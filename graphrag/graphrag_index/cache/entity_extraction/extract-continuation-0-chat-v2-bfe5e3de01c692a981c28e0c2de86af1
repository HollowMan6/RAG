This requires NIR band to be in the first channel and RED band in the second\n\n`otbcli_RadiometricIndices -in <virtual raster> -channels.nir 1 -channels.red 2 -list Vegetation:NDVI -out <output_file>`\n\n### Using the OTB Python tools\n\nThe applications included in OTB can also be run by using the Python bindings included in the module.\n\nHere's an example how to run mean raster calculation on a test virtual raster with Python.\n\n```\nimport otbApplication as otb\n\nfp = <INPUT RASTER FILEPATH>\n\nout = <OUTPUT RASTER FILEPATH>\n\napp = otb.Registry.CreateApplication(\"Smoothing\")\napp.SetParameterString(\"in\", fp)\napp.SetParameterString(\"type\", \"mean\")\napp.SetParameterString(\"out\", out)\napp.ExecuteAndWriteOutput()\n```\n\n### Using the graphical tools\n\nStart [Monteverdi](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook-8.0/Monteverdi.html):\n```\nmonteverdi\n```\nAlso other graphical tools available, see 'ls /appl/soft/geo/orfeotoolbox/8.0.1/bin/otbgui*' for full list. \n\n### Running OTB applications in parallel \n\nOTB applications seem to scale the number of processing threads automatically which means that the applications generally run faster when given more CPU cores. \n\nHere is an example batch job script with 4 CPU cores\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=<name_of_your_job>\n#SBATCH --account=<your_project>\n#SBATCH --time=00:03:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2000\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nmodule load otb\n\notbcli_RadiometricIndices -in test_vrt.vrt -channels.nir 1 -channels.red 2 -list Vegetation:NDVI -out NDVI.tif\n```\n\n!!! note\n    It is also possible to run OTB in parallel in several computing nodes [using MPI](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/CliInterface.html#parallel-execution-with-mpi) but it has not been tested yet on Puhti\n\n## License \n\nOrfeo ToolBox is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
