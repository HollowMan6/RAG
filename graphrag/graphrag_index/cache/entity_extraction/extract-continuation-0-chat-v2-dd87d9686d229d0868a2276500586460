Important to request only the resources you need and ensure that the resources are used efficiently\n- Even if you _can_ use more resources, should you?\n\n# One resource type will be a bottleneck\n\n<div class=\"column\">\n- A single node can host many jobs from different users\n- Different jobs need different resources\n- Typically, the cores run out before the memory does\n- Sometimes a job uses only one core, but will consume all memory\n   - No further jobs will fit in the node\n   - If the job is _not_ using the memory (just reserving it), resources are wasted\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](img/node-cpu-full.svg \"Node cpu full\"){width=45%}\n![](img/node-mem-full.svg \"Node memory full from one job\"){width=45%}\n</div>\n\n# Slurm accounting: batch job resource usage 1/2\n\n<div class=\"column\">\n- Resource usage can be queried with `seff <slurm jobid>`\n- Points to pay attention to:\n   - Low CPU Efficiency:\n      - Too many cores requested?\n      - Cores waiting for other processes?\n      - Cores waiting for data from disk?\n      - Cores spread over too many nodes?\n   - Low Memory Efficiency:\n      - Too much memory requested?\n      - Lots of caveats here\n   - Low GPU efficiency:\n      - Better to use CPUs?

Querying data from the Slurm accounting database with `sacct` can be a very heavy operation\n      - **Don't** query long time intervals or run `sacct` in a loop/using `watch` as this will degrade the performance of the system for all users\n\n# Billing units\n\n- CPU time and storage space consume \"[Billing units](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/billing/)\" (BU)\n- BUs are a property of computing projects, not users\n- Monitor the BU usage of your project(s) from the command-line with `csc-projects`\n   - For help/options, try `csc-projects -h`\n- Batch job billing scheme:\n   - Amount of resources allocated: All requested resources are billed, i.e. number of cores, amount of memory, NVMe, ...\n   - Time allocated: Resources are billed based on the actual (wall) _time_ a job has **used**, not the reserved maximum time\n\n# Applying for Billing units\n\n- Billing units can be applied via the [Projects page in My CSC](https://my.csc.fi/welcome)\n   - Please acknowledge using CSC resources in your publications\n   - Please also inform us about your work by adding your publications to the resource application!\n- Academic usage is one of the [free-of-charge use cases](https://research.csc.fi/pricing)\n- You can estimate [usage with the online billing calculator](https://research.csc.fi/billing-and-monitoring#buc)\n   - The calculator can also be used to estimate the value of the resources\n- For companies interested in using CSC's HPC services, please see our [solutions for business](https://www.csc.fi/solutions-for-business)\n   - [LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/) has a substantial amount of [affordable](https://www.csc.fi/en/solutions-for-business-use-of-computing-services-and-pricing) computing resources (especially GPUs) available for industrial use!\n\n# BUs are also a metric for comparing usage efficiency\n\n- Different resources have different rates\n   - 1 CPU core hour on Puhti equals 1 BU\n   - 1 GPU card hour on Puhti equals 60 BU (+ allocated CPU cores)\n   - 1 node hour on Mahti equals 100 BU\n   - 1 GiB hour of Memory on Puhti equals 0.1 BU\n   - 1st TiB of disk quota (`/scratch`, `/projappl`) is free-of-charge (0 BU)\n      - Applied excess quota is\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd. is responsible for providing HPC resources and training for optimizing resource usage in their environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE 4.0 UNPORTED LICENSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A license under which the lecture materials are shared, allowing for redistribution and adaptation with attribution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm Workload Manager is a free, open-source job scheduler used for allocating resources on HPC clusters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of the supercomputers at CSC, offering CPU and GPU resources for various computing tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another supercomputer at CSC, known for its high-performance computing capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer providing substantial computing resources, including GPUs, for both academic and industrial use)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE 4.0 UNPORTED LICENSE<|>CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd. uses the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 Unported License for their lecture materials<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>SLURM<|>CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd. utilizes Slurm for managing jobs on their HPC resources<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti is one of the supercomputers provided by CSC for HPC tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>MAHTI<|>Mahti is provided by CSC for high-performance computing tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>LUMI<|>LUMI is a supercomputer offered by CSC for both academic and industrial computing needs<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
