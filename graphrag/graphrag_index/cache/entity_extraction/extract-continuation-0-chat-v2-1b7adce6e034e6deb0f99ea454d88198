Working efficiently with data\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 1\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/data-io/tutorial_allas-in-batch-jobs.html\n---\n\n# Using Allas in batch jobs\n\n## Preparations\n\nüí¨ The `allas-conf` command opens an Allas connection that is valid for eight\nhours.\n\n- In case of interactive usage, this eight-hour limit is not problematic as\n  `allas-conf` can be executed again to extend the validity of the connection.\n- In case of batch jobs, the situation is different, as it may take more than\n  eight hours before the job even starts!\n\n1. To be able to use Allas in a batch job, load the Allas module and run\n   `allas-conf` again with the `-k` option:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load allas\n   allas-conf -k \n   ```\n\n   - Here, the option `-k` indicates that the password will be stored in an\n     environment variable `$OS_PASSWORD`. With this variable defined, you no\n     longer need to input your password when you re-execute `allas-conf` with\n     the `-k` option and the Allas project name.\n\n   ‚òùüèª Note that if you mistype your password when using the `-k` option, you\n   must use the command `unset OS_PASSWORD` before you can try again.\n\n3. Refresh the connection with the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   allas-conf -k <project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n   ‚òùüèª When `$OS_PASSWORD` is set, the `a-commands` (`a-put`, `a-get`, `a-list`,\n   `a-delete`) automatically refresh the Allas connection when the commands are\n   executed in a batch job.\n\n4. Choose a file from Allas. The file should have text in it. You can use the\n   one you created in\n   [one of the earlier tutorials](../../part-1/allas/allas-usage.md),\n   or then any other text file you have in Allas:\n\n   ```bash\n   a-list <project_number>_$USER  # replace <project_number> with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234, to match the bucket you created earlier\n   ```\n\n5. Create a new batch job script. First open a new text file with the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   nano allas_job.sh\n   ```\n\n6. **Option 1:** `a-commands`\n   1. Copy the batch job script below to the text file you are editing:\n\n      ```bash\n      #!/bin/bash\n      #SBATCH --job-name=my_allas_job          # Name of the job visible in the queue\n      #SBATCH --account=<project>              # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n      #SBATCH --time=00:05:00                  # Maximum duration of the job. Max: depends of the partition\n      #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G                 # How much RAM is reserved for one processor\n      #SBATCH --partition=test                 # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, ...\n      #SBATCH --output=allas_output_%j.txt     # Name of the output-file\n      #SBATCH --error=allas_errors_%j.txt      # Name of the error-file\n        \n      bucketname=<project_number>_$USER        # Replace with your bucket name, e.g. 2001234_username\n      filename=<filename>                      # Replace with your file name\n        \n      a-get $bucketname/$filename              # Bucket name / file name\n      wc -l $filename > $filename.num_rows     # file name\n      a-put -b $bucketname $filename.num_rows\n      ```\n\n   2. In the script, replace `<project_number>_$USER` to match your bucket name\n   and `<filename>` to the name of the file you have in Allas. Remember to also\n   define your billing project (`--account`).\n\n7. **Option 2:** `rclone`  \n   \n   ‚òùüèª If you use `rclone` or `swift` instead of the `a-commands`, you need to\n   add `source allas_conf` commands to your script.\n   \n   1. Copy the batch job script below to the text file you are editing:   \n\n      ```bash\n      #!/bin/bash\n      #SBATCH --job-name=my_allas_job          # Name of the job visible in the queue.\n      #SBATCH --account=<project>              # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n      #SBATCH --time=00:05:00                  # Maximum duration of the job. Max: depends of the partition. \n      #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G                 # How much RAM is reserved for one processor.\n      #SBATCH --partition=test                 # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, $\n      #SBATCH --output=allas_output_%j.txt     # Name of the output-file.\n      #SBATCH --error=allas_errors_%j.txt      # Name of the error-file.\n      \n      bucketname=<project_number>_$USER        # Replace with your bucket name, e.g. 2001234_username\n      filename=<filename>                      # Replace with your file name\n      \n      # Make sure the connection to Allas is open\n      source /appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/allas-cli\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a data management service provided by CSC for storing and managing large datasets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>EVENT<|>Command to open an Allas connection valid for eight hours)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OS_PASSWORD<|>EVENT<|>Environment variable used to store the password for Allas connection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-COMMANDS<|>EVENT<|>Commands (`a-put`, `a-get`, `a-list`, `a-delete`) used to interact with Allas in batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>EVENT<|>An alternative method to `a-commands` for interacting with Allas in batch jobs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>ALLAS<|>Allas-Conf is used to establish a connection to the Allas service<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS_PASSWORD<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>OS_PASSWORD is used in conjunction with Allas-Conf to store the connection password<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-COMMANDS<|>ALLAS<|>A-Commands are utilized to perform operations within the Allas service<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RCLONE<|>ALLAS<|>Rclone can be used as an alternative to A-Commands for file operations in Allas<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
