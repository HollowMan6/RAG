While they are free\nfor individual use, their licensing terms do not allow CSC to make a public installation of them.\nEach user needs to license and install them for their own use.\n\n\n### GeneMark\n\nGo to [GeneMark download page](http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/license_download.cgi), and fill in the form. The version you need is \"GeneMark-ES/ET/EP+\" for \"LINUX 64 kernel 3.10 - 5\". Download the program file and the license key. To uncompress the packages:\n\n```bash\ntar xf gmes_linux_64_4.tar.gz\ngunzip gm_key_64.gz\n```\n\nCopy the uncompressed key file to your home directory.\n\n```bash\ncp gm_key_64 $HOME\n```\n\nTo tell BRAKER where to find GeneMark, use command line option `--GENEMARK_PATH` to point to install location.\n\n```txt\n--GENEMARK_PATH=/path/to/gmes_linux_64_4\n```\n\nBRAKER module contains all the necessary dependencies.\n\n\n### ProtHint\n\nDownload and uncompress ProtHint.\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/gatech-genemark/ProtHint/releases/download/v2.6.0/ProtHint-2.6.0.tar.gz\ntar xf ProtHint-2.6.0.tar.gz\n```\n\nUse command line option `--PROTHINT_PATH`to point to install location.\n\n```text\n--PROTHINT_PATH=/path/to/ProtHint-2.6.0/bin\n```\n\nBRAKER module contains all the necessary dependencies.\n\n\n### AUGUSTUS\n\nAUGUSTUS is included in the installation, but you will need your own copy of AUGUSTUS config directory, as it needs to be writable by the user. You can create this by running command:\n\n```bash\ncopy_config\n```\n\nIt will create directory `config` in your current directory.\n\nUse command line option `--AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH` to point to the config directory\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIn Puhti BRAKER should be used only in batch jobs. Either in normal batch jobs or in interactive batch jobs.\n\n\n### Interactive usage\n\nYou can start interactive batch job with command:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive -i\n```\n\nBRAKER can utilize several computing cores and can require significant amount of memory so you should reserve\nmore than the default resources for your interactive batch job. For example 4 cores and 32 GB of memory.\n\nIn batch job, you can initialize BRAKER environment with command\n\n```bash\nmodule load braker\n```\n\nAfter that you can launch a BRAKER job with command:\n\n```bash\nbraker.pl\n```\n\nTo see the options, run command:\n\n```bash\nbraker.pl --help\n```\n\nSample BRAKER command in Puhti:\n\n```bash\nbraker.pl --species=sp1 --genome=Drosophila.dna.fa --prot_seq=Drosophila.pep.fa --prg=gth --trainFromGth --AUGUSTUS_ab_initio --cores=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --GENEMARK_PATH=/path/to/gmes_linux_64_4 --PROTHINT_PATH=/path/to/ProtHint-2.6.0/bin --AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH /path/to/config\n```\n\n\n### Batch jobs\n\nSample batch job scrip for BRAKER:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=BRAKER_Job\n#SBATCH --account=project_2012345\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem=32000\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\n# load braker\nmodule load braker\n\n# Use correct paths instead of \"/path/to\"\nbraker.pl --species=sp1 --genome=Drosophila.dna.fa --prot_seq=Drosophila.pep.fa \\\n--prg=gth --trainFromGth --AUGUSTUS_ab_initio --cores=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK \\\n--GENEMARK_PATH=/path/to/gmes_linux_64_4 \\\n--PROTHINT_PATH=/path/to/ProtHint-2.6.0/bin \\\n--AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH /path/to/config\n```\n\nIn the batch job example above one task (--ntasks 1) is executed. The BRAKER job uses 8 cores (--cpus-per-task=8 ) with total of 32 GB of memory (--mem=32000).\nThe maximum duration of the job is ten hours (--time 10:00:00 ).\nAll the cores are assigned from one computing node (--nodes=1 ).\nIn the example the project that will be used is _project_2012345_.\nThis value shuold be replaced by the name of your computing project.\n\nYou can submit the batch job file to the batch job system with command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file.bash\n```\n\nSee the [Puhti user guide\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRAKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BRAKER is a tool for eukaryotic genome annotation using genomic and RNA-Seq data to automatically generate full gene structure annotations in novel genomes, based on GeneMark-ET R2 and AUGUSTUS pipelines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEMARK-ET R2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Part of the BRAKER pipeline for genome annotation, used for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUGUSTUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software pipeline included in BRAKER for predicting genes in eukaryotic genomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Computing environment where BRAKER versions 2.1.6 and 3.0.7 are available for use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEMARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software package for gene prediction, required by BRAKER but needs to be installed separately by the user due to licensing restrictions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTHINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software package that provides hints for gene prediction to AUGUSTUS, part of the BRAKER pipeline but needs separate installation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAKER<|>GENEMARK-ET R2<|>BRAKER uses GeneMark-ET R2 as part of its genome annotation process<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAKER<|>AUGUSTUS<|>BRAKER uses AUGUSTUS for gene prediction in its genome annotation process<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAKER<|>PUHTI<|>BRAKER is available for use in the Puhti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAKER<|>GENEMARK<|>BRAKER requires GeneMark for gene prediction but it must be installed separately by the user<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAKER<|>PROTHINT<|>BRAKER uses ProtHint for providing hints to AUGUSTUS, but it needs separate installation<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
