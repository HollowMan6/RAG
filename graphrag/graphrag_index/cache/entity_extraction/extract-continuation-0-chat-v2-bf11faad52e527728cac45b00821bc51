The only\ndifference is that in the batch jobs, the database password\ncan't be given interactively. Instead it should be given by\nusing MySQL configuration file (`.my.cnf`) in the home directory.\n\nBelow is a sample MySQL script for Puhti. First we need to create\na MySQL connection configuration file that locates in the home\ndirectory.  In this case we use user account `mydb1_admin`,\nwhose password is `abc123`.  The file, named as `.my.cnf`,\nwould now look like following:\n\n```text\n[client]\nuser =  mydb1_admin\npassword = abc123\nhost = kaivos.csc.fi\n```\n\nThen we create the actual batch job script. The script below\nreserves 12 h time and 1 GB memory to run the MySQL query that\nis defined in the file `query_commands.sql`. The query is made\nto database `mydb1` and the connection parameters are read from\nfile `.my.cnf` . The results are written to the `results.txt` file.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=mysql_job\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=12:00:00\n#SBATCH --account=project_example\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1024\n\nmodule load mariadb/10.8.2\ncd /path/to/my_data\n\nmysql --local mydb1 <query_commands.sql > results.txt\n```\n\n## Example: Using MySQL database from a batch job script in Puhti\n\nThe MySQL database in `kaivos.csc.fi` is intended for cases where\ncomputing servers of CSC use the MySQL database to store and\nanalyze data. In these cases the database is normally not used\ninteractively, but the MySQL client is used automatically from\na shell or program script.\n\nBelow is a a sample mysql session where database called `DB_A`\nis accessed using the database user account `DB_A_admin`  and\npassword `abc123`.  \nIn Puhti the command is run under project: project_2000136. The\ndatabase user account information is first stored into `.my.cnf` in home directory:\n\n```text\n[client]\nuser =  DB_A_admin\npassword = abc123\nhost = kaivos.csc.fi\n```\n\nBelow is a sample batch job script, called as `kaivos.bash`,\nthat utilizes `kaivos.csc.fi` within the batch queue system.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job.name=mysql_job\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=12:00:00\n#SBATCH --account=project_2000136\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1024\n\n#load mariadb environment\nmodule load mariadb/10.8.2\n\n# go to the right directory\ncd datadir\n\n# run the analysis\nmy_program < inputfile30.data > results.30\n\n#feed the data to the database\nmysqlimport --local --compress DB_A results.30\n\n#change the status value in the dataset_table\nmysql --local DB_A <<EOF\n   UPDATE dataset_table SET status=\"done\" WHERE name=\"inputfile30.data\" ;\nEOF\n\n#remove the original results file\nrm -f results.30\n```\n\nThe sample script above first analyzes a file called `inputfile30.data`\nwith program `my_program`. The results are first written to file called\n`results.30` . The data in this file is then imported to a database with\n`mysqlimport` command. Note that the script assumes that a table called\n`results` already exists in the database `DB_A` and that the columns in\nthe results file are in the same order as in the database table.\n\nAfter importing the data to the database the script launches another\nMySQL command. The second command modifies an existing table called\n`dataset_table`. The mysql command changes the status value in this\ntable so that in the row where the `name` column contains the value\n`inputfile30.data`, the `status` column gets the value: `done`.\n\nThe `kaivos.bash` script, described above, can be submitted to the\nbatch job system of Puhti with command\n\n```bash\nsbatch kaivos.bash\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MYSQL CLIENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program used to interact with MySQL databases, capable of being used in batch job systems without interactive password input)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing environment where MySQL databases are accessed and manipulated through batch job scripts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYDB1_ADMIN<|>PERSON<|>A user account for database administration with specified credentials in a MySQL configuration file)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>GEO<|>The host server for MySQL databases intended for CSC computing servers' use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DB_A_ADMIN<|>PERSON<|>A database user account for accessing and managing the DB_A database)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DB_A<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A MySQL database accessed using specific user account credentials for data storage and analysis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYDB1_ADMIN<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>The MYDB1_ADMIN account is used to access databases hosted on kaivos.csc.fi<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DB_A_ADMIN<|>DB_A<|>The DB_A_ADMIN account is specifically for accessing and managing the DB_A database<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DB_A<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>DB_A is a database hosted on the kaivos.csc.fi server<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>KAIVOS.CSC.FI<|>Puhti utilizes kaivos.csc.fi for MySQL database operations within batch job scripts<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
