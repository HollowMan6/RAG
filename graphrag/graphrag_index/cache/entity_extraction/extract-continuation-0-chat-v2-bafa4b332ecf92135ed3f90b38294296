The cPouta cloud is the public cloud which \nis easily accessible via the internet. The ePouta cloud is a virtual \nprivate cloud designed to meet the security requirements of handling \nsensitive data. Both the cPouta and ePouta clouds run on the OpenStack \ncloud software. The Pouta cloud services are suitable for most kinds of \ncomputational workloads and any other supporting services these workloads \nmight need.\n\nThe cPouta virtual machines can be connected to external IP addresses,\nand in this case they can be directly accessed on the internet. This\nhelps customers run widely available services, but the customers must\nalso take care to secure their machines. The virtual machines do not\nhave access to any other part of CSC's infrastructure, other than what\nis already visible on the internet. Application data and software must\nbe uploaded either via the internet or copied from CSC's existing\nshared storage services.\n \nThe ePouta cloud services are well suited for computational workloads\ninvolving sensitive data as well as extending a customer's existing IT\ninfrastructure. The ePouta cloud services are attached to the customer's\ninfrastructure and can be used to analyse sensitive data which may\nrequire large amounts of memory or clustered I/O performance, a remote\ndesktop for processing sensitive data etc. The virtual machines in the\nePouta cloud may optionally have network access to specific sensitive\ndata repositories at CSC.\n\n## Accessing the Pouta services\n\nDue to the nature of ePouta, it is not available as a self-service. Questions regarding ePouta should be directed to our helpdesk (<servicedesk@csc.fi>).\n\ncPouta is self-service and you can find more information on how to get access here: [Applying for cPouta access](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md).\n\n ePouta access is **not** self-service. The process is described in [Applying for ePouta access](ePouta-access.md).\n\nThe web interfaces of the Pouta clouds are available at following addresses:\n\n| URL | Service name | Access |\n| :-------------| :-------------| :-----|\n| [https://pouta.csc.fi](https://pouta.csc.fi) | cPouta web interface | Accessible on the internet using Haka, Virtu, etc. |\n| [https://epouta.csc.fi](https://epouta.csc.fi) | ePouta web interface | Accessible only from IPs provided for accessing the management interfaces of ePouta using CSC account. |\n\nLogin is available for [supported account types](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md) like Haka and Virtu.\n\n![Pouta web login page](../img/pouta_overview_web_login.png)\n\nOnce you have successfully logged in, you can continue with the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md). Pay also attention to the  [Security guidelines for Pouta](security.md) and the [Pouta accounting principles and quotas](accounting.md).\n\nIf you are already familiar with the basics of OpenStack, please go directly to the [Configuration](configuration.md) and [Advanced](advanced.md) sections of the Pouta documentation.\n\nOther useful links are:\n\n## Using Pouta\n\n* [Virtual machine flavors and billing unit rates](vm-flavors-and-billing.md)\n* [Launching a virtual machine with the cPouta web interface](launch-vm-from-web-gui.md)\n* [DNS names for virtual machines](additional-services.md#dns-services-in-cpouta)\n* [Connecting to your virtual machine](connecting-to-vm.md)\n* [Command line client tools](command-line-tools.md)\n    * [Installing command line tools](install-client.md)\n* [Virtual machine lifecycle and saving billing units](vm-lifecycle.md)\n* [Orchestration with Heat](heat-orchestration.md)\n* [Application development practises in Pouta](application-dev.md)\n* [Creating and uploading virtual machine images](adding-images.md)\n* [Additional services in Pouta (email, DNS)](additional-services.md)\n\n## Storage in Pouta\n\n* [Introduction](storage.md)\n* [Ephemeral storage](ephemeral-storage.md)\n* [Persistent volumes](persistent-volumes.md)\n* [Snapshots](snapshots.md)\n\n## Self study and troubleshooting\n\n* [Pouta videos](pouta-videos.md)\n* [Known problems and limitations](known-problems.md)\n* [Pouta FAQ](../../support/faq/index.md#pouta)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides IaaS cloud services through cPouta and ePouta, utilizing OpenStack cloud software for computational workloads and sensitive data handling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Public cloud service offered by CSC, accessible via the internet for computational workloads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Virtual private cloud service by CSC for handling sensitive data with high security requirements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing software platform used by CSC for running cPouta and ePouta cloud services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Authentication service provider used for accessing cPouta web interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Authentication service provider used for accessing cPouta web interface)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPOUTA<|>CSC<|>cPouta is a cloud service provided by CSC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPOUTA<|>CSC<|>ePouta is a cloud service provided by CSC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPOUTA<|>OPENSTACK<|>cPouta runs on the OpenStack cloud software<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPOUTA<|>OPENSTACK<|>ePouta runs on the OpenStack cloud software<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPOUTA<|>HAKA<|>cPouta web interface is accessible using Haka authentication<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPOUTA<|>VIRTU<|>cPouta web interface is accessible using Virtu authentication<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
