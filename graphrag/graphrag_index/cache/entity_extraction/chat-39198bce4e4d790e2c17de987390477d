[See the HyperQueue page for more\ndetails](../../apps/hyperqueue.md#sbatch-hq).\n\n## PyTorch 1.13, 9.12.2022\n\nPyTorch 1.13.0 is now available in the `pytorch/1.13` module on Puhti\nand Mahti, and has been set as the default version. See the [PyTorch\n1.13 release blog\npost](https://pytorch.org/blog/PyTorch-1.13-release/), and [CSC's\nPyTorch module documentation](../../apps/pytorch.md).\n\n## Amber22 installed on Puhti, 16.11.2022\n\n[Amber](../../apps/amber.md) version 22 has been installed on Puhti and set as the default\nmodule. [See here for a list of major new features](https://ambermd.org/AmberMD.php).\n\n## Maestro 2022.3 and 2022.4 installed on Puhti, 15.11.2022\n\n[Schrödinger Maestro](../../apps/maestro.md) 2022.3 and 2022.4 have been\ninstalled on Puhti and the latter version set as the default module. [See\nrelease notes here](https://www.schrodinger.com/releases/new-features/).\n\n## CP2K 2022.2, 10.11.2022\n\n[CP2K](../../apps/cp2k.md) 2022.2 has been installed and set as the default module on Puhti\nand Mahti. [See release notes here](https://www.cp2k.org/version_history).\n\n## Gromacs 2022.3, 7.11.2022\n\n[Gromacs](../../apps/gromacs.md) 2022.3 has been installed and set as the default module on Puhti\nand Mahti. [See release notes here](https://manual.gromacs.org/2022.3/release-notes/2022/2022.3.html).\n\n## Installing software with Spack, 28.10.2022\n\nUsers can now install software on CSC supercomputers using the Spack package\nmanager. [See here for a short tutorial on how to use the user Spack module at\nCSC](../tutorials/user-spack.md).\n\n## Installing packages from Bioconda using Tykky, 10.10.2022\n\nA [new tutorial](../tutorials/bioconda-tutorial.md) on how to install packages from the Bioconda\nchannel using the [Tykky container wrapper tool](../../computing/containers/tykky.md) has been\npublished. This tutorial outlines the recommended way to install software packages related to\nbioinformatics and biomedical research. Note that CSC has deprecated the *direct* (non-containerized)\nusage of Conda installations on our supercomputers due to file system performance issues.\n\n## Available applications can now be viewed as grouped by license type, 7.10.2022\n\nIn addition to alphabetical ordering, grouped by discipline or by availability, applications can now be\nviewed as grouped by license type. Some information about each of the license categories is\nprovided. See [Applications by license](../../apps/by_license.md). (The page can also be reached from\nthe side navigation: Applications > By license)\n\n## Python Data 3.10-22.09, 7.10.2022\n\nCoinciding with the Red Hat 8 update of Puhti, a new [Python Data](../../apps/python-data.md)\nmodule has been installed (on both Puhti and Mahti). In addition, old conda-based modules have\nbeen removed, and the naming of modules has changed. Modules are now named according to the Python\nversion (PV) and the year (YY) and month (MM) of the installation, as PV-YY.MM. Typically the\nmodule will include the newest versions of libraries at installation time, to the extent software\ndependencies allow. Modules can also be loaded simply with the Python version, and you will get\nthe most recent installation with that version of Python, for example: `module load python-data/3.9`.\n\n## `r-env-singularity` renamed to `r-env` and update to R 4.2.1 coinciding with RHEL8 update, 14.9.2022\n\nFollowing the RHEL8 update on Puhti, the `r-env-singularity` module has been renamed to\n[`r-env`](../../apps/r-env.md). The R version has been updated to 4.2.1, along with several\nother version updates for installations included in the module. Due to the RHEL8 update requiring\nmodifications to the `r-env` module setup, older R versions are currently unavailable.\n\n## Discovery Studio and Material Studio license discontinued in 2023, 25.8.2022\n\nCSC has been providing a national academic license for [Discovery Studio](../../apps/discovery-studio.md)\nand [Materials Studio](../../apps/materialsstudio.md). Due to small usage and the availability of\noverlapping tools ([Maestro](../../apps/maestro.md)), the license will not be continued after this\nyear.
