Stripe settings can be,\nhowever, changed by user which can at best improve the I/O performance\na lot.\n\nThe stripe settings for a file or directory can be queried with the\n`lfs getstripe` command\n\n```\nlfs getstripe my_file\n```\nwhich prints out:\n```\nmy_file\nlmm_stripe_count:  2\nlmm_stripe_size:   1048576\nlmm_pattern:       raid0\nlmm_layout_gen:    0\nlmm_stripe_offset: 11\n    obdidx         objid        objid         group\n        11      29921659    0x1c8917b             0\n        20      29922615    0x1c89537             0\n\n```\nThe output shows that the file is distributed over two OSTs (stripe\ncount 2), output also shows that the particular OSTs are 11 and 20.\n\nFor a directory, the output shows the settings that will be used for\nany files to be created in the directory.\n\nStripe configuration can be set with the `lfs setstripe` command. In\nmost cases, it is enough to set the stripe count with the `-c`\noption, however, also other options can be set, see e.g. `man\nlfs-setstripe` or [Lustre\nwiki](https://wiki.lustre.org/Configuring_Lustre_File_Striping).\n\n```\nmkdir experiments\nlfs setstripe -c 4 experiments\ntouch experiments/new_file\n```\nExecuting now `lfs getstripe experiments/new_file` outputs:\n```\nexperiments/new_file\nlmm_stripe_count:  4\nlmm_stripe_size:   1048576\nlmm_pattern:       raid0\nlmm_layout_gen:    0\nlmm_stripe_offset: 6\n    obdidx         objid        objid         group\n         6      29925064    0x1c89ec8             0\n         1      29925258    0x1c89f8a             0\n        19      29926834    0x1c8a5b2             0\n        15      29921764    0x1c891e4             0\n\n```\n\n!!!! Note If the file is already created with a specific stripe, you\n     can not change it. Also, if you move a file, its stripe settings will not\n     change. In order to change striping, file needs to be copied:\n\n* using `setstripe`, create a new, empty file with the desired stripe settings\n  and then copy the old file to the new file, or\n* setup a directory with the desired configuration and copy (not move) the\n  file into the directory.\n\n## Differences between Puhti and Mahti\n\nPuhti and Mahti have similar storage areas\n[home](disk.md#home-directory), [project](disk.md#projappl-directory)\nand [scratch](disk.md#scratch-directory), however, their the Lustre\nconfiguration is not the same.\n\n|  Name       | Puhti  |        | Mahti  |        |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|**Disk area** | **# OSTs** | **# MDTs** | **# OSTs** | **# MDTs** |\n| home        |  24    |   4    |    8    |   1    |\n| projappl    |  24    |   4    |    8    |   1    |\n| scratch     |  24    |   4    |   24    |   2    |\n\n\nOne main difference is that for Mahti there are separate MDTs between\n`scratch`, `home`, and `project`, thus the metadata performance does\nnot interfere from the different file systems. Moreover, the `scratch` on\nMahti can have better performance than the other storage areas if your\napplication and the data size is big enough because of more OSTs and MDTs. On\nPuhti, all the OSTs and MDTs are shared across the storage areas, thus the\nperformance should be similar between them.\n\nThe peak I/O performance for Mahti is around to 100 GB/sec for write\nand 115 GB/sec for read. However, this performance was achieved on\ndedicated system with 64 compute nodes, which means around to 1.5\nGB/sec per compute node. If more nodes are used or many jobs do\nsignificant I/O, then you will not achieve 1.5 GB/sec, including also\nthat maybe the I/O pattern of an application is not efficient. The\ncorresponding performance for Puhti is half of that of Mahti.\n\n## Best practices\n\n* If possible, avoid using `ls -l` as the information on ownership and\n  permission metadata is stored on MDTs, the file size metadata is available\n  from OSTs. Use `ls` instead if you do not need the extra information.\n\n* Avoid saving a large number of files in a single directory, better to split\n  in more directories.\n\n* If possible, avoid accessing a large number of small files on Lustre.\n\n* Make sure that the stripe count for small files is 1.\n\n* If an application opens a file for reading, then open the file in read mode\n  only.\n\n* Increase striping count for parallel access, especially on large files:\n    * The striping factor should be a factor of the number of used\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LFS (Lustre File System) commands like `lfs getstripe` and `lfs setstripe` are used to query and set stripe configurations for files and directories to improve I/O performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing system with specific Lustre storage configurations, including 24 OSTs and 4 MDTs for home, projappl, and scratch disk areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a computing system with different Lustre storage configurations from Puhti, including separate MDTs for scratch, home, and project areas, and a peak I/O performance of around 100 GB/sec for write and 115 GB/sec for read)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUSTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lustre is a type of file system used in high-performance computing environments for managing file stripe settings to optimize I/O performance)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>LUSTRE<|>Puhti uses the Lustre file system for its storage areas, with specific configurations for OSTs and MDTs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>LUSTRE<|>Mahti utilizes the Lustre file system with a configuration that includes separate MDTs for different storage areas and aims for high I/O performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LFS<|>LUSTRE<|>LFS commands are specifically designed for managing file and directory stripe settings on Lustre file systems<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
