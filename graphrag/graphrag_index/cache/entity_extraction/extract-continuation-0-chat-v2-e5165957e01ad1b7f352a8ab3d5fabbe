You can now access the data in SD Desktop, a private cloud computing environment. To set up your workspace, you need a CSC account, a CSC project, and service access to SD Desktop. When logging in to SD Desktop, use the same user account/identity provider (CSC account, Haka, or ELXIR login) you have used for SD Apply log in. Next, enter the authentication code received via the mobile app. If you are a new CSC user, check these instructions on [accounts](../../accounts/index.md) and [multi-factor authentication](../../accounts/mfa.md).\n\n[![SD Desktop login](images/apply/desktop_login.png)](images/apply/desktop_login.png)\n\n!!! note\n    If you are a new CSC user, please check these instructions on CSC [accounts](../../accounts/index.md). Check also the [SD Desktop user guide](./sd_desktop.md) and [CSC Sensitive Data Services for Research webpage](https://research.csc.fi/sensitive-data-services-for-research) for more information. \n\n## Step 6: Access the data\n\nOnce you sign in to your virtual Desktop, you can access the data using Data Gateway application. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Data Gateway. You can find the application on your Desktop.\n\n2. Select SD Apply.\n\n3. Add your CSC credentials.\n\n4. Click on *Login* and next click on *Continue*.\n\n5. In the new window, at the end of the page, click on *Create*. The application will create a new folder called Projects accessible from your Desktop or programmatically the terminal. Next, click on *Open folder*.\n\n[![SD Desktop Data Gateway application](images/apply/desktop_gateway.png)](images/apply/desktop_gateway.png)\n\n!!! note\n\n    The Projects folder is available only when the Data Gateway application is open. If you sign out from the application, you will not access the data stored in other Sensitive Data services unless you previously made a full copy of it inside your Desktop. Thus, Data Gateway needs to be open during data processing in streaming mode.\n\n## Step 7: Export your results\n\nOnce your analysis is completed, you can export the results from the computing environment. After that, the data access will be revoked. To get access to the same dataset, you need to start a new application process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SD Desktop is a private cloud computing environment for accessing data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides accounts and project management for accessing SD Desktop and other sensitive data services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA GATEWAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Data Gateway is an application on SD Desktop for accessing and managing data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECTS FOLDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A folder created by Data Gateway for storing projects and data accessible from the desktop or programmatically via the terminal)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>CSC<|>SD Desktop requires a CSC account for login and access<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SD DESKTOP<|>DATA GATEWAY<|>Data Gateway is an application used within SD Desktop to access data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA GATEWAY<|>PROJECTS FOLDER<|>Data Gateway creates the Projects folder for data management<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
