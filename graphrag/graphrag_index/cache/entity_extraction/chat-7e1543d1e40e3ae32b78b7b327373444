The toolbox consists of the components **COSMOtherm**,\n**COSMOconf**, **COSMOplex**, **COSMObase** and **COSMOquick**.\n\n**COSMOtherm** is a command-line/file-driven program which can be run directly from a UNIX or DOS\nshell. It allows for the calculation of any solvent or solvent mixture and solute or solute system\nat variable temperature and pressure. COSMOtherm uses the chemical potentials derived from COSMO-RS\ntheory to compute various equilibrium thermodynamic properties or derived quantities. COSMOtherm\nhas a Graphical User Interface to the command-line program. It allows for the interactive use of\nthe program, i.e. selection of compounds, preparation of property input, program runs and display\nof calculation results.\n\n**COSMOconf** is a flexible toolbox for conformer generation. COSMOconf can be used in combination\nwith the [TURBOMOLE](turbomole.md) package to generate COSMO files for relevant conformations. It\nenables you to use pre-defined procedures that are optimized for the generation of the most\nrelevant conformers for COSMO-RS. COSMOconf can be used through the GUI or from the command-line.\n\n**COSMOplex** is a tool for simulation of self-organizing inhomogeneous systems based on COSMO-RS.\nCOSMOconf can be used through the GUI or from the command-line.\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2024\n\n## License\n\n* You may use the Software exclusively for non-profit research purposes.\n* Only users from academic (i.e. degree-granting) institutes are allowed to use the Software\n\n## Usage\n\n### Use the GUI via your browser\n\nGo to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi/) using a web browser and login using your CSC\nuser account or Haka federation.\n\n1. From there, [launch a Desktop](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md#launching). \n2. Open a `Terminal` and move to a suitable working directory.\n3. Load the COSMO-RS module: `module load cosmors/2024`.\n4. Add the launching icons to the Desktop with the command `setup_cosmodesktop.sh`.\n5. Start for instance `COSMOtherm` by double-clicking its Desktop icon.\n\n### Run it from the command-line\n\nInitialize the COSMO-RS environment:\n\n```bash\nmodule load cosmors/2024\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe latest documentation can be found in the directory `/appl/soft/chem/cosmors/Documentation/` as\nPDF files.\n\nOlder documentation online:\n\n* [BIOVIA COSMOtherm](https://www.3ds.com/support/documentation/resource-library/single/biovia-cosmotherm/) \n* [BIOVIA COSMOconf](https://www.3ds.com/support/documentation/resource-library/single/biovia-cosmoconf/) \n* [BIOVIA COSMOquick](https://www.3ds.com/support/documentation/resource-library/single/biovia-cosmoquick/) \n* [BIOVIA COSMOplex ](https://www.3ds.com/support/documentation/resource-library/single/biovia-cosmoplex/) \n\n## More information\n\n* [COSMO-RS at Dassault Systèmes](https://www.3ds.com/products/biovia/cosmo-rs) \n* [COSMO-RS videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRBPTxPZPfXVPSB46N-Ih1bCwMxOUY3de)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
