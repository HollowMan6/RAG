You can check the job number of your blast job from the directory name. Use this number with `-jobid` option to define the `pb blast` job you wish to reconnect to.\n\n```bash\nblast_clusterrun -jobid some-number\n```\n\n## Using own BLAST databases with pb\n\nThe `pb` program also allows users to do BLAST searches against their own fasta formatted sequence sets. This is done by replacing the `-db` option with option `-dbnuc` (for nucleotides) or `-dbprot` (for proteins). Example:\n\n```bash\npb blastn -dbnuc my_seq_set.fasta -query querys.fasta -out results.out\n```\n\nIf your database is big, building the BLAST indexes may require more than 1 GB of memory (that is the job specific memory limit in Puhti login nodes). In those cases you can submit the job from an interactive batch job (with e.g. 8 GB of memory).\n\n## Using taxonomy to focus the search\n\nThe general purpose NCBI BLAST databases like _NT_ or _NE_ have grown very large, which slows the searches in Puhti. Thus, if you can focus your search to only a subset of these databases it makes the search faster and prevents non-important hits to be reported.\n\nStarting with BLAST+ 2.15.0, the BLAST+ command line applications support\na new feature: they accept non-leaf taxIDs (i.e., those above an organism level,\nsuch as the one for primates). For example to focus the search to only bird sequences \n(Taxonomy ID: 8782) of NR database you could use command\n\n```bash\npb blastp -db nr - query test.fasta -taxids 8782 -out test.res\n```\n\nIf you know that you will use a specific subset of _NR_ or _NT_ databases several times, it is more effective\nto filter this part of sequences out once and then index your own database form the filtered sequences. You can use command `blastdbcmd` to filter out a specific taxonomic group from _NR_ or _NT_ databases.\n\nFor example all bird sequences can be retrieved from _NR_ database with command:\n\n```bash\nblastdbcmd -taxids 8782 -db nr -dbtype prot -out nrbirds.fasta -target_only\n```\n\nThe resulting fasta file can be indexed for BLAST searches with `makeblastdb` command.\n\n```bash\nmakeblastdb -in nrbirds.fasta -dbtype prot\n```\n\nTo use your own database, you must redefine environment variable `BLASTDB` so that it points to the directory where you have the index. For example if the indexes locate in directory `my_blastdb` in the scratch directory of project `project_20012345`, the variable would be set with command:\n\n```bash\nexport BLASTDB=/scrartch/project_20012345/my_blastdb\n```\n\nNow you can use your own database in the BLAST search:\n\n```bash\npb blastp -db nrbirds.fasta - queryquery.fasta -out bird-only-hits.res\n```\n\n## Using genome data from Ensembl with pb\n\n`pb` command can also automatically retrieve a species specific dataset from the Ensembl or Ensembl genomes servers and use the dataset as the search database. This is done by replacing the `-db` option with option `-ensembl_dna` (retrieves the genomic DNA), `-ensembl_cdna` (retrieves the cDNA sequences) or `-ensembl_prot` (retrieves the protein sequences). The latin name of a species or taxonomy index number is given as an argument for the Ensembl options. You should use underscore (`_`) instead of space in the species name.\n\nFor example to compare a set of nucleotide sequences against the human genome, you could use a command like:\n\n```bash\npb blastn -query dna_fargments.fasta -ensembl_dna homo_sapiens -out human_hits.txt\n```\n\nTo compare the same DNA fragments against the protein sequences, predicted from the chicken genome, you could use command:\n\n```bash\npb tblastn -query dna_fargments.fasta -ensembl_prot gallus_gallus -out chicken_hits.txt\n```\n\nYou can see the list of species, available at Ensembl and Ensembl genomes databases with command:\n\n```bash\nensemblfetch.sh -names\n```\n\nBelow is a list of BLAST databases maintained at the servers of CSC.\n\n| **Name          | Database                                             | Source file**                                               |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Nucleotides** |                                                                                               |\n| nt              | NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database               | ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/                      |\n| refseq          | NCBI RefSeq RNA database                             | ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/complete/             |\n| refseq_con      | NCBI RefSeq human contigs                            | ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/H_sapiens/          |\n|                 |                                                      |                                                             |\n| **Proteins**    |                                                      |                                                             |\n| nr              | NCBI non-redundant protein database                  | ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/                      |\n| pdb_v5          | PDB protein structure database                       | ftp://ftp.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/derived_data/                    |\n| swiss           | Uniprot/Swiss database                               | ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledge\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
