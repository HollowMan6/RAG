From its manual:\n\n```bash\n$ oc rsync\nCopy local files to or from a pod container\n\nThis command will copy local files to or from a remote container. It only copies the changed files\nusing the rsync command from your OS. To ensure optimum performance, install rsync locally. In UNIX\nsystems, use your package manager. In Windows, install cwRsync from https://www.itefix.net/cwrsync.\n```\n\nFirst of all, it is required to [install oc](../rahti2/usage/cli.md).\n\nOnce `oc` is installed, the process is:\n\n* Create the `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) to store the data in Rahti 2. You may use the web interface or directly the command line. In this example we will use the command line. A simple way to create a `1Gi` volume called `testing-pvc` is:\n\n```bash\n$ echo 'apiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: testing-pvc\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi' | oc create -f -\n```\n\n* Mount the PVC into a POD with `rsync` installed. It is possible to use any image that has the command `rsync` installed. If you have no access to such an image, `oc rsync` will work also with an image with `tar` installed (`centos` and `ubuntu ` images come with `tar installed).\n\n* Finally, use `oc rsync` to synchronize a local directory with a directory in the pod:\n\n```bash\noc rsync ./local/dir/ POD:/remote/dir\n```\n\nIf the local data changes, you may just run the same command again. If the image has `rsync` installed, only the data that has changed will be copied over to the PVC.\n\n## to Allas object storage\n\nSee [using Allas with Rclone](../../data/Allas/using_allas/rclone.md) for a guide on how to copy the data to Allas. Once the data is in Allas, you can use any *Swift* or *S3* compatible client or library, like `rclone`, to use the data in you application.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
