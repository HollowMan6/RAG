The profiling\ninformation will be written to the standard output.\n\nOther `perftools-lite` modules are available for users seeking information\nother than that provided by the default `perftools-lite` module:\n\n- `perftools-lite-events`: event profile (tracing)\n- `perftools-lite-gpu`: GPU kernel and data movement events profiling\n- `perftools-lite-loops`: loop work estimates\n- `perftools-lite-hbm`: memory profiling\n\nOnce you have them loaded, these modules can be used in the same way as\n`perftools-lite`.\n\n## CrayPat\n\nCrayPat is the full-featured program analysis tool set. The typical workflow is\n\n- use `pat_build` to instrument a program\n- run the instrumented executable\n- use either `pat_report` or Cray Apprentice2 to view the resulting report.\n\n### Sampling\n\nSampling is a statistical profiling. By taking regular snapshots of the\napplications call stack, we can create a statistical profile of where the\napplication spends most of its time.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/sampling.svg\"\n    width=\"450\"\n    alt=\"Sampling of an application\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n    Sampling of an application. Snapshots of the application's call stack are\n    captured at regular intervals to create a statistical profile.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOne of the main advantages of a sampling experiment is the low overhead\nfixed by the choice of sampling rate.\nOn the other hand, sampling is non-deterministic and can only provide a\nstatistical picture of the application behavior.\n\nThe `pat_build` tool is used to instrument your application. The first step to\nuse this tool is to load the `perftools-base` and `perftools` modules and build\nyour application as normal.\n\n```bash\n$ module load perftools-base\n$ module load perftools\n\n$ cc -o app.x source.c\n```\n\nThe second step is to use `pat_build`.\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build app.x\n```\n\nThis command will create a new executable with name `<exec>+pat`. In our\nexample, we will produce `app.x+pat`. The name can be chosen by the user using\nthe `-o <output_exe>` option. The default experiment is a sampling experiment.\n\nThe next step is to run the application. A directory with a name beginning with\nthe name of your application will be created as a result. This directory\ncontains the profiling information gathered during the run. You can change the\nname of this output directory with the `PAT_RT_EXPDIR_NAME` environment\nvariable. For example\n\n```bash\n$ export PAT_RT_EXPDIR_NAME=apa_sample_exp.${SLURM_JOBID}\n$ srun ./app.x+pat\n```\n\nYou can use this directory to generate a more detailed report with the\n`pat_report` command.\n\n```bash\n$ pat_report <perftool-output-dir>\n```\n\n### Tracing\n\nTracing revolves around specific program events like entering or exiting a\nfunction. This allows the collection of accurate information about specific\nareas of the code every time the event occurs. This allows for more accurate\nand detailed information as data is collected from every traced function\ncall, not a statistical average. Tracing may require the program to be\ninstrumented.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/tracing.svg\"\n    width=\"450\"\n    alt=\"Tracing of an application\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n    Instrumentation of an application for tracing. The instrumentation code is\n    inserted so that all events of interest are captured allowing for much more\n    detailed information.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe main downside is that the instrumentation code inserted will be run every\ntime an instrumented function is called to record the information.\nThis may introduce significant profiling overhead.\n\n#### Automatic program analysis (APA)\n\nYou can do a focused tracing experiment based on the results from the [sampling\nexperiment][sampling]. This is achieved by providing `pat_build` with a\n`build-options.apa` file generated with `pat_report` from a previous sampling\nrun.\n\n```bash\n$ pat_build -O <pertools-out-dir>/build-options.apa\n```\n\nThis will build a new executable whose name ends with `+apa`. You can then run\nthis executable to get tracing data and generate a report with `pat_report`.\n\n#### Manual analysis\n\nIf the automatic program\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
