More specifically, the\nfolders are owned by the system administrator account, but the associated\nUnix group has read and write rights. In addition, the set GID\npermission is also enabled so that any new files and folders are owned\nby the project group by default. Note that also the set GID permissions is\ninherited to all new folders.\n\nYou can check the permissions using `ls -l` command. Correct default\npermissions for a subfolder are `drwxrws---`. Note the small `s`\nletter instead of `x` in the group permissions. If you see a capital `S`\ninstead, the directory doesn't have execute permissions which are\nneeded for group-level access.\n\nIf the set GID permission of any subdirectory\nis removed on purpose or by accident, all new files and folders within\nthat subdirectory will be owned by the user's default personal group\nand other group members can't access them. If the access is needed,\nthen the owner of those files and folders should change the group and\nfix the permissions. Note that many tools and installation scripts do\nmodify the default permissions.\n\nExample of missing SGID permission:\n\n```bash\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ mkdir -m 00770 demofolder\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwx---. 2 maijam project_2009999       4096 Feb 15 14:52 demofolder\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ touch demofolder/my-file\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ ls -l demofolder/\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw----. 1 maijam maijam 0 Feb 15 14:52 my-file\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ chmod g+s demofolder/\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ touch demofolder/my-other-file\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ ls -l demofolder/\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw----. 1 maijam maijam          0 Feb 15 14:52 my-file\n-rw-rw----. 1 maijam project_2009999 0 Feb 15 14:53 my-other-file\n```\n\nExample of fixing the permissions:\n\n```bash\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ chgrp -R project_2009999 demofolder/\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ lfs find demofolder -type d -0 | xargs -0 chmod 2770\n[maijam@puhti project_2009999]$ lfs find demofolder -type f -0 | xargs -0 chmod g+rwX\n```\n\nMore about Linux file permissions at RedHat documentation:\n[Linux permissions: SUID, SGID, and sticky bit](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC sets the permissions of project and scratch directories for all project members, ensuring access control and management of directory and file permissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR<|>PERSON<|>The system administrator account owns the folders, with specific permissions set for project and scratch directories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIX GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Unix group associated with project and scratch directories has read and write rights, and new files and folders inherit the group's permissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REDHAT DOCUMENTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides information about Linux file permissions, including SUID, SGID, and sticky bit)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR<|>The CSC uses the system administrator account to manage permissions for project and scratch directories<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>UNIX GROUP<|>CSC sets permissions so that the Unix group has read and write rights to project and scratch directories<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR<|>UNIX GROUP<|>The system administrator account owns the folders, but the Unix group has the actual read and write permissions<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
