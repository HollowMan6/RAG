A bucket is a data object container. Buckets should not be confused with _dockers_ or other computing containers. A bucket functions similarly to a file system directory, except that there can only be one level, i.e. buckets cannot contain other buckets.\n\n![Allas projects and buckets](img/allas_projects_and_buckets.PNG)\n**Figure** Data structure in Allas\n\n## Naming buckets\n\nEach bucket has a name that must be unique across all Allas users. If another user has a bucket called \"_test_\", another bucket called \"_test_\" cannot be created. All bucket names are public, so please do <u>not</u> include any confidential information in the bucket names. You may, for example, use your project ID, e.g. _2000620-raw-data_.\n\nObject URLs can be in the DNS format, e.g. _https://a3s.fi/bucketname/objectname_. Please use a valid DNS name (RFC 1035). We recommend not using upper case or non-ASCII (&auml;, &ouml; etc.) characters.\n\nIt is <u>not</u> possible to rename a bucket.\n\nThe data is spread across various servers, which protects against disk and server failures. **Please note:** This does not protect the data from e.g. accidental deletion. Please make regular backups of important data.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
