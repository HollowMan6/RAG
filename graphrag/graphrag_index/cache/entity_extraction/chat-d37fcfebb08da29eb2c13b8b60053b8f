You can use `s3fs` for that.\n\n### Use s3fs to mount a folder into your VM\n\n\n1. To do this, create first an empty directory (like **os_case_1**) to be used as a mount point:\n\n\t```sh\n\tmkdir os_case_1\n\t```\n\n\t!!! info\n\t    Any empty directory can be used as a mount point\n\n1. Create a `.passwd-s3fs` file in your home directory. The format of the file must be: `ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and have _600_ permissions. (Your project must be sourced: `source project_xxxxxxx`)\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ openstack ec2 credentials list -f value | grep $OS_PROJECT_ID | tail -1 |\\\n\t   awk '{print $1\":\"$2}' >.passwd-s3fs\n\tPassword:\n\t$ chmod 600 .passwd-s3fs\n\t```\n\n1. then use the _s3fs_ command to mount the bucket.\n\n\t```sh\n\ts3fs case_1 os_case_1 -o passwd_file=~/.passwd-s3fs -o url=https://a3s.fi/ \\\n\t\t-o use_path_request_style -o umask=0333,uid=$(id -u)\n\t```\n\n\t!!! info \n\t    The uid value returned by `id -u` should be 1000 for the default user\n\n\t!!! info\n\t    The umask value `0333` mounts the files in **read-only mode**. If you want to mount them in read-write mode, use `0027` instead\n\n1. And after this you should be able to see the objects of the mounted bucket as files. Try for example the command:\n\n\t```sh\n\tls -l os_case_1\n\t```\n\n\tThe output should be the same as with `s3cmd ls s3://case_1`\n\n\t!!! info \n\t    You can also check the mount by typing the command `df -h`\n\n1. When you are done you can unmount the folder by:\n\n\t```sh\n\tsudo umount os_case_1\n\t```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
