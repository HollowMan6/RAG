Thus, you can use `scp` to transport data between CSC\nand your local computer, or between different file systems at CSC.\n\nThe basic syntax for copying data from a local machine to a remote server is:\n\n```bash\nscp /path/to/file username@server:/path/to/remote/destination\n```\n\nAnd correspondingly the syntax to copy files from a remote server to a local\nmachine is:\n\n```bash\nscp username@server:/path/to/file /path/to/local/destination\n```\n\nFor example, the command to copy a local file `data.txt` from the current\ndirectory to the home directory of user `bob` on Puhti would be:\n\n```bash\nscp data.txt bob@puhti.csc.fi:~/\n```\n\nThe special symbol `~` points to the user's home directory. You can use the\n`csc-workspaces` command on Puhti to show other available disk areas.\n\nTo copy complete directories, you should use `scp` command with option `-r`.\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nscp -r /path/to/data_directory bob@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_2001234/data_dir \n```\n\nThe above command would copy the directory `data_directory` and all its\ncontents to Puhti at `/scratch/project_2001234/data_dir`.\n\nCopying the data from a CSC server to your local machine is done in the same\nway:\n\n```bash\nscp bob@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_2001234/data.txt .\n```\n\nThe `.` symbol points to the current working directory on your local machine,\ni.e. the location where you're running the `scp` command.\n\nIn the commands above, files and directories have been copied one at a time.\nHowever, `scp` can also copy several files at once. For example:\n\n```bash\nscp data1.txt data2.txt data3.txt bob@puhti.csc.fi:~/\n```\n\nYou can also use wildcards when defining the files to be copied. For example,\nto copy all files with extension `.txt` from the current directory on your\nlocal machine to your home directory on Puhti, you could use the command:\n\n```bash\nscp *.txt bob@puhti.csc.fi:~/\n```\n\nBy default, the copied files are treated as new files, but if you add option\n`-p` to the `scp` command, then the copied file will inherit the timestamp and\naccess mode information from the original file.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SCP is a command used for copying files between different machines, including Linux, macOS, and Windows systems, and is utilized for transferring data between CSC and local computers or between different file systems at CSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC refers to a computing center or service where users can transfer data to and from using the scp command)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a server or computing resource at CSC to which users can copy files using the scp command)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCP<|>CSC<|>SCP is used for transferring data to and from CSC, indicating a functional relationship between the command and the computing center<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCP<|>PUHTI<|>SCP is specifically mentioned for use in copying files to and from Puhti, showing its application in interacting with this CSC resource<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti is a part of CSC's computing resources, indicating an organizational relationship<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
