You can freely choose the label after `Host` (`puhti-software-environment`) and this is how it will appear in the remote host selection of the VS Code Remote SSH extension when you make a connection. We recommend giving each combination of system and software environment you work with a recongnizable name (e.g., `puhti-pytorch`).\n\n   If you prefer to use an SSH key instead of being prompted for your password, you can add `IdentityFile <path_to_your_keyfile>` to the host configuration block shown above (this is mandatory for LUMI).\n\n#### Loading CSC modules\n\nYou can load a module into the VS Code remote connection using the following `remote_command`:\n\n```bash -c \"source /appl/profile/zz-csc-env.sh; module load <your_module>; singularity_wrapper shell\"```\n\nOn LUMI, you will instead need to use\n\n```module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles/; module load <your_module>; singularity_wrapper shell```\n\n`<your_module>` is the module (or modules) you want to load, e.g. `pytorch`.\n\n!!! note\n\n    The `singularity_wrapper shell` part of the above `remote_command` assumes that the module is built using a singularity container,\n    which is true in the majority of cases. However, if this does not work, try to replace it with `bash`.\n\n#### Loading CSC modules with additional packages (Python)\n\nIf your environment is based on a CSC module but you have installed some additional packages on top either via `venv` or using `pip install --user` (see also our [Python usage guide](python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules)) you will need to use the following `remote_command` (on Puhti/Mahti):\n\n- `pip` installation to custom `PYTHONUSERBASE`: insert `export PYTHONUSERBASE=<your_pip_user_base_dir>; ` before `singularity_wrapper shell`, i.e. on Puhti/Mahti the `remote_command` becomes: ```bash -c \"source /appl/profile/zz-csc-env.sh; module load <your_module>; export PYTHONUSERBASE=<your_pip_user_base_dir>;  singularity_wrapper shell\"```\n- `venv`: insert `export APPTAINERENV_PREPEND_PATH='<your_venv_dir>/bin/'` before `singularity_wrapper shell` - you may also have to [select the Python interpreter used by VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment) as the one provided by the venv\n\n\n!!! note\n\n    Unfortunately the support for venv is currently limited to environments that are set-up from within the singularity container. To set up the venv, do the following in the system terminal:\n    1. Load the respective (base) module: `module load <your_module>`\n    2. Enter the container environment: `singularity_wrapper shell`\n    3. Create the virtual environment: `python -m venv --system-site-packages <path_where_to_create_the_venv_directory>`\n\n    Step 2 is crucial - if you create the venv from outside the container, it will not work from within and therefore not with the VS Code remote setup described above.\n\n#### Loading tykky containers (Python)\n\nTo connect to a custom Python environment container created with our [Tykky container wrapper](../../computing/containers/tykky.md), use the following `remote_command`:\n\n```<tykky_installation_dir>/bin/_debug_shell```\n\nwhere `<tykky_installation_dir>` is the path in which the Tykky environment installation was made.\n\nOnce you are connected to the remote environment in VS Code, the integrated terminal should show as prompt line\n\n```bash\nApptainer>\n```\n\nindicating that you have a shell inside the Tykky container.\n\nFinally, you need to [select the Python interpreter used by VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment) as `/<SYSTEM>_TYKKY_*/miniconda/envs/env1/bin/python`, where `<SYSTEM>` is a placeholder for `PUHTI`, `MAHTI`, `LUMI`, and `*` for some string of random characters.\n\n![Selecting the Python interpreter in VS Code for tykky container environments](../../img/VSCode_select_interpreter_tykky.png)\n\n!!! note\n\n        You will not be able to modify the contents of the container using this VS Code remote connection, including installing new packages via pip or conda. Please modify the container using the [instructions for tykky](../../computing/containers/tykky.md#modifying-a-conda-installation) outside the configured VS Code remote connection.\n\n### Running the code\n\nYou can also run the code in Puhti by opening a terminal from the Terminal tab or using VS Code's debuggers. Note that this runs the code on a login node by default which is __not meant for demanding computations__. Unfortunately it is currently not possible to easily start interactive slurm sessions on computation nodes using the above VS Code remote setup for the majority of modules since the slurm commands are not available from within the singularity containers. Please contact servicedesk@csc.fi if you require help on this.\n\n## Notepad++ with NppFTP plugin\n\nNotepad++ with [NppFTP plugin](https://ashkulz.github.io/NppFTP/) enables viewing and editing remote files.
