We specify that we want to run one task (--ntask=1) in one node\n(--nodes=1) using 16 cores (--cpus-per-task):\n\n```text\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n```\n\nBecause it is a shared memory application we can use `--mem` to specify\nthe total memory requested for the task. For an MPI job we would have\nto request memory per core with `--mem-per-cpu`.\n\n```text\n#SBATCH --mem=16G\n```\n\nThe time reservation is given as hours:minutes:seconds *i.e.* `hh:mm:ss`. in\nthis case we reserve four hours:\n\n```text\n#SBATCH --time=04:00:00\n```\n\nWe also need to specify which partition (also called a queue) we want \nthe job to run in. This is specified with the `--partition` option. For \nmost bioscience jobs \"small\" is the correct choice. It is for jobs that\nrun inside one node.\n\n```text\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n```\n\nYou can check the available partitions in the User Guide: [Available\nbatch job partitions](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md)\n\nBy default various outputs and error messages that would be printed to\nthe screen if the application was run interactively, are saved in a\nfile called *slurm-&lt;jobid&gt;.out*. Sometimes it is clearer to separate\nthe outputs and errors. This can be done adding options `--output` and\n`--error`. The `%j` will be replaced by jobid of the job in the file name.\n\n```text\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n```\n\nThere are also other available options. For a more detailed\nexplanation, please see the User Guide: [Creating a batch job script\nfor Puhti](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md)\n\nWhen you have written the batch job script, you can submit the job to the queue:\n```text\nsbatch myjobscript\n```\nIf the job was submitted successfully, you should see a message:\n```text\nSubmitted batch job <jobid>\n```\n\nIt is possible to launch a job directly with command **srun** by\ngiving the options given as `#SBATCH` lines directly as command line\noptions, but writing a batch job script is generally preferable for\nclarity and ease of re-use if you *e.g.* want submit a similar job with\ndifferent data or modified parameters.\n\n### Array jobs\n\nIf you wish to run several instances of the same command with different \ninput files or different set of parameters, you should consider running \nthem as an array job. Array jobs offer an easy way to launch and manage \na group of similar jobs.\n\nRunning array jobs is described in detail in the User Guide: \n[Array jobs](../../computing/running/array-jobs.md)\n\n## Managing jobs\n\nYou can check your current jobs, both running and queueing:\n```text\nsqueue -u <username>\n```\nOr  get a bit more detailed listing using:\n```text\nsqueue -l -u <username>\n```\nYou can check the status of your job in the column named ST or STATUS (depending\nwhether option -l is used or not). R or RUNNING means the job is currently running.\nP or PENDING means it is still waiting in the queue.\n\nIf the job is pending, you can see the reason in the NODELIST(REASON) column. \n\nReason:\n```text\n(Resources)\n```\nor\n```text\n (Nodes required for job are DOWN, DRAINED or reserved for jobs in higher priority partitions)\n```\nmean that there are currently no available resources to run your job. The\njob will run as soon as resources are free.\n\nReason:\n```text\n(Priority)\n```\nmeans your job is being held back by the fair share functionality of the \nbatch job system: When a user runs many jobs in a short amount of time, their \njobs will have lower priority. These jobs will spend a bit longer in the queue, \nbut will be run eventually.\n\nQueueing time will depend on the overall load on the system (*i.e.* how many jobs are in the \nqueue before yours) and on the resource requirements of your jobs.\n\nIf it feels your jobs queue a long time, you might want to check this FAQ entry:\n[Why is my batch job queueing so long?](../faq/why-is-my-job-queueing-so-long.md)\n\nThere are also other reasons, but they are less common. Consult **servicedesk@csc.fi** if necessary.\n\nYou can cancel a submitted batch job with:\n```text\nscancel <jobid>\n```\n\n## Monitoring resource usage\n\nAfter the job has finished you can use commands **seff** and **sacct** to check the \nresources the job actually used.\n```text\nseff <jobid>\n```\n\nMost important things to check are the CPU efficiency and memory utilization.\n\nThere are many things that can cause poor CPU efficiency. It could, for example,\nindicate that the program is waiting for disk access to catch up. In these cases\nyou should consider using a node with fast local disk.  For details, please see the User Guide: \n[Creating a batch job script for Puhti](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md)\n\nLow efficiency could also be due to reserving more than one core and the application\nscaling poorly. Check especially if the percentage matches the number of cores reserved,\n*e.g.* 25% with\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SBATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SBATCH is a command used in scripting for submitting jobs to a queue in a computing environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is referenced as a computing environment for which batch job scripts are created)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SLURM is a workload manager used for submitting jobs, mentioned in the context of output and error file naming)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SBATCH<|>PUHTI<|>SBATCH commands are used for creating batch job scripts specifically for the Puhti computing environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SBATCH<|>SLURM<|>SBATCH is part of the SLURM workload manager's syntax for job submission<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
