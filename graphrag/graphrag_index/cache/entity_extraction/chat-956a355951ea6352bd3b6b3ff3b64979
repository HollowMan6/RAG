To \n        access the extension you must load one of the following \n        modules. Note that any module names in parentheses show the \n        module location in the software hierarchy.\n\n           buildtools/23.09 (LUMI/23.09 partition/L)\n           buildtools/23.09 (LUMI/23.09 partition/G)\n           buildtools/23.09 (LUMI/23.09 partition/C)\n           buildtools/23.09 (CrayEnv)\n    ```\n    This tells that `CMake` is provided by the `buildtools/23.09` module and also \n    indicates four possible combinations of software stack modules that can provide\n    that module.\n\n\n### module keyword\n\nAnother search command that is sometimes useful is `module keyword`. It \njust searches for the given word in the short descriptions that are included in\nmost module files and in the name of the module. The output is not always\ncomplete since not all modules may have a complete enough short description.\n\nConsider we are looking for a library or package that supports MP3 audio\nencoding.\n\n```bash\n$ module keyword mp3\n```\n\nwill return something along the lines of\n\n```text\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following modules match your search criteria: \"mp3\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  LAME: LAME/3.100-cpeAMD-22.08, LAME/3.100-cpeAMD-22.12, ...\n    LAME is a high quality MPEG Audio Layer III (mp3) encoder\n```\n\nthough the output will depend on the version of Lmod. This may not be the most\nuseful example on a supercomputer, but the library is in fact needed to be able\nto install some other packages even though the sound function is not immediately\nuseful.\n\n### module avail\n\nThe `module avail` command is used to show only available modules, i.e., modules\nthat can be loaded directly without first loading other modules. It can be used\nin two ways:\n\n 1. Without a further argument, it will show an often lengthy list of all\n    available modules. Some modules will be marked with `(D)` which means that\n    they are the default module that would be loaded should you load the module\n    using only its name.\n\n 2. With the name of a module (or a part of the name), it will show all modules\n    that match that (part of) a name. E.g., when `LUMI/22.12` is loaded,\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module avail gnuplot\n    ```\n\n    will show something along the lines of\n\n    ```text\n    ----- EasyBuild managed software for software stack LUMI/22.12 on LUMI-L -----\n       gnuplot/5.4.6-cpeAOCC-22.12    gnuplot/5.4.6-cpeGNU-22.12 (D)\n       gnuplot/5.4.6-cpeCray-22.12\n\n      Where:\n       D:  Default Module\n    ```\n\n    but\n\n    ```bash\n    $ module avail gnu\n    ```\n\n    will show you an often lengthy list that contains all packages with gnu\n    (case-insensitive) in their name or version.\n\n## Getting help\n\nOne way to get help on a particular module has already been discussed on this\npage: `module spider <name>/<version>` will produce help about the package as\nsoon as it can unambiguously determine the package. It is the only command that\ncan produce help for all installed packages. The next two commands can only\nproduce help about available packages.\n\nA second command is `module whatis` with the name or name and version of a\nmodule. It will show the brief description of the module that is included in\nmost modules on the system. If the full version of the module is not given, it\nwill display the information for the default version of that module.\n\nThe third command is `module help`. Without any further argument, it will display\nbrief help about the module command.\nHowever, when used as `module help <name>` or `module help <name>/<version>`,\nit will produce help for either the default version of the package\n(if the version is not specified) or the indicated version.\n\n## Loading and unloading modules\n\nLoading and unloading modules in Lmod is very similar to other module systems.\nAlso, note that only *available* modules can be loaded with the commands below.\nSome *installed* modules may only become *available* after first loading other\nmodules as discussed above.\n\nTo load a module, use the `module load` command. For example, to load the Cray\nFFTW library, use:\n\n```bash\n$ module load cray-fftw\n```\n\nThis command will load the default version of the module. If the software you\nloaded has dependencies, they will be loaded in your environment at the same\ntime.\n\nTo load a specific version of the module, you need to specify it after the name\nof the module:\n\n```bash\n$ module load cray-fftw/3.3.10.5\n```\n\nTo unload a module from your environment, use the `unload` sub-command\nfollowed by the name of the module you want to remove.\n\n``\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
