The default size of a page is 4KB.\nCPUs have a built-in memory management unit that manages a list of these pages\nin hardware. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a small hardware cache\nof virtual-to-physical page mappings. If the virtual address passed in a\nhardware instruction can be found in the TLB, the mapping can be determined\nquickly. If not, a TLB miss occurs, and the system falls back to slower,\nsoftware-based address translation, resulting in performance issues.\n\n## Reasons to use hugepages\n\nSince the size of the TLB is fixed in the hardware, a way to reduce the chance\nof a TLB miss is to increase the page size. Using very large page sizes can\nimprove system performance by reducing the amount of system resources required\nto access page table entries by reducing the number of virtual to physical\naddress translations.\n\nHugepages can be beneficial\n\n- for MPI applications, map the static data and/or heap onto huge pages\n- for applications using shared memory that are concurrently registered with\n  high-speed network drivers for remote communication\n- to improve memory performance for common access patterns on large data sets\n- for applications doing heavy I/O\n- for SHMEM applications, map the static data and/or private heap onto huge\n  pages\n- for applications written in Unified Parallel C and other languages based on\n  the PGAS programming model, to map the static data and/or private heap onto\n  huge pages\n\n## How to use hugepages\n\nTo use hugepages load the module corresponding to the page size you wish to\nuse. For example, to use a page size of 2 megabytes:\n\n```bash\n$ module load craype-hugepages2M\n```\n\nFor x86 processors, which is the architecture of the LUMI CPUs, the supported\npage sizes are 4KB, 2MB and 1GB. Once the module is loaded, you can compile\nyour application as usual using the compiler wrappers.\n\n=== \"C\"\n\n    ```bash\n    cc -o myprogram source.c\n    ```\n\n=== \"C++\"\n\n    ```bash\n    CC -o myprogram source.cpp\n    ```\n\n=== \"Fortran\"\n\n    ```bash\n    ftn -o myprogram source.f90\n    ```\n\nThe `hugepages` module should also be loaded in your job script when running\nyour application.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH ...\n\nmodule load craype-hugepages2M\n\nsrun ./myprogram\n```\n\nIf you execute multiple applications in your job, but only some of them can\nbenefit from using hugepages, export the `HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE` environment\nvariable in your job script to limit the usage of hugepages only to certain\napplications.\n\n```bash\nexport HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE=myprogram1:myprogram2\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
