It is important to note that even if Pouta uses the same command-line it does not mean that you are connected to Pouta. This is especially important if you are automating things in both Pouta and DBaaS since you need to connect to different Keystone endpoints.\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. First make sure that you have `python3` installed.\n2. Then, install the command-line tools:\n\n\t```sh\n\tpip3 install python-openstackclient python-troveclient\n\t```\n\n3. You need to download your `openrc` file from [Pukki](https://pukki.dbaas.csc.fi) and choose the correct project number. Then, go to `API Access` and `Download OpenStack RC file` and choose `OpenStack RC file`.\n4. Once you have downloaded the file you can source it by running:\n\n\t```sh\n\tsource $FILENAME\n\t```\n\n5. After that you should be able to verify that it works by listing available datastores (available types of databases):\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack datastore list\n\t```\n\nRemember that you can use the help command as `openstack help database` and the flag `--help` to find out more about the different commands.\n\n## Creating a database instance\n\n1. Make sure that you have sourced the openrc file that you downloaded from [Pukki](https://pukki.dbaas.csc.fi).\n2. Before creating a database it is a good idea to know what kind of settings you want to use. These are the main things that you want to collect:\n\t* The `name` of your new database instance. In this example we will use `my_database_instance`.\n\t* What `databases` you want to create. In this example we will just use `my_first_database`.\n\t* `IP addresses` from where you would like to access your database. You can usually find out your IP by googling what is my IP or using a homepage like this from CLI:\n\n\t\t```sh\n\t\tcurl ifconfig.me\n\t\t```\n\n\t* `Flavor`, for example `standard.small` . You can list available flavors with:\n\n\t\t```sh\n\t\topenstack database flavor list\n\t\t```\n\n\t* `Datastore`, suggestion: `postgresql`. You can find datastores with:\n\n\t\t```sh\n\t\topenstack datastore list\n\t\t```\n\n\t* `datastore version`. This depends on the datastore you have chosen and you should usually choose the latest. If you use PostgreSQL you can probably use `14.5`. You can find out the available datastore versions with:\n\n\t\t```sh\n\t\topenstack datastore version list postgresql\n\t\t```\n\n\t* How large `volume` in GiB you want to use to store your database. If this is your first time testing DBaaS you will get by with `1` GiB.\n\n\t* What `username` and `password` you want to use. In this example we will use `databaseuser` and `myPassword568`.\n\n3. Once you've gathered the data you want to use to create your database you can do it by running the following command. Please update the variables how you see fit, especially `MY_IP`. You can also use the flag `--allowed-cidr` multiple times to add multiple IP-addresses. By default the database instance are created without any `allowed-cidr` which means that you won't be able to connect to your database.\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack database instance create my_database_instance \\\n\t--flavor standard.small \\\n\t--databases my_first_database \\\n\t--users databaseuser:myPassword568 \\\n\t--datastore postgresql \\\n\t--datastore-version 14.5 \\\n\t--is-public \\\n\t--size 1 \\\n\t--allowed-cidr ${MY_IP}/32\n\t```\n\n\tIf you have any issues don't hesitate using the `openstack database instance create --help` command.\n\n4. Now you need to wait a couple of minutes until the database instances have been created and received a public IP. Once the instances have received a `HEALTHY` state the public IP should be visible. Note that it will show you a private and public IP, you are only interested in the public IP. The following command will show you info about the instance:\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack database instance show $INSTANCE_ID\n\t```\n\n5. If you are not happy with the firewalls (`--allowed-cidr`) you can update them with:\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack database instance update $INSTANCE_ID --allowed-cidr $NEW_IP_RANGE\n\t```\n\nIt is a good idea to check out what the command options are with `openstack database instance update --help`.\n\nMore information about how to connect to databases can be found in the `Databases` section in the left hand side navigation.\n\n### Restoring from backups\n\nYou can use the same command as when creating a backup, but you need to use the flag and the backup id you want to use for restoring the backup, `--backup $BACKUP_ID`.\n\n###  Additional useful commands\n\n#### Create additional database in database instance\n\nThis is similar to do a `CREATE DATABASE db_name;`\n\n```\nopenstack database db create $INSTANCE_ID $DB_NAME\n```\n\n#### Adding users to a database\n\nList existing users in the database:\n\n```\nopenstack database user list $INSTANCE_ID\n```\n\nCreate a new user (`--databases` is optional):\n\n```\nopenstack database user create $INSTANCE_ID $USER_NAME $PASSWORD --databases\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
