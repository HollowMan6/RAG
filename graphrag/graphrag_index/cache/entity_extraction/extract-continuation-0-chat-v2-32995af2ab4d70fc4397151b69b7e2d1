The data that needs to be stored for a longer time than just few weeks should be copied to Allas object storage service. \n\nAllas provides a platform that you can use to store your data as long as your CSC project is active. \nIn addition to storing, Allas can be used for transporting data between different servers and sharing data\nwith other users.\n\n## Getting access to Allas\n\nBy default, CSC computing projects do not have access to Allas. Thus, the first thing is to make sure that your project has access to Allas.\nThis can be done in the [MyCSC interface](https://my.csc.fi). Note that only the project manager can \nadd new services for a project. Once Allas access is activated, all project members must visit the MyCSC and accept the terms \nof use for Allas before they can use the Allas storage area.\n\nThe default storage quota in Allas is 10 TB. As this space is shared with all project members, it is\npossible that the space is not sufficient. In that case, you should estimate how much space is needed \nand request more space. The request should be sent to servicedesk@csc.fi.\n\n## Connecting Allas \n\nIn order to use Allas in Puhti or Mahti, first load the module _allas_:\n```text\nmodule load allas\n```\nAllas access for a specific project can then be enabled with command:\n```text\nallas-conf\n```\nor \n```text\nallas-conf project_name\n```\nThe _allas-conf_ command prompts for your CSC password. It lists your Allas projects and asks you to define a project (if not already defined as an argument). After that _allas-conf_ generates configuration files for several Allas clients and authenticates connection to Allas for the selected project. \n\nBy default the _allas-conf_ activates tools that use Allas with **swift protocol**. \nYou can alternatively use S3 protocol too, however in this document we \ndiscuss only _swift_ based Allas usage. \n\nAuthentication is session specific and valid for eight hours at a time.\nYou can be connected to only one Allas project at a time in one terminal session. However, simutaneous terminal sessions\ncan use different Allas projects. The project you are using in Allas does not need to match the project you are using in \nPuhti or Mahti. You can refresh the authentication or change the target project at any time my running _allas-conf_ again. \n\n\n**Allas client software options for Puhti and Mahti and other linux servers**\n\nThe _allas_ module provides several tools that you can use to move data between Allas and the computing server.\nYou can cross-use the Allas clients as long as you access Allas with the same protocol (swift or S3).\nBelow is a list of the Allas clients that are most commonly used in Puhti and Mahti:\n\n* **a-commands:** (Swift, optionally S3) [Easy and safe: a-commands](../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md)\n* **rclone:** (Swift, optionally S3) [Advanced tool: rclone](../data/Allas/using_allas/rclone.md)\n* **swift python client:** (Swift) [Native Swift client](../data/Allas/using_allas/swift_client.md)\n* **s3cmd:** (S3) [S3 client](../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md#configuring-s3-connection-in-supercomputers)\n\nMore information about using Allas can be found from the Allas documentation:\n\n* [Allas](../data/Allas/index.md)\n\nThe Allas documentation includes two tutorials that are especially designed for Puhti and Mahti users:\n\n* [Examples for using Allas in CSC supercomputers](../data/Allas/allas-examples.md)\n\n* [Using Allas in batch jobs](../data/Allas/allas_batchjobs.md)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTING ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides supercomputing resources like Puhti and Mahti and offers the Allas object storage service for long-term data storage)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of CSC's supercomputers, not intended for long-term data storage)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another supercomputer provided by CSC, also not intended for long-term data storage)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage platform provided by CSC for storing data long-term, supports data transport and sharing)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCSC INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Online interface for managing CSC computing projects and services, including Allas access)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTING ENVIRONMENT<|>Puhti is a supercomputer provided by the CSC Supercomputing Environment<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTING ENVIRONMENT<|>Mahti is a supercomputer provided by the CSC Supercomputing Environment<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTING ENVIRONMENT<|>Allas is a service offered by CSC for long-term data storage<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYCSC INTERFACE<|>ALLAS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE<|>MyCSC interface is used to manage access to the Allas Object Storage Service<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE<|>Data from Puhti can be stored in Allas for long-term storage<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>ALLAS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE<|>Data from Mahti can be stored in Allas for long-term storage<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
