It's straightforward to copy data from a directory to Allas.\n  - Flexibility: You can select specific files or directories within the mount to copy to Allas and ideal for small size files.\n\nCons:\n\n  - Performance: This method can be slower, especially if the volume has a large number files.\n\n!!! Warning \"Storage performance\"\n    There are several things to take into account when using Allas regarding performance:\n\n    - Small io kill storage performance. Given the same total size, a single big file will be faster than a bunch of small ones. A solution might be to collect all the small files into one archive file, like a `tar` file.\n    - As the storage pool is shared, latency might vary. Shared hardware means shared performance among different users.\n    - Single threaded io is slow, it is advisable to use multi threaded io when possible.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a storage solution that allows for the copying of data from directories, ideal for small size files, with considerations for performance and storage efficiency)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>SMALL IO<|>Small io operations can negatively impact storage performance in Allas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>SINGLE THREADED IO<|>Single threaded io operations are slow on Allas, suggesting the use of multi threaded io<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>TAR FILE<|>Collecting small files into a tar file is suggested as a solution for improving performance in Allas<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
