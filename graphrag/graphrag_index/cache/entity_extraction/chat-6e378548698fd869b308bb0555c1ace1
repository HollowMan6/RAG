However, please always consult the [application specific\npage](../../apps/index.md) if it exists. It may have a tailored template for you.\n\n## Get the exercise files\n### a) Log in to Puhti from a terminal\n\n`ssh your-username@puhti.csc.fi` or if you don't have an ssh client available, you can log in via the [Puhti web interface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md) using your web browser and open a terminal there.\n\n### b) Go to scratch directory and download the exercises file\n\n`csc-workspaces` command will show you which projects you're a member of.\n```\ncsc-workspaces\n...\nProject: project_20001234 \"Great science with HPC tools\"\n\n/projappl/project_20001234        16G/54G         38K/100K\n/scratch/project_20001234         56G/1.1T       107K/1.0M\n------------------------------------------------------------\n```\nMake note of the project name (here: _project_20001234_). Select the one you want \nto work with and change to the scratch directory (don't work in the `$HOME` folder!):\n\n```\ncd /scratch/project_20001234\n```\n\nand download the input files with `wget`:\n\n```\nwget https://a3s.fi/docs-files/input-data.tar\n```\n\n### c) Uncompress the exercises file\n\n```\ntar xvf input-data.tar\n``` \n\n!!! Note\n    Text in *italics* is not a command and\n    you can choose what to put there (but you need to be consistent later).\n\n## A simple batch job script\n\n### a) Create a batch job script that prints the compute node on which it is running.\n\nUsing nano editor (use whichever editor you like):\n\n```\nnano test_hostname.sh\n```\n\nPut this into the file.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=print_hostname\n#SBATCH --time=00:01:00\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G\n#SBATCH --account=project_20001234\n\nsleep 30\necho \"This job runs on the host: \"; hostname\n```\n\nTo exit from the nano editor:\n\n`CTRL+O (enter); CTRL+X (confirm save)`\n\nSubmit the batch script to Puhti\n\n```\nsbatch test_hostname.sh\n```\n\n### b) Check the job status.\n\nIn the following command replace _<your username\\>_ with your\nCSC username - or which ever you used to log in to Puhti. If\nyou are not sure which it is, you can check it with `whoami` or with\nthis command `echo $USER`).\n\n```\nsqueue -u your_username\n```\n\n### c) What and where did the job print out?\n\n!!! Note \n    Here you need to replace the *JOBID* with the ID your job was given.\n\n```\nless slurm-JOBID.out (type q to quit)\n```\n\nIf the job failed, please check which project you had in the batch script `--account=???`\n[Typical reasons for a failed batch in our FAQ](../faq/why-does-my-batch-job-fail.md)\n\n##Simple R job \n\nRun a simple R job from a script. The script will fit a straight line\nthrough a file containing some x,y value pairs. More info on\n[running R in the CSC environment](../../apps/r-env.md)\n\n### a) Set up an interactive batch job and initialize R environment\n\nAs we now plan to run an application interactively, we'll ask for an interactive\nbatch job and work there, instead of the login node. The following\ncommand will set it up (use the same _project_ as in the batch script above):\n\n```\nsinteractive --account <project> --mem 4000 --tmp 10 --time 2:00:00\n```\n\nGive `module load r-env` to initialize the R environment.\n\n- **How do you know if it is already loaded?**\n\nGo to the directory `r-job`, where you have the data (a file called\n`data.csv`) and launch R:\n\n```\nstart-r\n```\n\nYou should get some introductory text and your prompt should now look like this:\n\n\n```\n...\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\nType 'q()' to quit R.\n\n>\n```\nNow, interactively, fit a line through data points in the file _data.csv_.\nWrite (or copy/paste) the following commands in the prompt (press enter after each line,\nwatch for errors):\n```\nmydata <- read.csv(\"data.csv\")\nfit <- lm(y~x,mydata)\nfit$coefficients\n```\nYou should see something like this:\n```\n(Intercept)           x\n  0.8289352   3.1440282\n```\nThen quit from the R-command prompt with\n```\nq()\n```\n\n### b) Create a script to run the same works.\n\nIn the \"r-job\" directory, create an R script file (R\ncommands to be executed) with the same commands as you pasted\nin the R command prompt. Name the file `fit.R`\n\nYou can use e.g. `nano` editor, which you need to initialize first\nwith `module load nano`\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
