In fact, experience has shown\nthat we may have to remove a stack after a year or so.\n\nThe next block, titled *Modify the module display style*, contains several\nmodules that can be used to change the way the module tree is displayed:\n\n-   `ModuleColour`: these modules can be used to turn the color on or off in\n    the module display.\n-   `ModuleLabel`: change the way the modules are subdivided in blocks and the\n    way those blocks are presented.\n-   `ModuleLabel/label` is the default and will collapse related groups\n    of modules in single blocks, including the Cray PE modules.\n-   `ModuleLabel/PEhierarchy`: will still use the user-friendly style of\n    labeling but will show the complete hierarchy in the modules of the Cray\n    PE.\n-   `ModuleLabel/system`: does not use the user-friendly label texts, but shows\n    the path of the module directory instead.\n-   `ModulePowerUser`: will also reveal several hidden modules, most of which\n    are only important to sysadmins or users who really want to do EasyBuild\n    development in a clone of the software stack.\n-   `ModuleExtensions/hide` and `ModuleExtensions/show` are used to hide or show\n    the module extensions at the end of the overview of `module avail`.\n\n### CrayEnv\n\nLoading `CrayEnv` will essentially give you the default [Cray environment](https://cpe.ext.hpe.com/docs/#hpe-cray-user-environment)\nenriched with several additional tools. The `CrayEnv` module will try to detect\nthe node type of LUMI it is running on and load an appropriate set of target\narchitecture modules to configure the Cray PE (see the documentation page on\n[the programming environment][prgenv] in the Development section). Executing a\n`module purge` while working in the `CrayEnv` environment will automatically\nreload that module and restore the target architecture modules to a set\nsuitable for the node type you are working on.\n\n### LUMI\n\n`LUMI` is our main software stack, managed mostly with [EasyBuild][easybuild].\nIt contains software build with the system compiler and the `PrgEnv-gnu`,\n`PrgEnv-cray`, `PrgEnv-aocc` and `PrgEnv-amd` programming environments, which\nincludes Cray MPI and the Cray scientific libraries. As mixing compiler\nversions and library versions is dangerous, the stack is organized in versions\nthat correspond to the version of the Cray PE used to compile the software.\nSome versions may have the extension `.dev` which denotes that they are highly\nexperimental and under development, and may completely change or disappear at\nsome point.\n\nThe LUMI software stack is activated by loading the desired version of the LUMI\nmodule, e.g.,\n\n```bash\nmodule load LUMI/23.09\n```\n\nThe `LUMI` module will try to detect the node type it is running on and will\nautomatically select the software stack for the node type by automatically\nloading a `partition` module. However, that choice can always be overwritten by\nloading another `partition` module, and this can even be done in a single\ncommand, e.g.,\n\n```bash\nmodule load LUMI/23.09 partition/L\n```\n\nwill load the software stack for the login nodes (which in fact will also work\non the compute nodes and data analysis and visualization nodes).\n\n??? note \"`partition/L` and LUMI-C compute nodes\"\n    Software in `partition/L` can be used on\n    the compute nodes also and there is even some MPI-based software already\n    installed in that partition. However, \n    software compiled in `partition/C` may offer better performance on the\n    compute nodes of LUMI-C as software in that partition is specifically\n    optimized for the zen3 \"Milan\" CPUs in those nodes.\n\n    Running MPI programs is not supported on the login nodes, but those modules\n    may still contain useful pre- or postprocessing software that can be used\n    on the login nodes.\n\nOnce loaded, you will be presented with a lot of modules in a flat naming scheme.\nThis means that all software available in that version of the LUMI software\nstack will be shown by `module avail` (except for hidden modules for software that\nwe deem most users may not directly load). However, not any combination of\nmodules can be loaded together. In particular, software compiled with different\nprogramming environments cannot be used together. There are five types of\nmodules:\n\n-   The module version contains `cpeGNU-yy.mm` (with `yy.mm` the version of the\n    LUMI stack): The package is compiled with the `PrgEnv-gnu` programming\n    environment.\n\n-   The module version contains `cpeCray-yy.mm`: The package is compiled with\n    the `PrgEnv-cray` programming environment.\n\n-   The module version contains `cpeAOCC-yy.mm`: The package is compiled with\n    the `PrgEnv-aocc` programming environment, the AMD compilers for CPU-only\n    work (hence available only on LUMI-C, LUMI-D and the login nodes)\n\n-   The module version contains `cpeAMD-yy.mm`: The package is compiled\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MODULECOLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ModuleColour modules can be used to turn the color on or off in the module display)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODULELABEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ModuleLabel changes the way modules are subdivided and presented, with variations like label, PEhierarchy, and system for different display styles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODULEPOWERUSER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ModulePowerUser reveals hidden modules important mostly to sysadmins or users interested in EasyBuild development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODULEEXTENSIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ModuleExtensions/hide and ModuleExtensions/show are commands to hide or show module extensions in the module avail overview)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CrayEnv provides the default Cray environment enriched with additional tools, detecting node type and loading appropriate architecture modules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is the main software stack, managed with EasyBuild, containing software built with system compiler and various PrgEnv programming environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASYBUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework used for managing the LUMI software stack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRGENV-GNU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PrgEnv-gnu is a programming environment within the LUMI stack, indicating software compiled with GNU compilers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRGENV-CRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PrgEnv-cray is a programming environment within the LUMI stack, indicating software compiled with Cray compilers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRGENV-AOCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PrgEnv-aocc is a programming environment within the LUMI stack, indicating software compiled with AMD's AOCC compilers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRGENV-AMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PrgEnv-amd is a programming environment within the LUMI stack, indicating software compiled with AMD compilers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>EASYBUILD<|>LUMI software stack is managed mostly with EasyBuild<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>PRGENV-GNU<|>LUMI contains software built with the PrgEnv-gnu programming environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>PRGENV-CRAY<|>LUMI contains software built with the PrgEnv-cray programming environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>PRGENV-AOCC<|>LUMI contains software built with the PrgEnv-aocc programming environment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>PRGENV-AMD<|>LUMI contains software built with the PrgEnv-amd programming environment<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
