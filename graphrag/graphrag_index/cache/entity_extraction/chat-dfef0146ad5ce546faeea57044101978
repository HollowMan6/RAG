Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 5\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/installing_hands-on_perl.html\n---\n\n# Perl\n\nüí¨ Perl scripts and applications do not need installation. They can be simply\ndownloaded and run.\n\nüí¨ To run Perl applications, it's usually best to first load a Perl module.\n\n‚òùüèª A system Perl installation is available (without a module), but it is very\nbare-bones and is missing many commonly used libraries.\n\n1. To check available module versions, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   module spider perl\n   ```\n\n2. The current default version is `5.34.1` and can be loaded with:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load perl\n   ```\n\n3. To ensure scripts use the intended Perl version after loading a module you\nshould either call the script with `perl`:\n\n   ```bash\n   perl my_app.pl\n   ```\n\n4. or make sure the shebang line of the script is:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/usr/bin/env perl\n   ```\n\n## Installing Perl modules\n\nüí¨ Sometimes applications may require additional modules to run.\n\n- These \"Perl modules\", should not be confused with the software modules on CSC\n  supercomputers.\n\nüí¨ You should check the installation instructions for each module. For\nlibraries in CPAN, the easiest method is to use `cpanm`.\n\n- You can check out the\n  [CPAN documentation here](https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/view/bin/cpanm).\n\n### In this example, we'll add the Perl module JSON to our own environment\n\n1. Check if JSON is already available:\n\n   ```bash\n   perl -e 'use JSON;'\n   ```\n\n   - The error message indicates that it is not found, so you need to install\n     it.\n\n   üóØ By default, `cpanm` tries to install new modules to the Perl installation\n   path, which will not work.\n\n   - You need to set the location to a directory where you have write access.\n     It could be e.g. your project's `/projappl` directory.\n   - This is accomplished by setting a few environment variables.\n\n2. Replace the desired path for `PERL_BASE` and run the following:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PERL_BASE=\"/projappl/<project>/$USER/myperl\"  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   export PERL_MM_OPT=\"INSTALL_BASE=$PERL_BASE\"\n   export PERL_MB_OPT=\"--install_base $PERL_BASE\"\n   export PERL5LIB=\"$PERL_BASE/lib/perl5\"\n   mkdir -p $PERL_BASE\n   ```\n\n3. You can now install the module. In this case, it is in CPAN, so you can use\n   `cpanm`:\n\n   ```bash\n   cpanm JSON\n   ```\n\n4. To use the module, you need to tell Perl where to find it. In this case, you\n   can set the `$PERL5LIB` environment variable (already done above):\n\n   ```bash\n   export PERL5LIB=\"/projappl/<project>/$USER/myperl/lib/perl5\"  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n5. You can now try again:\n\n   ```bash\n   perl -e 'use JSON;'\n   ```\n\n   - This time there's no error message, indicating that the JSON module is now\n     available.\n\n## Additional info\n\nüí¨ The installation only needs to be done once, but you need to always ensure\nPerl knows where to find the installed modules.\n\nüí≠ There are three main ways to do this (we used the second already).\n\n### Option 1\n\n- Pass the path using the command-line option `-I`:\n\n  ```bash\n  perl -I /projappl/<project>/$USER/myperl/lib/perl5 ./my_app.pl  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n  ```\n\n### Option 2\n\n- Include the path in the `$PERL5LIB` environment variable:\n\n  ```bash\n  export PERL5LIB=/projappl/<project>/$USER/myperl/lib/perl5:$PERL5LIB  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n  ```\n\n### Option 3\n\n- Include the path in your Perl script with `use lib`:\n\n  ```bash\n  use lib '/projappl/<project>/$USER/myperl/lib/perl5';\n  use My::Module;\n  ```\n\n## Bioperl\n\nüí¨ If you need the BioPerl collection of Perl modules, you can find this\npre-installed on Puhti (try `module spider bioperl`).\n\nüí° See our [BioPerl documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/bioperl/) for more\ndetails.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
