However, these tools are not\nvery practical for moving many small files.\n\nA simple, much faster solution is to write a (compressed) tar package\ncontaining your data directly to the target system. This is accomplished by\npiping the output of `tar` over an `ssh` connection. Writing the archive\ndirectly to the destination helps also to conserve disk space on the source\nsystem.\n\nFor general information about tar, see\n[Packing and compression tools](../../support/tutorials/env-guide/packing-and-compression-tools.md).\n\n## Examples\n\nAll following commands are executed on a local workstation, which is assumed to\nhave the required tools (`tar`, `ssh` and, optionally, `gzip`/`bzip2`) installed.\nPuhti is used as the example remote server.\n\nThe general syntax is:\n\n```bash\ntar c <directory_to_transfer> | ssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi 'cat > <target_path_on_puhti>'\n```\n\nFor example, the command to copy a directory `myfiles` from your local machine\nto the directory `/scratch/project_2001234` on Puhti would be:\n\n```bash\ntar c myfiles | ssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi 'cat > /scratch/project_2001234/myfiles.tar'\n```\n\nTo extract the tar archive at the same time, replace the `cat` command as:\n\n```bash\ntar c myfiles | ssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi 'tar x -C /scratch/project_2001234'\n```\n\nConversely, you could also copy data located on the remote server to your local\nmachine using a command like:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi 'tar c -C <parent_directory_on_puhti> <directory_to_transfer>' > <archive_on_local_machine>\n```\n\nFor example, the command to copy a folder `myfiles` located in\n`/scratch/project_2001234` to your local machine would be:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi 'tar c -C /scratch/project_2001234 myfiles' > myfiles.tar\n```\n\nTo extract the archive at the same time:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi 'tar c -C /scratch/project_2001234 myfiles' | tar x\n```\n\n!!! info \"Enable compression\"\n    The above commands did not use compression. Replace `tar c` (`tar x`) with\n    `tar cz` or `tar cj` (`tar xz` or `tar xj`) to enable gzip or bzip2\n    compression (decompression). Note that some files do not benefit from\n    compression (e.g. binary files or files that are already compressed), in\n    which case it is faster to transfer without compressing.\n\n!!! info \"Avoid verbose output\"\n    Adding `v` option (e.g. `tar czv`) will produce verbose output, i.e. list\n    the processed files in the console. This slows down the transfer process\n    when moving many small files, so it is recommended to avoid using it.\n\n## Performance comparison\n\nBelow is a rough comparison of the time taken to transfer a directory with many\nsmall files to Puhti. Each file is 100 KiB in size and no compression is\napplied.\n\n| Number of files        | `tar` + `ssh` | `scp`    |\n|-----------------------:|--------------:|---------:|\n| 100                    | 0.5 s         | 2.4 s    |\n| 1000                   | 1.3 s         | 20.5 s   |\n| 10000                  | 9.4 s         | 201.2 s  |\n\n## More information\n\n- [Packing and compression tools](../../support/tutorials/env-guide/packing-and-compression-tools.md)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
