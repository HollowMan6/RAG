Umount the volume in the node before rebooting the node. It is not required, but recommended.\n\n    For a permanent disconnection of a VM, one need to do the inverse process of adding a new node. Umount the volume, remove the entry for this VM in the `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf` file of every node, and finally restart the daemons in every node. This needs to be done as it affects the quorum count for the cluster.\n\n* **Is it possible to mount a node as read-only?**\n\n    Yes, GFS2 has the \"spectator mode\":\n\n    ```\n    spectator\n       Mount  this filesystem using a special form of read-only mount.  The mount does not\n       use one of the filesystem's journals.

Meanwhile it is a different code base developed by a different vendor. The approach is the same as GFS2:\n\n![OCFS2](../img/OCFS2.drawio.svg)\n\nA single volume attached to a cluster of VM nodes, allowing the data reads and writes to be done directly, and a daemon running in each VM node that coordinates the read and write operations.\n\n### OCFS2 ansible install\n\nLike with GFS2, the Ansible playbook will create a cluster of VMs and install the requested file system on them. The end result will be the same volume mounted in every VM. It is very similar than the instructions for GFS2. The quick start commands are these:\n\n```sh\n$ source ~/Downloads/project_XXXXXXX-openrc.sh\nPlease enter your OpenStack Password for project project_XXXXXXX as user YYYYYYYY: \n\n$ ansible-playbook main.yml -e fs='ocfs2'\n\n$ for i in $(seq 1 16);\ndo\n    openstack --os-compute-api-version 2.60 server add volume \"cinder-ocfs2-$i\" multi-attach-test-ocfs2\ndone\n\n$ ansible-playbook main.yml -e fs='ocfs2'\n```\n\nYou need to run Ansible twice due to a bug in the `openstack.cloud.server_volume` which can only attach the volume to a single VM and fails with the other ones.\n\nIf you already have a cluster of VMs, or want to manually create them, it is still possible to use the ocfs2 Ansible role. The steps are simple:\n\n1. Create and attach the volume. See the manual [Create and attach a volume](#create-and-attach-a-volume) from above.\n\n1. Create a standard Ansible inventory like this one:\n\n    ```ini\n    [all]\n    <VM_name> ansible_host=192.168.1.XXX ansible_user=<user>\n    # ...\n    [all:vars]\n    ansible_ssh_common_args='-J <jumphost>'\n    ```\n\n    In the example above you need to replace `<VM_name>` by the name of the VM, the IP `192.168.1.XXX` must be the correct IP of the VM, and finally the `<user>` has to also be replaced by the corresponding one. You need to have a line per VM node that you want to include in the cluster. Finally, if you are using a Jump Host, you need to replace `<jumphost>` by its\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GFS2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GFS2 is a shared disk file system that allows for direct reads and writes across a cluster of VM nodes, with a coordinating daemon running in each VM node)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCFS2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oracle Cluster File System version 2, a shared disk file system developed by Oracle Corporation for direct reads and writes across a cluster of VM nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PACEMAKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pacemaker is a cluster resource manager that provides documentation and support for setting up clusters, including those using GFS2 and OCFS2 file systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANSIBLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ansible is an automation tool used to create clusters of VMs and install file systems like GFS2 and OCFS2 on them)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GFS2<|>PACEMAKER<|>GFS2 is supported and documented by Pacemaker for cluster setup and management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCFS2<|>ANSIBLE<|>OCFS2 installation and cluster creation can be automated using Ansible playbooks<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GFS2<|>ANSIBLE<|>Ansible playbooks can be used to automate the creation of clusters and installation of GFS2 file systems<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCFS2<|>PACEMAKER<|>OCFS2, like GFS2, is a file system that can be managed within clusters set up and supported by Pacemaker<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
