Batch queue system and interactive use\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 1\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/batch_jobs/serial.html\n---\n\n# Batch job tutorial - Serial jobs\n\n> In this tutorial we'll get familiar with the basic usage of the Slurm batch queue system at CSC\n- The goal is to learn how to request resources that **match** the needs of a job\n\nüí¨ A batch job consists of two parts: resource requests and the job step(s)\n\n‚òùüèª Examples are done on Puhti. If using the web interface, open a login node shell.\n\n## Serial jobs\n\nüí¨ A serial program can only use one core (CPU)\n\n- One should request only a single core from Slurm\n- The job does not benefit from additional cores\n- Excess cores are wasted since they will not be available to other users\n\nüí¨ Within the job (or allocation), the actual program is launched using the command `srun`\n\n‚òùüèª If you use a software that is pre-installed by CSC, please [check its documentation page](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/); it might have a batch job example with useful default settings.\n\n### Launching a serial job\n\n1. Go to the `/scratch` directory of your project:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/<project>      # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n- Now your input (and output) will be on a shared disk that is accessible to the compute nodes.\n\nüí° You can list your projects with `csc-projects`\n\nüí° Note! If you're using a project with other members (like the course project), first make a subdirectory for yourself (e.g. `mkdir $USER` and then move there (`cd $USER`) to not clutter the `/scratch` root of your project)\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Create a file called `my_serial.bash` e.g. with the `nano` text editor:\n\n```bash\nnano my_serial.bash\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Copy the following **batch script** there and change `<project>` to the CSC project you actually want to use:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=<project>      # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!\n#SBATCH --time=00:02:00          # Maximum duration of the job. Upper limit depends on the partition. \n#SBATCH --partition=test         # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, hugemem_longrun\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1               # Number of tasks. Upper limit depends on partition. For a serial job this should be set 1!\n\nsrun hostname                    # Run hostname-command\nsrun sleep 60                    # Run sleep-command\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Submit the job to the batch queue and check its status with the commands:\n\n```bash\nsbatch my_serial.bash\nsqueue -u $USER\n```\n\nüí¨ In the batch job example above we are requesting\n\n- one core (`--ntasks=1`)\n- for two minutes (`--time=00:02:00`)\n- from the test queue (`--partition=test`)  \n\nüí¨ We want to run the program `hostname` that will print the name of the Puhti compute node that has been allocated for this particular job\n\nüí¨ In addition, we are running the `sleep` program to keep the job running for an additional 60 seconds, in order to have time to monitor the job\n\n#### Checking the output and the efficiency\n\n- By default, the output is written to a file named `slurm-<jobid>.out` where `<jobid>` is a unique job ID assigned to the job by Slurm\n- Check the efficiency of the job compared to the reserved resources by issuing the command `seff <jobid>` (replace `<jobid>` with the actual Slurm job ID)\n\nüí≠ You can get a list of all your jobs that are running or queuing with the command `squeue -u $USER`\n\nüóØ A submitted job can be cancelled using the command `scancel <jobid>`\n\n## More information\n\nüí° [FAQ on CSC batch jobs](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/#batch-jobs) in Docs CSC\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM BATCH QUEUE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A system used at CSC for managing batch jobs and resource allocation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing environment where examples in the tutorial are executed, offering a web interface and login node shell for users)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for Scientific Computing, which provides the Slurm batch queue system and computing resources for various projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERIAL PROGRAM<|>EVENT<|>A type of program that can only utilize one CPU core, requiring specific resource requests in Slurm)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM BATCH QUEUE SYSTEM<|>CSC<|>The Slurm batch queue system is provided and managed by CSC for job and resource management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a computing environment offered by CSC for executing batch jobs and other computing tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERIAL PROGRAM<|>SLURM BATCH QUEUE SYSTEM<|>Serial programs require specific resource requests in the Slurm batch queue system to run efficiently<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
