Spark is excellent tool for data analysis and machine learning tasks when dataset grows too big for single machine to handle. \n\n## Available\n\nRahti\n\n## License\n\nUsage is possible for both academic and commercial purposes.\n\n## Deploying Spark into Rahti\n\nSpark template can be found from Rahti template catalog. Consult [Rahti user guide](../cloud/rahti/index.md) about how to get access and start new project. \nChoose **Apache Spark** -template and read notes carefully from *Information* view. Follow links if you need more information about components. \n\nClick **Next** to fill cluster variables. \n### Variables:\n\nListed below are some of the variables that can be changed.\n\n!!! note \n\n    The values for the CPU and Memory should only be changed (to avoid errors) after checking the project quota allocated to your Rahti project (from *Resources* - *Quota* view of project page left panel). Project quota can also be increased by admins, if needed. [Rahti projects and quota](../cloud/rahti/usage/projects_and_quota.md) The template assumes that the request and the limits are same for all the containers. If you wish to have different limits, it's recommended to edit the template (advanced users).\n\n#### Mandatory Required Values:\n- **Cluster Name**: Unique identifier for your cluster\n- **Username**: Username for authenticating and logging into your Spark cluster and Jupyter (Recommended: create a new username, don't use any existing one)\n- **Password**: Password for authenticating and logging into your Spark cluster and Jupyter (Recommended: create a new password, don't use any existing one)\n- **Worker Replicas**: Number of workers to have (Default: 4)\n\n- **Storage Size**: Persistent storage volume size (Default: 10G)\n\n#### Optional Required Values:\n- **Enable Jupyter Lab**: Specify whether if you want to use Jupyter Lab instead of the default Jupyter Notebook (Default: false) \n- **Master CPU**: Number of cores for the master node of the cluster\n- **Master Memory**: Memory for the master node of the cluster\n- **Worker CPU**: Number of cores for each worker of the cluster (Default: 2)\n- **Worker Memory**: Memory of each worker of the cluster (Default: 4G)\n\n- **Executor Default Cores**: Default value for Spark Executor Cores (See official [Spark documention](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) for more) (Default: 2)\n- **Executor Default Memory**: Default value for Spark Executor Memory (**Should always be less than the Worker memory!**) (Default: 3G)\n\n- **Driver CPU**: Number of cores for the driver (Jupyter Notebook)\n- **Driver Memory**: Memory of the driver (Jupyter Notebook)\n\n#### Do not change the following variables, unless you know what you're doing\n- **Master Image**: Docker Image for the Master\n- **Worker Image**: Docker Image for the Worker \n- **Driver Image**: Docker Image for the Driver \n- **Application Hostname Suffix**: The exposed hostname suffix that will be used to create routes for Spark UI and Jupyter Notebook\n\n\n!!! note \n\n    The data is stored on a single shared volume so it's essential that you choose your storage size big enough because it is not possible to increase it after deployment. Additional storage volumes can be added though.\n\nClick **Create** and **Close**.\nYou can see your new cluster getting provisioned in *Overview*-page. When provisioning is ready, you can find Jupyter UI from address https://< cluster-name >-jupyter.rahtiapp.fi and Spark UI from address https://< cluster-name >-spark.rahtiapp.fi\n\nDeploying Spark template creates you Jupyter notebook UI, Spark master and Spark workers according to worker replica variable described above.\n\nScaling the cluster can be done from *Overview* by increasing spark-worker pod amount with up and down arrows on right side of pod count icon. Decrease all pods to zero to shut down your cluster to save billing units. \n\n### Short descriptions about the deployed components\n- **Jupyter notebook** : lets you type the spark code in Python or R format and also provides you an option of running a terminal which can for example, used for uploading data to allas for long term storage. The URL for accessing the notebook can be found by clicking on the dropdown and then look for Routes which has the URL. By default, any notebook you launch in Jupyter, is connected to your cluster.\n- **Spark master**: which connects your jupyter notebook to read the spark code and coordinates your workers, it has web UI whose URL can be seen by clicking on the dropdown, and finding the Routes.\n- **Spark workers**: The workers are responsible for doing the actual computation. By default there are 4 workers created for you, you can create more by clicking on the up and down buttons. \n\n!!! note \n\n    Remember always to save your data to the Jupyter notebooks default path `/mnt/<project-name>-pvc/*` . PVC storage is a distributed and replicated persistent storage and available to all of your Spark pods. If you save data anywhere else, it will be deleted as soon as ephemeral pod is deleted. It is also recommended to save your valuable data occasionally to other location. **Allas** object storage is suitable for storing large datasets and analysis results. Allas can also be used to store raw data and Spark can be set to read it from there.\n \n\n## Using Allas object storage\n\nS3CMD tool is installed to Spark image and it can be used to transform valuable files to Allas object storage.\n\nOpen new terminal from Jupyter Notebook UI\n\n```bash\ncd to your p\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APACHE SPARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apache Spark is a high-performance distributed computing framework used for data analysis and machine learning tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti is a cloud service that provides a platform for deploying applications and services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jupyter offers interactive computing environments for programming, including Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is an object storage service used for storing large datasets and analysis results)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE SPARK<|>RAHTI<|>Apache Spark can be deployed into Rahti, indicating a usage relationship between the computing framework and the cloud service<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE SPARK<|>JUPYTER<|>Apache Spark integrates with Jupyter for interactive computing, showing a tooling relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER<|>RAHTI<|>Jupyter environments can be deployed into Rahti, indicating a deployment relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE SPARK<|>ALLAS<|>Apache Spark can use Allas object storage for storing data, indicating a data storage relationship<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
