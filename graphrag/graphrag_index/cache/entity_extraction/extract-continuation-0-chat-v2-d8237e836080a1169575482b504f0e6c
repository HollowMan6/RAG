SPAdes works with Illumina or IonTorrent reads and is capable of providing hybrid assemblies using PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and Sanger reads.\n\nSPAdes (`spades.py`) includes several separate modules:\n\n* BayesHammer – read error correction tool for Illumina reads, which works well on both single-cell and standard datasets.\n* IonHammer – read error correction tool for IonTorrent data, which also works on both types of data.\n* SPAdes – iterative short-read genome assembly module; values of K are selected automatically based on the read length and dataset type.\n* MismatchCorrector – a tool which improves mismatch and short indel rates in resulting contigs and scaffolds; this module uses the BWA tool [Li H. and Durbin R., 2009]; MismatchCorrector is turned off by default, but we recommend turning it on.\n\nWe recommend running SPAdes with BayesHammer/IonHammer to obtain high-quality assemblies. However, if you use your own read correction tool, it is possible to turn error correction module off. It is also possible to use only the read error correction stage if you wish to use another assembler.\n\nIn addition to the general purpose SPAdes there are specific SPAdes parameter sets for:\n\n* Coronaspades (`coronaspades.py`)\n* Metaviralspades (`metaviralspades.py`)\n* Rnaviralspades (`rnaviralspades.py`)\n* Metagenomics (`metaspades.py`)\n* Plasmid assembly (`plasmidspades.py`)\n* RNA-Seq assembly (`rnaspades.py`)\n\nSee the [SPAdes documentation](https://ablab.github.io/spades/installation.html) for more details.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [GNU GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 3.15.5, 4.0.0\n\n## Usage\n\nOn Puhti, SPAdes is activated by loading the `biokit` environment.\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nAlternatively, SPAdes can be loaded as an independent module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load spades/<version>\n```\n\nFor usage help, use command:\n\n```bash\nspades.py -h\n```\n\nAssembly tasks can be very resource demanding and, therefore, you should never run real SPAdes jobs on the login nodes of Puhti.\nFor any real analysis task, we recommend running SPAdes as a batch job.\n\nSample SPAdes batch job file:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=SPAdes\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --time=12:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --output==spades_out\n#SBATCH --error=sprdes_err\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --mem=32G\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n\nmodule load biokit\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK \nsrun spades.py --pe1-1 reads_R1.fastq.gz --pe1-2 reads_R2.fastq.gz -t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK -o SpadesResult\n```\n\nIn the example above `<project>` should be replaced with your project name. You can use `csc-projects` to check your CSC projects.\nMaximum running time is \nset to 12 hours (`--time=12:00:00`). As SPAdes uses thread-based parallelization, the process is considered as one job that should be executed within one node (`--ntasks=1`, `--nodes=1`). The job reserves eight cores `--cpus-per-task=8` that can use in total up to 32 GB of memory (`--mem=32G`). Note that the number of cores to be used needs to be defined with both `$OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable and in the actual `spades.py` command (option `-t`). In this case, we use `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` variable that contains the `--cpus-per-task`\nvalue. We could as well use `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8` and `-t 8`, but then we have to remember to change the values if the number of the reserved CPUs is changed.\n\nThe job is submitted to the batch job system with `sbatch` command. For example, if the batch job\nfile is named `spades_job.sh`, then the submission command is: \n\n```bash\nsbatch spades_job.sh \n```\n\nMore information about running batch jobs can be found from the [batch job section of the Puhti user guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\n## More information\n\n*\t[SPAdes website](https://ablab.github.io/spades/)\n*\t[SPAdes GitHub repository](https://github.com/ablab/spades)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPADES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SPAdes is a software tool for assembling genomes from short read sequences, capable of working with data from Illumina, IonTorrent, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore, and Sanger reads.
