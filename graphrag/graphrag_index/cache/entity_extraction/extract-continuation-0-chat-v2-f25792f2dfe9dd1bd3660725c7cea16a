Use the `module` command to query the available applications,\nlibraries or compiler suites, and dynamically initialize them.\nThe module system should be used for both interactive and batch jobs.\n\nThe **environment modules** provide a convenient way to set up everything\nrequired by a particular application. The module system modifies the\nenvironment variables of the user's shell so that the correct versions\nof executables are in the path and the linker can find the correct version\nof the required libraries. For example, the command `mpicc` points to\ndifferent compilers depending on the module loaded.\n\nCSC uses **Lmod** environment modules. They are developed at the Texas Advanced Computing\nCenter (TACC) and implemented using the _Lua_ programming language. More technical\ndetails can be found on the [Lmod homepage].\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Basic usage\n\nThe syntax of the module command:\n\n```text\nmodule command modulename\n```\n\nListing the modules loaded (including your current environment):\n\n```text\nmodule list\n```\n\nThe command `module help` provides general information about a module. For\nexample, to get more information about the module `intel-oneapi-compilers`, use:\n\n```text\nmodule help intel-oneapi-compilers\n```\n\nLoad new modules to your environment with the command `load`. For\nexample, to load the `intel-oneapi-mpi` module, use:\n\n```text\nmodule load intel-oneapi-mpi\n```\n\nNote that you can only load modules that are compatible with the other\nloaded modules. That is, you cannot load modules that are\nconflicting with previously loaded modules, or modules that depend on\nmodules that have not been loaded.\n\nModules that are not needed or conflict with other modules\ncan be unloaded using `unload`:\n\n```text\nmodule unload intel-oneapi-mkl\n```\n\n### The most commonly used module commands {#module-commands-table}\n\n|  Module command                   |  Description                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| module help *modulename*          | Information about a module.                                                                         |\n| module load *modulename*          | Loads the default version of the environment module.                                                |\n| module load *modulename/version*  | Loads specific version of the module.                                                               |\n| module unload *modulename*        | Unloads the given environment module.                                                               |\n| module list                       | List the loaded modules.                                                                            |\n| module avail                      | List all modules that are available to be loaded (i.e. compatible with your current environment).   |\n| module spider                     | List all existing modules.                                                                          |\n| module spider *modulename*        | Search the entire list of existing modules.                                                         |\n| module spider *modulename/version*| Gives information on how to load the module (prerequisites etc).                                    |\n| module swap *modulename1 modulename2* | Replaces a module with another (and tries to re-load compatible versions of other loaded modules).  |\n| module show *modulename*          | Show commands in the module file.                                                                   |\n| module purge                      | Unloads all modules.                                                                                |\n\n### Finding modules\n\nYou can list the modules that are compatible with your current module\nset by using:\n\n```text\nmodule avail\n```\n\nBecause of the hierarchical structure of the _Lmod_ system, it is not possible to\nload all installed modules simply using a single `module load` command. The\n`avail` command does not show modules that cannot be loaded due to\nconflicts or unmet dependencies. These protective\nrestrictions prevent the loading of incompatible module combinations.\n\nList all installed software packages:\n\n```text\nmodule spider\n```\n\nList modules by name:\n\n```text\nmodule spider int\n```\n\nThe above command will list all modules with the string _int_ in their name. A more detailed\ndescription of a module can be printed using the full module name with a version number:\n\n```text\nmodule spider intel-oneapi-mkl/2022.1.0\n```\n\n### Solving module dependencies\n\nSome modules depend on other modules. If a required module is missing, the module system\nprints an error message:\n\n```text\n$ module load parallel-netcdf\n\nLmod has detected the following error:  These module(s) exist but\ncannot be loaded as requested: \"parallel-netcdf\"\nTry: \"module spider parallel-netcdf\" to see how to load the module(s).\n\n$ module spider parallel-netcdf\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  parallel-netcdf:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Versions:\n        parallel-netcdf/1.12.2\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  For detailed information about a specific \"parallel-netcdf\" module\n  (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.\n  For example:\n\n$ module spider parallel-netcdf/1.12.2\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nIn such cases, the `module avail` command excludes the module from the list and the\n`module load` command cannot find it. The easiest way to find out the required environment\nis to use the `module spider` command with the version information. For example:\n\n```text\n$ module spider parallel-netcdf/1.12.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n parallel-netcdf: parallel-netcdf/1.12.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before\n the \"parallel-netcdf/1.12.2\" module is available to load.\n\n  gcc/11.3.0  openmpi/4.1.4\n  gcc/9.4.0  openmpi/4.1.4\n  intel-oneapi-compilers-classic/2021.6.0  intel-oneapi-mpi/202\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MODULE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A system for managing multiple software environments on a computer, allowing users to query, initialize, and manage applications, libraries, or compiler suites dynamically)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENT MODULES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Modules that provide a convenient way to set up the user's shell environment for specific applications, ensuring the correct versions of executables and libraries are accessible)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Lmod<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Environment module system developed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, implemented in Lua, for managing software environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS ADVANCED COMPUTING CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The institution where Lmod, an environment module system, was developed)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODULE SYSTEM<|>ENVIRONMENT MODULES<|>The module system utilizes environment modules to manage software environments<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Lmod<|>TEXAS ADVANCED COMPUTING CENTER<|>Lmod was developed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODULE SYSTEM<|>Lmod<|>Lmod is the specific module system used for managing software environments within the module system framework<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
