You don't need to\n    use these wrappers to compile an MPI code on LUMI. See [here][3].\n\nBelow are examples how to use the wrappers for the different programming languages.\n\n=== \"C\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ cc -c source1.c\n    $ cc -c source2.c\n    $ cc source1.o source2.o -o myprogram \n    ```\n\n=== \"C++\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ CC -c source1.cpp\n    $ CC -c source2.cpp\n    $ CC source1.o source2.o -o myprogram \n    ```\n\n=== \"Fortran\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ ftn -c source1.f90\n    $ ftn -c source2.f90\n    $ ftn source1.o source2.o -o myprogram \n    ```\n\nIn the example above, no additional options are provided. However, in most cases\nthis is not the case and the arguments used with the commands vary according to\nwhich compiler module is loaded. For example, the arguments and options\nsupported by the GNU Fortran compiler are different from those supported by the\nCray Fortran compiler.\n\n### Wrapper and compiler options\n\nThe following flags are a good starting point to achieve good performance:\n\n| Compilers    | Good performance                                  | Aggressive optimizations |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Cray C/C++   | `-O2 -funroll-loops -ffast-math`                  | `-Ofast -funroll-loops`  |\n| Cray Fortran | Default                                           | `-O3 -hfp3`              |\n| GCC          | `-O2 -ftree-vectorize -funroll-loops -ffast-math` | `-Ofast -funroll-loops`  |\n\nDetailed information about the available compiler options is available here:\n\n- [Cray Compiling Environment][cce]\n- [The GNU Compilers][gnu]\n\nThe man pages of the wrappers and of the underlying compilers are also a good\nplace to explore the options. The commands to access the man pages are presented\nin the table below.\n\n| Language | Wrapper   | CCE           | GNU            |\n|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|\n| C        | `man cc`  | `man craycc`  | `man gcc`      |\n| C++      | `man CC`  | `man crayCC`  | `man g++`      |\n| Fortran  | `man ftn` | `man crayftn` | `man gfortran` |\n\n### Choosing the target architecture\n\nWhen using the Cray programming environment, there is no need to specify\ncompiler flags to target specific CPU architecture, like `-march` and `-mtune`\nin GCC or `--offload-arch` for GPU compilation. Instead, you load an appropriate\ncombination of modules to choose the target architecture when compiling. \nThese modules influence the optimizations performed by the compiler, as well as\nthe libraries (e.g., which BLAS routines are used in Cray LibSci) used. Here is a\nlist of the relevant CPU target module available on LUMI:\n\n- `craype-x86-trento` : GPU partition GPUs (LUMI-G)\n- `craype-x86-milan`  : CPU partition CPUs (LUMI-C)\n- `craype-x86-rome`   : Login nodes and data analytics partition CPUs (LUMI-D)\n\nWe recommend that you compile with `craype-x86-trento` for LUMI-G and \n`craype-x86-milan` for LUMI-C, even if the compiler optimizations for these \nprocessors are immature at the moment. **You have to load these modules yourself\nwhen compiling your code from a login node** as the default module is \n`craype-x86-rome`.\n\nIn addition to the `craype-x86-*` modules for the CPUs, `craype-accel-*` modules \ncan be used to specify the target GPU architecture. Here is a list of the\nrelevant modules:\n\n- `craype-accel-amd-gfx90a` : GPU partition GPUs (AMD MI250x, LUMI-G)\n- `craype-accel-nvidia80`   : data analytics and visualization GPUs (NVIDIA A40, LUMI-D)\n\nLoading one of these modules will instruct the compiler wrappers to add the\nnecessary flags to optimize for the target GPU architecture. In addition, loading\na  `craype-accel-*` module will enable the linking to the GPU transfer library\n(GTL) used for GPU-aware MPI as well as enabling OpenMP target offload.\n\n### Libraries Linking\n\nThe wrapper will pass the appropriate linking information to the compiler and\nlinker for libraries accessible via [modules prefixed by\n`cray-`][libraries]. These libraries don't require user-provided options\nto be linked. For other libraries, the user should provide the\nappropriate include (`-I`) and library (`-L`) search paths as well as linking\ncommand (`-l`).\n\nIf you have used a Cray system in the past, you may be familiar with the legacy\nlinking behavior of the Cray compiler wrappers. Historically, the wrappers\nbuilt statically linked executables. In recent versions of the Cray programming\nenvironment, this is not the case anymore: libraries are now **dynamically\nlinked**. The following options are available to you to control the behavior\nof your application\n\n- Follow the default Linux policy and at runtime use the system default version\n  of the shared libraries (so may change as and when the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a high-performance computing facility that provides various computing partitions and supports multiple programming languages through compiler wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY C/C++<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cray C/C++ compilers offer optimization flags for performance enhancement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAY FORTRAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cray Fortran compiler supports different levels of optimization for performance enhancement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GNU Compiler Collection includes compilers for C, C++, and Fortran, offering various optimization flags)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYPE-X86-TRENTO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Module targeting GPU partition GPUs on LUMI-G)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYPE-X86-MILAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Module targeting CPU partition CPUs on LUMI-C)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYPE-X86-ROME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Module targeting login nodes and data analytics partition CPUs on LUMI-D)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYPE-ACCEL-AMD-GFX90A<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Module for GPU partition GPUs, specifically AMD MI250x on LUMI-G)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYPE-ACCEL-NVIDIA80<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Module for data analytics and visualization GPUs, specifically NVIDIA A40 on LUMI-D)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAYPE-X86-TRENTO<|>LUMI<|>Craype-x86-trento is a module used for compiling code optimized for LUMI-G's GPU partition<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAYPE-X86-MILAN<|>LUMI<|>Craype-x86-milan is a module used for compiling code optimized for LUMI-C's CPU partition<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAYPE-X86-ROME<|>LUMI<|>Craype-x86-rome is a module used for compiling code on LUMI-D's login nodes and data analytics partition<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAYPE-ACCEL-AMD-GFX90A<|>LUMI<|>Craype-accel-amd-gfx90a is a module for compiling code optimized for LUMI-G's AMD MI250x GPUs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAYPE-ACCEL-NVIDIA80<|>LUMI<|>Craype-accel-nvidia80 is a module for compiling code optimized for LUMI-D's NVIDIA A40 GPUs<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
