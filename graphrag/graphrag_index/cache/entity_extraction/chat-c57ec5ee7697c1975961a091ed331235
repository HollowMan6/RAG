Once pip is\nin place, the steps are the same for all systems.\n\n!!! info\n\n    If you do not have root/administrator access\n    to the system on which you want to run the command line clients,\n    see the instructions about [virtual environments](#optional-installation-in-a-python-virtual-environment).\n\nInstalling in Windows is also possible, but it is beyond the scope\nof this guide. Rackspace maintains a guide for [installing the python-novaclient on Windows](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/install-python-novaclient-on-windows/).\n\nWe recommend first familiarizing yourself with the [Pouta web GUI](launch-vm-from-web-gui.md) and the main concepts.\n\n## Overview of the OpenStack command line tools\n\nThere is a generic command line tool called \"openstack\"\nthat can be used to manage most things in OpenStack. There are\nindividual tools for managing only some specific functionalities of\nOpenStack such as \"neutron\" for managing networks and \"glance\" for\nmanaging virtual machine images. In most cases, the common openstack\ntool should be used. The other tools are deprecated by the OpenStack\nproject and are generally only necessary if you have scripts that\ndepend on them or you need to run certain administrative\ncommands.\n\n| Tool name | Package name | Used for |\n|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| openstack | python-openstackclient | Managing the entire OpenStack                                                                  |\n| nova      | python-novaclient      | Managing virtual machines and some limited functionality for managing e.g. volumes and images. |\n| neutron   | python-neutronclient   | Managing virtual networks and routers.                                                         |\n| glance    | python-glanceclient    | Managing virtual machine images.                                                               |\n| cinder    | python-cinderclient    | Managing volumes that can be attached to virtual machines.                                     |\n| swift     | python-swiftclient     | Managing objects with the Swift API                                                            |\n\n### Preparation\n\nTo prepare for the installation of the actual command line tools, we will\ninstall the pip and Python development packages.\n\n!!! info\n\n    We assume here that you already have Python installed. This is\n    most likely the case if you are running any of the operating systems\n    for which we have instructions here.\n\nFind out if Python is installed and which version it is:\n\n~~~~\npython --version\n~~~~\n\nYou will need Python 3 or newer in order to install the command line\nclient tools. If you are running even a relatively recent version of\nyour operating system, this should not be an issue. However, if you\nhave a Red Hat based system that is older than version 7, you will not be\nable to install Python 3 the normal way. See the note for\nRHEL/CentOS 6 users under the corresponding subheading below.\n\nIf for some reason you do not have Python installed, please [install it\nfirst].\n\n#### Preparation: Ubuntu-based systems\n\nIf running Ubuntu 16.04 or newer:\n\n~~~~\nsudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev\n~~~~\n\nFor versions older than 16.04:\n\n    sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev\n\n#### Preparation: Red Hat based systems\n\nIf running version 7 or newer:\n\n    sudo yum install python3-pip python3-devel\n\n!!! warning\n\n    If you are running RHEL/CentOS 6, the latest version of Python\n    available by default is 2.6. This is too old to run recent versions of\n    the OpenStack client tools. It is possible to install Python 3 for\n    these operating systems as well, but that is out of the scope of this\n    guide. You can find information on how to install Python 3 at\n    [SoftwareCollections.org]. Once you have done that, you should\n    be able to follow the instructions for newer Red Hat based systems\n    above.\n\n#### Preparation: OS X systems\n\nDownload the latest [Python setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)\"\n\nInstall the tools and pip:\n\n    sudo python ez_setup.py\n    sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install pip\n\n### Installing the openstack tool (all operating systems)\n\nFrom this point onwards, the installation instructions are the same for\nall operating systems.\n\n#### Optional: installation in a Python virtual environment\n\nIf you also run other Python\nsoftware besides the OpenStack command line tools on your computer, we\nrecommend using Python's virtual environments. Python's virtual\nenvironments are a way to create an isolated set of Python packages\nthat are only available in that virtual environment. They are very\nconvenient for keeping your Python installation clean and\nmanageable. You will also need to use them if you wish to install the\ncommand line client tools on a computer where you do not have root\naccess. In that case, your administrator will need to install Python,\npip and the virtualenv Python package for you. For more information\nabout virtual environments, see [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python].\n\nHere we give basic instructions on setting up a simple virtual\nenvironment for installing the client tools. If you do not want to use\nvirtual environments, you can skip these steps and move directly to\nthe installation instructions using pip.\n\nFirst install the python3-venv package. On Ubuntu:\n\n    sudo apt install python3-venv\n\nNote that on Red Hat based systems there is no need of installing a \ndedicated package. \n\nCreate a directory for your virtual environments\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
