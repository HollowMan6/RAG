This means that\nit is possible to wrap installations using e.g., mpi4py while still relying on\nthe host provided MPI installation.\n\nThe LUMI container wrapper is a general purpose installation wrapper that\nsupports wrapping:\n\n- **Existing installations on the filesystem**: Mainly to reduce the I/O load\n  and improve startup times, but may also be used to containerize existing\n  installations that cannot be re-installed.\n- **Existing Singularity/Apptainer containers**: Mainly to hide the need for\n  using the container runtime from the user.\n- **Conda installations**: Directly wrap a [Conda][conda] installation based on\n  a [Conda environment file][conda-env].\n- **Pip installations**: Directly wrap a [pip][pip] installation based on a\n  [requirements.txt file][pip-req].\n\n!!! warning \"The LUMI container wrapper is NOT generally recommended for managing Conda/pip installations\"\n    For some use cases, the LUMI container wrapper is an excellent tool for\n    managing Conda/pip installations. For other use cases, there are better\n    alternatives. See the [installing Python packages][python-install] guide\n    for an overview the recommended ways to manage Python installations,\n    including Conda/pip installations.\n\n!!! warning \"The LUMI container wrapper has some limitations\"\n    Please be aware of the [limitations when using the LUMI container wrapper\n    ](https://github.com/CSCfi/hpc-container-wrapper#limitations) before\n    wrapping your installations.\n\n!!! warning \"The LUMI container wrapper is experimental software\"\n    As the LUMI container wrapper is still under development, some of the\n    more advanced features might change in exact usage and API.\n\n## Examples of using the LUMI container wrapper\n\nThe tools provided by the LUMI container wrapper are accessible by loading the\n`lumi-container-wrapper` module that is available in the `LUMI` and `CrayEnv`\n[software stacks][softwarestacks].\n\n```bash\n$ module load LUMI\n$ module load lumi-container-wrapper\n```\n\nOnce the module has been loaded, you can use one of the front-end tools\n`conda-containerize`, `pip-containerize`, `wrap-container`, and `wrap-install`.\n\n### Wrapping a basic Conda installation\n\nTo wrap a basic [Conda][conda] installation, create an installation directory\nand run the `conda-containerize` tool\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir <install_dir>\n$ conda-containerize new --prefix <install_dir> env.yml\n```\n\nwhere `env.yml` is a [Conda environment file][conda-env].\n\nThis file can be written manually, e.g.:\n\n```yaml\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.8.8\n  - scipy\n  - nglview\n```\n\nor generated from an existing environment\n\n```bash\n$ conda env export -n <target_env_name> > env.yaml \n```\n\n*Windows and macOS will need to add the `--from-history` flag to the export command*\n\nor, alternatively,\n\n```bash\n$ conda list -n <target_env_name> --explicit > env.txt\n```\n\n*Using the `--explicit` option only works if the existing environment is on a\nLinux machine with x86 CPU architecture. Otherwise the result will not be\ntransferable to LUMI.*\n\nAfter the installation is done, you need to add the bin directory\n`<install_dir>/bin` to your `PATH`.\n\n```bash\n$ export PATH=\"<install_dir>/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nThen, you can call `python` or any other executables, Conda has installed, in\nthe same way as if you had activated the environment.\n\nIf you also need to install some additional pip packages, you can do so by\nsupplying the `-r <req_file>` argument e.g.:\n\n```bash\n$ conda-containerize new -r req.txt --prefix <install_dir> env.yml\n```\n\nwhere `req.txt` is a [standard pip requirements.txt file][pip-req].\n\nThe tool also supports using [Mamba][mamba] for installing packages. Enable\nthis feature by adding the `--mamba` flag, e.g. `conda-containerize new --mamba\n...`\n\nMake sure that you have read and understood the license terms for\n[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as well as any used\nconda channels before using the command:\n\n- [Terms\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of tools designed to wrap software installations inside an Apptainer/Singularity container to improve startup times, reduce I/O load, and make software usage more efficient by generating wrappers for installed software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package management system that allows users to install, run, and update packages and their dependencies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package installer for Python, allowing users to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAMBA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A fast, robust, and cross-platform package manager that is fully compatible with Conda, designed to be a drop-in replacement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>A supercomputing environment where the LUMI container wrapper is utilized, indicating a specific geographical or institutional context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAYENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the Cray environment, likely a software stack or computing environment associated with Cray supercomputers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>CONDA<|>The LUMI container wrapper directly supports wrapping Conda installations based on Conda environment files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>PIP<|>The LUMI container wrapper directly supports wrapping pip installations based on requirements.txt files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>MAMBA<|>The LUMI container wrapper supports using Mamba for installing packages, indicating compatibility and potential preference for Mamba over Conda in some scenarios<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>LUMI<|>The LUMI container wrapper is specifically mentioned as being available and utilized within the LUMI supercomputing environment, indicating a direct relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI CONTAINER WRAPPER<|>CRAYENV<|>The LUMI container wrapper is accessible by loading modules available in the CrayEnv, indicating integration with Cray supercomputing environments<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
