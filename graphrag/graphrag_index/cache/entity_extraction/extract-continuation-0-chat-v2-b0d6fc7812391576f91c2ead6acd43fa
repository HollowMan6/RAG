The main aim of\nagile software development is to continuously and quickly deliver new pieces\nof software and improve customer satisfaction.  Continuous Integration and\nContinuous Delivery (CI/CD) provides developers the necessary tools to streamline\nand accelerate the speed at which they can deploy new code and become more agile.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will set up a simple CI/CD pipeline using the Kubernetes concepts\nsuch as _ImageStream_, _BuildConfig_, and _Deployment``_. Please refer to these Kubernetes\nconcepts in [Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts](../rahti2/concepts.md).\n\n!!! info\n\n    In practice, CI/CD pipelines for complex applications involve the use of dedicated resources\n    and tools such as Tekton and Jenkins. However, simple applications can be deployed the way\n    described in this tutorial. The primary aim of this tutorial is to teach the core concepts of\n    Kubernetes in terms of CI/CD.\n\n## Preparation\n\nMake sure you have the `oc` command line installed, and that you are logged in. Please\ncheck the [command line tool installation](../rahti2/usage/cli.md) if you need help on that.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWe have written a hello world web application and defined the necessary Kubernetes objects to build\nand deploy it to Rahti 2. The following steps will quickly get you started:\n\nClone the source repository for the sample application.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/CSCfi/rahti-bc-example.git\ncd rahti-bc-example/\n```\n\nLogin to Rahti 2 if you haven't done so. You can copy your login command from the Rahti 2 UI.\n\n```\n oc login https://api.2.rahti.csc.fi:6443 --token=<your_token>\n```\n\nMake sure you are in the right project with `oc project` and if not you can create one\nwith `oc new-project <your-new-project-name>`.\n\nWe have all the necessary object definitions in the `rahti-bc-example` project under the `k8s-api-objs.yaml`.\nPlease refer to [Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts](../rahti2/concepts.md) to understand the objects\ndefined under `k8s-api-objs.yaml`. You can easily create these objects necessary for our CI/CD pipeline using\nthe `oc create` command as follows:\n\n```\n$ oc create -f k8s-api-objs.yaml\nimagestream.image.openshift.io/dockerfile-example created\nbuildconfig.build.openshift.io/dockerfile-example created\ndeployment.apps/dockerfile-example created\nservice/dockerfile-example created\nroute.route.openshift.io/dockerfile-example created\n```\n\nAt this point you have a simple CI\\CD pipeline created. The next step\nwill be to kick off the build and let the pipeline handle the build and\ndeployment. You can trigger such an action using the `oc build` as follows:\n\n```\noc start-build dockerfile-example --from-dir=./ -F\n```\n\nOnce the pipeline finishes running you can visit your application deployment\nby following the route which should look like `http://dockerfile-example-<your_project_name>.2.rahtiapp.fi/`.\nThis pipeline can be triggered again after any update to your application (e.g. update on `index.html`) and\nthe changes would reflect almost immediately. [Webhooks](webhooks.md) can also be setup\nto trigger the pipeline.\n\n## Cleaning up\n\nOnce we are satisfied with the application, let us not keep it running in the\ncluster but remove it with the command `oc delete`:\n\n```bash\noc delete all --selector app=dockerfile-example\n```\n\nThis will delete all objects with the label `app: dockerfile-example`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, a simple CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a static web page was created mainly\nusing the Kubernetes objects _ImageStream_, _BuildConfig_, and _Deployment_. The pipeline\ncan be further extended using dedicated tools and resources as [Jenkins](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html#builds-strategy-pipeline-build_understanding-image-builds),\n[Tekton](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/pipelines#tekton), and [Webhooks](webhooks.md).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT<|>EVENT<|>A methodology used to satisfy continuously changing software requirements, aiming for quick and continuous delivery to improve customer satisfaction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND CONTINUOUS DELIVERY (CI/CD)<|>EVENT<|>Provides developers with tools to streamline and accelerate the deployment of new code, enhancing agility)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, involved in CI/CD pipelines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEKTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Kubernetes-native framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing for pipelines to be defined within Kubernetes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENKINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source automation server used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform mentioned in the context of deploying a simple CI/CD pipeline using Kubernetes concepts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command line tool for managing OpenShift applications, mentioned as necessary for setting up CI/CD pipelines)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT<|>CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND CONTINUOUS DELIVERY (CI/CD)<|>CI/CD is a tool that facilitates the goals of agile software development by enabling quick and continuous delivery<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>TEKTON<|>Tekton is a Kubernetes-native framework, indicating its use within Kubernetes environments for CI/CD<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>JENKINS<|>Jenkins can be used alongside Kubernetes to automate tasks in CI/CD pipelines<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>OC<|>The oc command line tool is used for managing applications on Rahti 2, indicating a direct relationship between the tool and the platform<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
