For example:\n\n```bash\nmodule load hmmer/3.2.1\n```\n\nAfter this, the command line options of each `hmmer` command can be checked with option `-h`. For example:\n\n```bash\nhmmsearch -h\n```\n\n### Pfam database\n\nOn Puhti, you can use Pfam-A database with HMMER commands. You can also create your own HMM databases.\nFor example, comparing a protein sequence against a Pfam-A HMM-database could be performed with the following commands.\n\nFirst, open an interactive batch job session and load biokit:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive -m 4G -c 4\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nWith native HMMER, you can speed up the `hmmpfam` and `hmmserach` commands by using several\nprocessors. The number of processors, e.g. 4, to be used is indicated with option `--cpu 4`,\nbut the number is better replaced with an environment variable which already has it, *i.e.* \n`$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`, so it's always in sync with the batch script request:\n\n```bash\nhmmscan --cpu $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK $PFAMDB/pfam_a.hmm protein.fasta > result.txt\n```\n\nIn Puhti, HMMER jobs should be run as interactive batch jobs or normal batch jobs. Here is an example batch job file using 4 processor cores:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash \n#SBATCH --job-name=hmmer_job\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=04:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --account=project_123456\n#SBATCH --mem=8000\n\nmodule load biokit\nhmmscan --cpu $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK $PFAMDB/pfam_a.hmm protein.fasta > result.txt\n```\n\nThe job is submitted with command (where *batch_job_file* is the name of your batch job file):\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file\n```\n\nFor more information on running batch jobs, see the [Computing User Guide](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\n## More information\n\n* [HMMER user guide](http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/Userguide.pdf)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HMMER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HMMER package contains tools to create and modify sequence alignment based HMM-models, use them to do database searches and extend sequence alignments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU GPLv3<|>EVENT<|>The license under which HMMER is available, indicating it is free to use and open source)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A computing environment where HMMER is available for use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PFAM DATABASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A database that can be used with HMMER commands on Puhti for comparing protein sequences against Pfam-A HMM-database)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HMMER<|>GNU GPLv3<|>HMMER is available under the GNU GPLv3 license<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HMMER<|>PUHTI<|>HMMER is available for use on Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HMMER<|>PFAM DATABASE<|>HMMER can be used to compare protein sequences against the Pfam-A database on Puhti<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
