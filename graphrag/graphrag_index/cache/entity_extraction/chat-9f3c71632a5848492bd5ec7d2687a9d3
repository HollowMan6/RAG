It is assumed that you have some knowledge of supercomputing systems. If not, you can start by looking at [overview of CSC supercomputers](../../../computing/index.md).\n\n## Access to Helmi through LUMI\n\nYou first need to create a Helmi project according to the instructions here: [Helmi Projects on LUMI](../helmi-projects/).\n\nAfter creation of a project, the PI can invite additional standard users to the project:\n\n* [How to add members to project](../../../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project)\n\nThe project PI is responsible for ensuring that the [Helmi Terms of Use](https://a3s.fi/FiQCI/Helmi-Terms-of-Use-2022.pdf) are followed.\n\n## Connecting to LUMI\n\nDetails for connecting to LUMI can be read through the [LUMI Documentation page](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/).\n\nDetails for running jobs on Helmi through lumi can found in the [Running on Helmi](../running-on-helmi/) page.\n\n## Support channels\n\nThe main channel for support for Helmi use through LUMI is the [CSC Service Desk](../../../../support/contact/), reachable at servicedesk@csc.fi.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
