Thus, these files can be considered as consisting of\nlines of text. In so-called binary files, also non-ASCII bytes are used,\nand they cannot and are not intended to be convertible to readable text.\nTypical examples of binary files are compiled programs, images or compressed\nfiles. Normally, users work mostly with text files, and also in the examples of\nthis guide, we normally assume that the files contain some kind of text\ndata: letters or numbers.\n\nEach file has a name. The name can, in principle, be any combination of\ncharacters. However, several characters have a special meaning, e.g.,\n`?`, `*` and `#`, see [below](#special-characters) and\nthus, using these characters in filenames may cause problems. We\nrecommend that you only use ordinary letters (lower- or uppercase),\nnumbers, dots (`.`), dashes (`-`) or underscores (`_`) in\nfile and directory names. Also, using space characters in filenames \nmay cause problems. We recommend that space characters are\nreplaced by underscores, for example, `new_file.txt` instead of `new file.txt`.\nNote that Linux is case-sensitive: lower- and uppercase characters are not\nconsidered equal unlike in Windows computers, and, e.g., the names\n`New_File.txt` and `new_file.txt` refer to different files.\n\nIn Linux, the usage of filename extensions such as `.doc` or `.txt` is not\nobligatory. Most Linux tools do not require an extension to be specified.\nHowever, in the long run, using systematic naming conventions, including\nillustrative name extensions, makes file management easier.\n\nFile-processing commands:\n\n| Name    | Argument     | Description                                         |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| `cat`   | *file_names* | Print the contents of the specified file or files to the standard output (your screen) |\n| `chmod` | *file_names* | Change the access permissions of a file             |\n| `cp`    | *file_name1*<br>*file_name2* | Copy the file contents to a new file or new location |\n| `grep`  | *search_string*<br>*file_name* | Pick from the file the rows that contain a specific string |\n| `head`  | *file_name*  | Print the first rows of the file to the standard output (your screen) |\n| `tail`  | *file_name*  | Show the last rows of a file                        |\n| `less`  | *file_name*  | Show the contents of a file one screenful at a time |\n| `more`  | *file_name*  | Show the contents of a file one screenful at a time |\n| `ln`    | *file_name*<br>*link_name* | Create a link to a file               |\n| `mv`    | *file_name1*<br>*file_name2* | Rename a file or move it to another location |\n| `rm`    | *file_names* | Remove files                                        |\n\nYou can explore the contents of text files using the commands `cat`,\n`more` and `less`. These commands are safe to use as\nthey do not modify the files in any way. For example, you could read the\n`.bashrc` file in your home directory with the commands\n\n```bash\ncat .bashrc\nmore .bashrc\nless .bashrc \n```\n\nThe `cat` command (abbreviation for concatenate) prints the contents of\nthe specified file or files to the *standard output* which by default\nmeans your screen. The pager programs `less` and `more` are often more\nuseful tools for studying text files as they allow the user to see the\ncontent of the file one screenful at a time. In both programs, `more` and\n`less`, you can move forward one line at a time by pressing the *Return key* or\none screenful at a time by pressing *Space*. You can exit from the file preview\nby pressing `q`.\n\nThe `less` pager program is more advanced than `more`. For example, `less` can\nbrowse text also backwards, either one row at a time by pressing `k` or\none screenful at a time by pressing `b`. You can also search a text\nstring from the document by using slash (`/`) character. For example,\nto locate the string *ABC* in a file opened with `less`, type `/ABC`\nand the press *Return*. Actually, the `man` command uses `less` as its pager.\n\nThe commands `head` and `tail` can be used to see just the\nfirst and the last rows of a file, respectively. By default, these commands\nprint 10 lines, but you can change this by giving the number of rows\nto be printed as an argument to a `head` or `tail` command. For example,\nto check the last 30 rows of a file called `run1.log`, give the command\n\n```bash\ntail -30 run1.log \n```\n\nCopying files to a new file or to another directory is done using the command\n`cp` (copy). Below you can find two examples of copy commands:\n\n\n```bash\ncp output.dat output_copy.dat\ncp output1.dat output2.dat results/\n```\n\nThe first command makes a copy of file `output.dat` to a new file called\n`output_copy.dat`. In the second example, the files `output1.dat`\nand `output2.dat` are copied to an existing directory called `results`.\nThe command `mv` (move) is used to rename or move a file to\nanother\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASCII<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ASCII encoding rules define how text characters are interpreted in files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is an operating system that treats lower- and uppercase characters as not equal and has specific recommendations for filenames)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows computers consider lower- and uppercase characters as equal, unlike Linux)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to print the contents of specified files to the standard output)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHMOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to change the access permissions of a file)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to copy file contents to a new file or new location)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to pick rows from a file that contain a specific string)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to print the first rows of a file to the standard output)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to show the last rows of a file)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to show the contents of a file one screenful at a time, allows backward browsing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command similar to LESS, for showing file contents one screenful at a time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to create a link to a file)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to rename a file or move it to another location)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command to remove files)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>CAT<|>Linux supports the use of the CAT command for file content display<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>CHMOD<|>Linux supports the use of the CHMOD command for changing file permissions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>CP<|>Linux supports the use of the CP command for copying files<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>GREP<|>Linux supports the use of the GREP command for searching within files<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>HEAD<|>Linux supports the use of the HEAD command for displaying the start of files<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>TAIL<|>Linux supports the use of the TAIL command for displaying the end of files<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>LESS<|>Linux supports the use of the LESS command for file browsing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>MORE<|>Linux supports the use of the MORE command, similar to LESS<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>LN<|>Linux supports the use of the LN command for creating file links<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>MV<|>Linux supports the use of the MV command for moving or renaming files<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>RM<|>Linux supports the use of the RM command for removing files<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
