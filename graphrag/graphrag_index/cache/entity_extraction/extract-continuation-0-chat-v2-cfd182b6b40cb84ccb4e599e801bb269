Workflows are flexibly defined using YAML, JSON or through a Python API and stored in a MongoDB database. This page describes how to define and execute FireWorks workflows in CSC's computing environment using a MongoDB running in the Rahti container cloud.\n\n## Strengths of FireWorks\n\n* Easy installation\n* Can handle parallel (MPI/OpenMP) subtasks\n* Supports complicated workflows with several dependent steps\n\n## Disadvantages of FireWorks\n\n* Requires setting up a MongoDB database\n* Steep learning curve\n* May produce a lot of log files\n* May create a lot of job steps\n* Integrates with Slurm, but all subtasks must use identical resources\n\n## Installing FireWorks and setting up MongoDB in Rahti\n\nFireWorks is easy to install. We recommend using [Tykky](../containers/tykky.md) to install FireWorks within a Singularity container. A plain pip installation with `pip-containerize` is enough, just add the line `fireworks` to the `req.txt` file containing the requirements of your environment. For further instructions, see [the Tykky documentation](../containers/tykky.md#pip-based-installations). \n\nNote that the Python version used by `pip-containerize` is the first Python executable found in the path, so it's affected by loading modules. FireWorks requires at least Python 3.7, so make sure you're using at least this version. To this end, you can use the `--slim` flag of `pip-containerize` to utilize a pre-built minimal Python container with a much newer version of Python than the system default 3.6.8.\n\nThe process of setting up and connecting to a MongoDB database in Rahti is detailed in a separate tutorial, see [Accessing databases on Rahti from CSC supercomputers](../../cloud/tutorials/connect-database-hpc.md). Note that the OpenShift template in Rahti sets up MongoDB version 3.2, requiring that the PyMongo version used with FireWorks cannot be newer than 3.12. Thus, you may need to separately specify the PyMongo version in the `req.txt` file when installing FireWorks. For example,\n\n```\n# req.txt\n\nfireworks\npymongo==3.10.0\n```\n\n!!! Note\n    Please do not install FireWorks in a Conda environment that is sitting directly on the shared\n    Lustre file system. [CSC has deprecated the direct usage of Conda](../../support/tutorials/conda.md)\n    installations on our supercomputers to avoid performance issues due to the large number of files\n    brought by Conda. For reference, a Conda installation of FireWorks contains more than 24000\n    files, most of which are read each time the application is run. This causes startup delays and\n    degrades the performance of Lustre for all users. With this said, you can still continue to use\n    Conda environments, but only in case they are containerized. To achieve this easily, please see\n    the [Tykky container wrapper tool](../containers/tykky.md).\n\n## Defining and executing workflows with FireWorks\n\nThe basic components of FireWorks are the\n\n- LaunchPad (manages workflows and metadata)\n- FireTask (computing job to be performed)\n- Firework (list of multiple FireTasks)\n- Workflow (set of Fireworks including their dependencies and metadata)\n\nA FireWorker (e.g. your laptop or in this case either of CSC's supercomputers) fetches a workflow from the LaunchPad and executes it. To appropriately run FireWorks in CSC's computing environment, you need to additionally configure a QueueAdapter for running jobs through the queueing system. The content of the files used to configure these is described below.\n\n### Step 1. Setting up the LaunchPad\n\n!!! Note\n    This page focuses on the usage of YAML files and the FireWorks command-line interface to define and execute workflows. For instructions on using the FireWorks Python API, see the [official FireWorks documentation](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/).\n\nBefore configuring the LaunchPad, make sure that you have opened a connection to your MongoDB database in Rahti using WebSocat as outlined in [Accessing databases on Rahti from CSC supercomputers](../../cloud/tutorials/connect-database-hpc.md). Note that `websocat` should be launched in an interactive session to avoid stressing the login nodes. With the obtained target port, database username and password, run `lpad init` to interactively configure the LaunchPad:\n\n```console\n$ lpad init\n\nPlease supply the following configuration values\n(press Enter if you want to accept the defaults)\n\nEnter host parameter. (default: localhost). Example: 'localhost' or 'mongodb+srv://CLUSTERNAME.mongodb.net': localhost\nEnter port parameter. (default: 27017). : <target port>\nEnter name parameter. (default: fireworks). Database under which to store the fireworks collections: <database name>\nEnter username parameter. (default: None). Username for MongoDB authentication: <username>\nEnter password parameter. (default: None). Password for MongoDB authentication: <password>\nEnter ssl_ca_file parameter. (default: None). Path to any client certificate to be used for Mongodb connection: None\nEnter authsource parameter. (default: None). Database used for authentication, if not connection db. e.g., for MongoDB Atlas this is sometimes 'admin'.: None\n\nConfiguration written to my_launchpad.yaml!\n```\n\n!!! Note\n    Upon configuration, WebSocat may complain `\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FireWorks is an open-source tool for managing complex workflows with dependencies, using MongoDB for storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONGODB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MongoDB is a database used by FireWorks to store workflows, requiring setup and connection in Rahti container cloud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti is a container cloud service where MongoDB for FireWorks is set up and connected)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYKKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tykky is a tool recommended for installing FireWorks within a Singularity container)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON 3.7<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Minimum Python version required by FireWorks for operation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC's computing environment supports executing FireWorks workflows, with specific configurations for MongoDB and container use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAUNCHPAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LaunchPad manages FireWorks workflows and metadata, requiring configuration for use)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>MONGODB<|>FireWorks uses MongoDB to store its workflows and dependencies<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>RAHTI<|>FireWorks requires setting up and connecting MongoDB in Rahti for its operation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>TYKKY<|>Tykky is recommended for installing FireWorks, indicating a tooling relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>PYTHON 3.7<|>FireWorks requires at least Python 3.7 to operate, indicating a software dependency<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>CSC<|>FireWorks is described in the context of being used within CSC's computing environment, indicating a usage relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREWORKS<|>LAUNCHPAD<|>LaunchPad is a component of FireWorks for managing workflows, indicating a component relationship<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
