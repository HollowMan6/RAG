It covers modules for fluid and solid mechanics,\nacoustics, and electro-magneto dynamics.\n\nElmer utilizes third-party open source programs for pre- (e.g., Gmsh) and post-processing (e.g., ParaView, Visit).\nThe version installed includes Elmer/Ice solvers needed for glaciological simulations (ice-sheets, glaciers).\nElmer utilizes the MPI library for parallel computing with some solvers already having OpenMP parallel threading\ndirectives implemented.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 9.0\n- Mahti: 9.0\n- LUMI: 9.0\n\n## License\n\nElmer is licensed under GPL and (as for the `elmersolver.lib`) LGPL. It is free for everyone to use.\n\n## Usage\n\nOn Puhti and Mahti, the Elmer versions available can be listed using the command\n\n```bash\nmodule avail elmer\n```\n\nOn LUMI, one needs to first take into use the module files of CSC installed software:\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles/\nmodule avail elmer\n```\n\nThe default version of Elmer is loaded with\n\n```bash\nmodule load elmer/latest\n```\n\nWe recommend using this version (except for special reasons) on all platforms.\n\nBe aware that this version is frequently updated. If you have User Functions as compiled code added to your case, make sure to recompile upon such an update (the date is displayed upon loading the module).\n\n### Example parallel batch script\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n    This is a basic script for a 30-minute single node job using all 40 cores and reserving 2 GB memory for each core, where the Elmer input file is `myrun.sif`.\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash \n    #SBATCH --time=00:30:00\n    #SBATCH --job-name=jobname\n    #SBATCH --output=%x.%j.out\n    #SBATCH --error=%x.%j.err\n    #SBATCH --partition=small\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n\n    module load elmer/latest\n    # make sure the SIF is in the start-info\n    echo myrun.sif > ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO\n    echo \"starting Elmer simulation with SIF file\"\n    cat ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO\n    srun ElmerSolver\n    echo \"done\"\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n    The main difference on Mahti is that only full nodes can be allocated. A single node contains 128 cores (we do _not_ recommend to use [multithreading](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-mahti.md#hybrid-batch-jobs-with-simultaneous-multithreading-smt)). The following script submits a 6-hour job using 4 nodes and all 128 cores per node (hence in total 512).\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash \n    #SBATCH --time=06:00:00\n    #SBATCH --job-name=jobname\n    #SBATCH --output=%x.%j.out\n    #SBATCH --error=%x.%j.err\n    #SBATCH --partition=medium\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --nodes=4\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128\n\n    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\n    module load elmer/latest\n    # make sure the SIF is in the start-info\n    echo myrun.sif > ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO\n    echo \"starting Elmer simulation with SIF file\"\n    cat ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO\n    srun ElmerSolver\n    echo \"done\"\n    ```\n\n=== \"LUMI\"\n    Basic script for a 1-hour job using 4 nodes and 128 cores in total, where the Elmer input file is `myrun.sif`.\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash \n    #SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n    #SBATCH --job-name=jobname\n    #SBATCH --output=%x.%j.out\n    #SBATCH --error=%x.%j.err\n    #SBATCH --partition=small\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --nodes=4\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=128\n\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles/\n    module load elmer/latest\n    # make sure the SIF is in the start-info\n    echo myrun.sif > ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO\n    echo \"starting Elmer simulation with SIF file\"\n    cat ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO\n    srun ElmerSolver\n    echo \"done\"\n    ```    \n\nInstructions on how to submit and monitor jobs can be found in [CSC docs](../computing/running/submitting-jobs.md) and in [LUMI docs](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/slurm-quickstart/).\n\nIt can be advantageous to utilize fewer cores per node than available to increase performance in certain Elmer cases.
