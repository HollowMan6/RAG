Orchestration provides an easy way to create the entire infrastructure based on a reusable and human-readable template file. The template can describe many components of the infrastructure, such as servers, volumes and floating IPs. In the same file, it can attach the volumes and IPs to specific instances. A template can also define multiple instances connected to specific networks, some of which have floating IPs and some a volume attached. The file can also be used to modify the existing infrastructure.\n\n### Orchestration via the web user interface\n\n!!! info\n\n    You should use \"2018-08-31\" (\"rocky\") or older as the [Heat template\n    version](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/latest/template_guide/hot_spec.html#rocky). Features in newer template versions may not be supported. \n\n\nThese instructions provide a simple example on how to set up a stack via the web user interface. To create a Heat stack, click the \"Stacks\" link in the _Orchestration_ menu. The opened view displays all existing stacks and provides the button \"Launch Stack\" to launch a new stack. In the window which was opened after clicking the \"Launch  Stack\" button, you can upload an existing template that you created or you can start configuring your stack. Selecting a template is mandatory, and the template data can also be provided as direct input, as depicted in the picture below. Note that this picture contains a valid, yet simple example of a template which builds two instances and displays the IP address of the first instance.\n\n![Template selection](../../img/stacks-view.png)  \n\nHere is the example:  \n```yaml\nheat_template_version: rocky # As mentioned above, you can either use the date or the name\n\ndescription: Simple template to deploy a single instance in cPouta\n\nresources:\n  instance0:\n    type: OS::Nova::Server\n    properties:\n      image: Ubuntu-22.04\n      flavor: standard.small\n      key_name: my-key\n      networks:\n        - network: project_xxxxx\n\n  instance1:\n    type: OS::Nova::Server\n    properties:\n      image: Centos-7\n      flavor: standard.small\n      key_name: my-key\n      networks:\n        - network: project_xxxx\n\noutputs:\n  network0:\n    description: Output the networks of instance0\n    value: { get_attr: [instance0, networks] }\n  network1:\n    description: Output the network of instance1\n    value: { get_attr: [instance1, networks]}\n```\n\nAfter choosing \"Next\", the web user interface asks for a stack name and your password. After this, you can launch the stack. When the stack is built, it can be managed from the orchestration's _Stacks_ view. The items which were built as a part of the stack can be found in their corresponding menus. In this case, the two instances can be seen and managed in the instances menu. In the stack's Overview tab (Orchestration -&gt; Stacks -&gt; click the stack), you can also see the output defined by the \"outputs\" section in the picture's example. To delete all components created by the stack template, simply press \"Delete Stack\" on the Stacks page.\n\n### Using orchestration with the command line client\n\n!!! info\n\n    Be sure that `python-heatclient` is installed. You can install it by typing the command `pip install python-heatclient` (https://pypi.org/project/python-heatclient/)\n\nHeat can be operated with the OpenStack command line client, but currently you can still use the deprecated Heat command line client as well. Create a stack on the command line:\n\n```sh\nopenstack stack create -t /path/to/my/stack.yml my-heat-stack\n```\n\nShow the details of the newly created stack among other existing stacks, type the command `openstack stack list`:\n\n    openstack stack list\n    +--------------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------------+--------------+\n    | ID                                   | Stack Name    | Stack Status    | Creation Time        | Updated Time |\n    +--------------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------------+--------------+\n    | 98077bd5-9d69-47c3-98db-b0e19a60b1fa | my-heat-stack | CREATE_COMPLETE | 2016-06-08T07:34:46Z | None         |\n    +--------------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------------+--------------+\n\n### Explanations\nA template is composed of two major sections:  \n- The version used (`heat_template_version`)  \n- The resource(s) (`resources`)  \n\nThere are also optional sections like:  \n- The description (`description`)  \n- The parameter group(s) (`parameter_groups`)  \n- The parameter(s) (`parameters`)  \n- The output(s) (`outputs`)  \n- The condition(s) (`conditions`)  \n\nHere is a detail of each sections:  \n\n`heat_template_version`  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indicates that the YAML document is a HOT (Heat Orchestration Template) template of the specified version.\n\n`description`  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows for giving a description of the template.\n\n`parameter_groups`  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows for specifying how the input parameter should be grouped and the order to provide the parameters.\n\n`parameters`  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows for specifying input parameters that have to be provided when instantiating the template.\n\n`resources`  \n&nbsp;&nbsp\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
