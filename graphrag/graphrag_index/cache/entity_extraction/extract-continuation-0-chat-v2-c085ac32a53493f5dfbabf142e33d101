Namespaces/Rahti projects quota will be removed to only have CSC projects quota.  \n\nEach CSC computing project has its own quota. Initial quota is the following:\n\n| Resource                         | Default |\n|----------------------------------|---------|\n| Virtual cores                    | 4       |\n| RAM                              | 16 GiB  |\n| Storage                          | 100 GiB |\n| Number of image streams (images) | 20      |\n| Size of each registry images     | 5 GiB   |\n\nThis means that your CSC computing project can use up to 4 cores and 16GiB in total, it can be 1 Pod using the whole 4 cores and 16 GiB, 8 pods each using half a core and 2 GiB, etc...\n\n!!! Warning\n\n    If you have several users that can access the CSC computing project, they can create a new Rahti project (see above). Keep in mind that the quotas will be shared across the different Rahti projects.  \n    If you need to adjust your CSC computing project quotas, please contact us. More information [here](projects_and_quota.md#requesting-more-quota)\n\nYou can find the resource usage and quota of a project in the project view in\nthe web interface under **Administration -> ResourceQuota** and **Administration -> LimitRanges** in the `Administrator` menu.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the oc command line tool:\n\n```sh\n$ oc describe AppliedClusterResourceQuotas\nName:                      crq-200xxxx\nNamespace Selector:        [\"test-delete\"]\nResource                   Used  Hard\n--------                   ----  ----\nlimits.cpu                 500m  16\nlimits.ephemeral-storage   0     5Gi\nlimits.memory              1Gi   40Gi\nopenshift.io/imagestreams  1     20\npersistentvolumeclaims     0     20\npods                       1     100\nrequests.storage           0     200Gi\n```\n\n```sh\n$ oc describe limitranges\nName:                  limits\nNamespace:             test-delete\nType                   Resource  Min  Max    Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio\n----                   --------  ---  ---    ---------------  -------------  -----------------------\nContainer              cpu       50m  4      100m             500m           5\nContainer              memory    8Mi  16Gi   500Mi            1Gi            -\nopenshift.io/Image     storage   -    5Gi    -                -              -\nPersistentVolumeClaim  storage   -    100Gi  -                -              -\n```\n\n### Default Pod resource limits\n\nEvery Pod needs to have lower and upper limits regarding resources, specifically for CPU and memory. The lower are called `requests`, and the upper are called `limits`. The `requests` sets the minimum resources needed for a  Pod to run, and a Pod is not allowed to use more resources than the specified in `limits`.\n\nThe user can set the limits explicitly within the available quota, but if no limit is set by the user, the defaults are used:\n\n|Type|CPU|Memory|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|limits|250m|2500Mi|\n|requests|50m|500Mi|\n\nNote: `m` stands for milicores. `500m` will be the equivalent of 0.5 cores, or in other words half of the time of a CPU core.\n\nRahti 2 enforces a maximum limit/request ratio of 5. This means that the CPU or memory `limits` cannot be more than 5 times the `request`. So if the CPU request is 50m, the CPU limit cannot be higher than 250m. And if you want to increase the CPU limit to 1, you will have to increase as well the request to at least 200m.\n\n## Requesting more quota\n\nIf you need more resources than the defaults, you can apply for more quota by contacting the Service Desk. See the [Contact page](../../../support/contact.md) for instructions. Quota requests are handled on a case-by-case basis depending on the currently available resources in Rahti 2 and the use case.\n\n## Sharing projects with other users\n\n!!! info\n\n    When creating a Rahti 2 project which is associated with certain CSC computing project, by default all members the of \n    CSC computing project will have admin access to the Rahti 2 project.  \n    You can also add individually an user to a specific Rahti 2 project. The user must have a CSC or HAKA login.\n\nOpenShift has a flexible role-based access control system that allows you to\ngive access to projects you have created to other users and groups in the system.\nYou can give e.g. full admin, basic user, edit or read only access to other\nusers and groups in the system for collaboration.\n\nYou can edit project memberships in the web interface via **User Management ->\nRoleBindings**, in the `Administrator` menu. You can either give access rights to individual users, groups or Service Accounts by selecting either the _Users_,  _Groups_ or\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenShift is a container application platform that provides developers and IT organizations with a cloud application platform for deploying new applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and management overhead)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC COMPUTING PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A project within the CSC environment that has specific resource quotas for virtual cores, RAM, storage, and more, allowing for the deployment and management of applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti is a container cloud service that provides a platform for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications across a cluster of servers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE DESK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Service Desk is the contact point for requesting more resources or quotas for CSC computing projects and Rahti projects)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC COMPUTING PROJECT<|>OPENSHIFT<|>CSC Computing Projects utilize OpenShift for deploying and managing applications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC COMPUTING PROJECT<|>RAHTI<|>CSC Computing Projects can create new Rahti projects, sharing quotas across them<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI<|>SERVICE DESK<|>To request more resources or quotas for Rahti projects, users must contact the Service Desk<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
