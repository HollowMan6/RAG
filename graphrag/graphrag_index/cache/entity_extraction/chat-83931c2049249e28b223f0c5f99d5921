May cause some changes to usage\n  - See the instructions in Docs CSC for each software for details\n- Containers provide an easy way to install software\n  - A single-command installation if a suitable Docker or Apptainer/Singularity container exists\n\n# Containers\n\n- Containers are a way of packaging software and their dependencies (libraries, etc.)\n- Popular container engines include Docker, Apptainer (previously called Singularity), Shifter, Podman etc\n- Apptainer is most popular in HPC environments\n\n# Containers vs. virtual machines (1/2)\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"./img/containers-fig1.png\" /></div>\n\n# Containers vs. virtual machines (2/2)\n\n- Virtual machines can run a totally different OS than the host computer (e.g. Windows on a Linux host or vice versa)\n- Containers share the kernel with the host, but they can have their own libraries\n  - They can run, e.g., a different Linux distribution than the host\n\n# Benefits of containers: Ease of installation\n\n- Containers are becoming a popular way of distributing software\n  - A single-command installation from existing image\n  - More portable since all dependencies are included\n- Limited root privileges inside the container if the build system supports it\n  - Package managers (yum, apt, etc.) can be utilized even when not available on the target system.\n  - Some containers need full root access in to build\n\n# Benefits of containers: Environment isolation\n\n- Containers use the host system kernel, but they can have their own bins/libs layer\n  - Can be a different Linux distribution than the host\n  - Can solve some incompatibilities\n  - Less likely to be affected by changes in the host system\n  \n# Benefits of containers: Enviroment reproducibility\n\n- Environment can be saved as a whole\n  - Useful with, e.g., Python, where updating underlying packages (NumPy, etc.) can lead to differences in the behavior  \n- Sharing with collaborators is easy (a single file)\n\n# Apptainer in a nutshell\n\n- Containers can be run with user-level rights\n  - But: building new containers requires root access or support for `--fakeroot` option\n- Minimal performance overhead\n- Supports MPI\n  - Requires containers tailored to the host system\n- Can use host driver stack (Nvidia/CUDA)\n  - Add option `--nv`\n- Can import and run Docker containers\n  - Running Docker directly would require root privileges\n\n# Apptainer on CSC supercomputers\n\n- Apptainer jobs should be run as batch jobs or with `sinteractive`\n- No need to load a module\n- Users can run their own containers\n- Some CSC software installations are provided as containers (e.g. Python environments)\n  - See the software pages in Docs CSC for details\n\n# Running Apptainer containers: Basic syntax\n\n- Execute a command in the container\n  - `apptainer exec [exec options...] <container> <command>`\n- Run the default action (runscript) of the container\n  - Defined when the container is built\n  - `apptainer run [run options...] <container>`\n- Open a shell in the container\n  - `apptainer shell [shell options...] <container>`\n\n# File system\n\n- Containers have their own internal file system (FS)\n  - The internal FS is always read-only when executed with user-level rights\n- To access host directories, they need to be mapped to container directories\n  - E.g., to map the host directory `/scratch/project_2001234` to the `/data` directory inside the container: `--bind /scratch/project_2001234:/data`\n  - The target directory inside the container does not need to exist, it is created if necessary\n  - More than one directory can be mapped\n\n# Environment variables\n\n- Most environment variables from the host are inherited by the container\n  - Can be prevented if necessary by adding the option `--cleanenv`\n- Environment variables can be set specifically inside the container by setting on the host `$APPTAINERENV_variablename`.\n  - E.g., to set `$TEST` in a container, set `$APPTAINERENV_TEST` on the host\n\n# `apptainer_wrapper`\n\n- Running containers with `apptainer_wrapper` takes care of the most common `--bind` commands automatically\n- You just need to set the `$SING_IMAGE` environment variable to point to the correct Apptainer image file\n\n```bash\nexport SING_IMAGE=/path/to/container.sif\napptainer_wrapper exec myprog <options>\n```\n\n- Additional options can be set with variable `$SING_FLAGS`, e.g. `export SING_FLAGS=--nv`\n\n# Using Docker containers with Apptainer\n\n- You can build an Apptainer container from a Docker container with normal user rights:\n  - `apptainer build <image> docker://<address>:<\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
