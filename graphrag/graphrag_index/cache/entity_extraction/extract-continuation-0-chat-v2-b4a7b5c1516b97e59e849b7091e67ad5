For that, type the following command:  \n```sh\nhelm show values jupyterhub/jupyterhub > values.yaml\n```\n[ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/) is a good site where you can find packages\n\n### Edit and install from a repo  \nAfter exporting the default `values` you can edit or create a `config` file with your own values.  \nThen, you can install the `Chart` using this command:  \n```sh\nhelm install my-jupyterhub jupyterhub/jupyterhub -f config.yaml\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NGINX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HTML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HTML is a markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.
