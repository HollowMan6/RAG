It aims first at delivering a robust and efficient seismic reflection software package, dedicated to education, and to permit the processing of moderate size 2D seismic or GPR data sets.\n\n\n## Available\n\n__Seismic Unix__ is available in Puhti with following versions:\n\n* 44R28\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSeismic Unix is available in the __seismic-unix__ module:\n\n```\nmodule load seismic-unix\n<commands>\n```\nSeismic Unix can be used in Puhti with command-line or graphical interface, as interactive job or with batch system. In any case reserve suitable amount of computing resources: cores and memory. \n\n### Seismic Unix with Graphical User Interface\n\nSeismic Unix Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be started in Puhti web interface:\n\n1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi).\n2. Open [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md)\n3. After launching the Desktop, open Terminal\n\n```\nmodule load seismic-unix\ncd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>\n<commands>\n```\n\n### Working with Seismic Unix interactively\nFor relatively short analysis jobs, it is possible to use Seismic Unix in [interactive session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md).\n\n```\nsinteractive -i\ncd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>\nmodule load seismic-unix\n<commands>\n```\n\n### Using Seismic Unix with batch job\nFor longer analysis jobs, Puhti batch system should be used.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=project_200xxxx\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n#SBATCH --mem=4G\n\nmodule load seismic-unix\ncd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>\n<commands>\n```\n\n## License \n\nSeismic Unix is distributed under following license:\n\n```\nCopyright â–’ 2008, Colorado School of Mines,\nAll rights reserved.\n\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or\nwithout modification, are permitted provided that the following\nconditions are met:\n\n    *  Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n       notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    *  Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\n       copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n       disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided\n       with the distribution.\n    *  Neither the name of the Colorado School of Mines nor the names of\n       its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\n       derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nWarranty Disclaimer:\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES AND CONTRIBUTORS\n\"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
