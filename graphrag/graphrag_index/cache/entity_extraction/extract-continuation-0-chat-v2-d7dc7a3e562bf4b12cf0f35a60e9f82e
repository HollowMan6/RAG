Note that certain tools, for example `rclone`, can\nnonetheless be set up to use several Allas projects at the same time.\n\nNext, we enter the `zebrafish` directory:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2001659/genomes/zebrafish\n```\n\nWe can now upload files one by one to Allas using the `a-put` command:\n\n```bash\na-put Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n```\n\nAt the end of the upload process, the command reports:\n\n```text\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 files from Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa uploaded to bucket 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH in Allas as one file: \n2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpload summary:\n              Date                      Name  Files Size(kB)         Location in allas\n 12.10.20 12:10:50     Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa      1  1330852 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nOK\n```\n\nMoving data to Allas file by file is slow and produces a large amount of\nobjects. It is often more efficient to upload data to Allas one directory at a\ntime and store the data in bigger chunks. For example, to upload the\n`zebrafish` directory, we first enter the parent directory `genomes`:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2001659/genomes/\n```\n\nThen, we use `a-put` to upload the whole `zebrafish` directory to Allas as a\nsingle object:\n\n```bash\na-put zebrafish/\n```\n\nAt the end of the upload process, the command reports:\n\n```text\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n8 files from zebrafish uploaded to bucket 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH in Allas as one tar file: \n2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish.tar\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpload summary:\n              Date                      Name  Files Size(kB)         Location in allas\n 12.10.20 14:10:47                 zebrafish      8  3191656 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nOK\n```\n\nAfter this, we have another object in the `2001659-mahti-SCRATCH` bucket:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@mahti-login11 genomes]$ a-list 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH\n2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish.tar\n2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n```\n\nNote that the file `Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa` is in fact now stored in Allas\ntwice; both as an individual object (`genomes/zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa`)\nand as part of the `genomes/zebrafish.tar` object.\n\n### B. Downloading to Puhti\n\nNext, we download the same data to Puhti. After connecting to Puhti, we go to\nthe scratch directory of project 2001659 and load the `allas` module:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/project_2001659\nmodule load allas\n```\n\nIn this case, we want to use Allas with the project `project_2001659`, so we\ncan give the project name as an argument for the `allas-conf` command:\n\n```bash\nallas-conf project_2001659\n```\n\nNow the configuration process asks only for the CSC password and then sets up\nthe connection to Allas for project 2001659. As the Puhti scratch directory is\nshared by all project members, we create a user-specific subdirectory\n`kkayttaj`:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p kkayttaj\ncd kkayttaj/\n```\n\nWith the command `a-list`, we can now see the objects that were just uploaded\nfrom Mahti to Allas:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ a-list\n2001659-mahti-SCRATCH\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ a-list 2001659-mahti-SCRATCH\n2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish.tar\n2001659-mahti-SCRATCH/genomes/zebrafish/Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n```\n\nLocating data is easy as there are only two objects in the bucket, but as more\ndata is added to Allas, locating a specific file among dozens of buckets\ncontaining hundreds of objects may be difficult. In that case, you can search\nfor a specific file using the command `a-find`. In this example, we can check\nif an object contains the file `Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa`:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti-login12 kkayttaj]$ a-find -a Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa\n----------------------------------------------\nChecking bucket: 2001659-mahti-\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a data management service used for storing and handling large datasets, allowing users to upload and download data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>`allas-conf` is a command used to configure a connection to a specific Allas project for data management purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-PUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>`a-put` is a command used to upload files or directories to Allas, supporting efficient data management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIO_RERIO.GRCZ10.FA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file representing the genome data of the zebrafish species, Danio rerio, stored in Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a computing environment from which data is uploaded to Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment to which data is downloaded from Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT_2001659<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific project within Allas and CSC computing environments, used for managing access and data storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZEBRAFISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A directory containing genomic data of the zebrafish species, used in the context of data management and bioinformatics research)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS-CONF<|>ALLAS<|>`allas-conf` is a tool used for configuring connections to Allas projects<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-PUT<|>ALLAS<|>`a-put` is a command for uploading data to Allas, facilitating data management within the service<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIO_RERIO.GRCZ10.FA<|>ALLAS<|>The file Danio_rerio.GRCz10.fa is stored in Allas, indicating its role in data storage and management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Data is uploaded from Mahti to Allas, showing a connection in the data management workflow<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Data is downloaded from Allas to Puhti, indicating a link in the data access and management process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_2001659<|>ALLAS<|>Project_2001659 is associated with specific data storage and management activities within Allas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZEBRAFISH<|>ALLAS<|>The zebrafish directory, containing genomic data, is uploaded to and managed within Allas<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
