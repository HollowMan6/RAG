Kustomize is also developed by the Kubernetes teams and it is built in recent version of `oc` and `kubectl`. You can build a project using this command:\n\n```sh\noc kustomize build FOLDER\n```\n\nHowever some features are missing with the built-in tool, here is a list of the commands available with `kustomize`:  \n\n-  **build**                     Build a kustomization target from a directory or URL\n-  **cfg**                       Commands for reading and writing configuration\n-  **completion**                Generate shell completion script\n-  **create**                    Create a new kustomization in the current directory\n-  **edit**                      Edits a kustomization file\n-  **fn**                        Commands for running functions against configuration\n-  **help**                      Help about any command\n-  **localize**                  [Alpha] Creates localized copy of target kustomization root at destination\n-  **version**                   Prints the kustomize version\n\nYou can install the [tool](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/) separately. The command to build with `kustomize` is:\n\n```sh\nkustomize build FOLDER\n```\n\nA build won't apply, it will only output to `stdout`.  \nIf you want to apply your kustomize build, you can use this command:  \n\n```sh\nkustomize build FOLDER | oc apply -f -\n```\n\nHere is a table that compares both solutions:\n\n|   \t| Helm | Kustomize |\n|---\t|--- | --- |\n|Pros   |- Template functions are powerful <br>- Helm is a package manager, like apt or yum does, but for kubernetes <br>- Large amount of existing charts already out that can boost productivity |- Native in from kubectl v1.14 <br>- Uses of plain YAML <br>- Not a templating system but a yaml patching system |\n|Cons   |- More abstraction layers <br>- Less readable templates <br>- Require an external dependency <br>- Folder structure |- The strength of Helm is to be used as a package manager <br>- Does not follow the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle |\n\n## When using Kustomize?\nIt can be harsh to use Helm in a way that your applications will contains more curly brackets than nouns in your YAML files.  Kustomize allows you to work with a bunch of YAML files. It can be a good alternative by using **overlays** instead of **templates**.\n\n## What are overlays?\nOverlays are a kustomization (*kustomization.yaml*) that can depend on another kustomization. They can include new resource manifests, or patches for existing ones.\n\n## Example\nLet's see an example on how kustomize works. We'll take this repo: [https://github.com/CSCfi/kustomize-openshift](https://github.com/CSCfi/kustomize-openshift)\n\nIf we look at the directory, this is what we have:\n\n```sh\n├── base\n│   ├── deployment.yaml\n│   ├── kustomization.yaml\n│   ├── nginx-imagestream.yaml\n│   ├── pvc.yaml\n│   ├── route.yaml\n│   └── service.yaml\n├── overlays\n│   └── production\n│       ├── db.yaml\n│       ├── deployment.yaml\n│       ├── kustomization.yaml\n│       ├── pvc.yaml\n│       └── route.yaml\n└── README.md\n\n3 directories, 12 files\n```\n\nWe have a **base** and an **overlays** folder. Inside the overlays folder, we can find another folder called **production**.\nTo start using kustomize, you need to create a kustomization.yaml file. Use this command to create a kustomization file (optional):  \n\n```sh\nkustomize create\n``` \n\nHere is the content of the kustomization file inside the base folder:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\nmetadata:\n  name: arbitrarky\n\nresources:\n- pvc.yaml\n- deployment.yaml\n- nginx-imagestream.yaml\n- service.yaml\n- route.yaml\n```\n\nYou will notice a **resources** key, with different yaml files as values. A resource is a root relative path to a YAML or JSON file describing a k8s API object.  \nAnd now, let's have a look to the content of the `kustomization.yaml` file inside `overlays/production`:\n\n```yaml\nresources:\n- ../../base\n\npatchesStrategicMerge:\n- pvc.yaml\n- route.yaml\n\nconfigMapGenerator:\n- name: dbparams\n  files:\n  - db.yaml\n```\n\nBasically, if you run the command `oc kustomize base` or `kustomize build base`, you will have the output of `pvc.yaml, deployment.yaml, service.yaml` and `route.yaml`.  \n\nNow, if you run the same command as above but with `overlays/production` instead of `base`, you will have the same output but with some new stuff, like a configMap and modifications in `pvc.yaml` and `route.yaml`:\n\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
