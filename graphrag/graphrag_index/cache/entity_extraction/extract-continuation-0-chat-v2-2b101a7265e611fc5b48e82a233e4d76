By default, the command uses its own *7z*\ncompression file format, but it can utilize other compression file\nformats too.\n\nIn Puhti, 7zip is launched with command `7z`. To get access to the\ncommand, first load the required module with:\n\n```bash\nmodule load p7zip\n```\n\nThe basic syntax of the command is:\n\n```bash\n7z command -options archive_file file_names\n```\n\nThe most important 7\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT_3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A directory containing various sample text files related to a project, which are being compressed and managed using zip commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A file compression and packaging utility commonly used on Unix and Linux systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>7ZIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A packing and compression tool frequently used on Windows platforms, but also available on macOS and Linux systems)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_3<|>ZIP<|>ZIP commands are used to compress and manage files within the Project_3 directory<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT_3<|>7ZIP<|>7ZIP can be used to compress and manage files within the Project_3 directory after loading the necessary module<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
