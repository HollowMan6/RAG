We also use `APPTAINERENV_OMP_PROC_BIND=close` to ensure that threads are placed as closely as possible (to allow faster communication between threads). Note that [other options](https://theartofhpc.com/pcse/omp-affinity.html) for controlling thread affinity are also available, depending on your analysis.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_multithread\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2000\n\n# Load r-env\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Match thread and core numbers\nexport APPTAINERENV_OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n\n# Thread affinity control\nexport APPTAINERENV_OMP_PLACES=cores\nexport APPTAINERENV_OMP_PROC_BIND=close\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save myscript.R\n```\n\nIn a multi-core interactive job, the number of threads can be automatically matched with the number of cores by running a multi-threaded version of the `start-r` or `start-rstudio-server` commands:\n\n```bash\nstart-r-multithread # or\nstart-rstudio-server-multithread\n```\n\n#### OpenMP / MPI hybrid jobs\n\nFurther to [executing multi-threaded R jobs on a single node](#improving-performance-using-threading), these can also be run on multiple nodes. In such cases, one must specify the number of:\n\n- Nodes (`--nodes`) \n\n- MPI processes per node (`--ntasks-per-node`) \n\n- OpenMP threads used for each MPI process (`--cpus-per-task`)\n\nWhen listing these in a batch job file, note that `--ntasks-per-node × --cpus-per-task` must be less than or equal to 40 (the maximum number of cores available on a single node on Puhti). For large multinode jobs, aim to use full nodes, i.e. use all 40 cores in each node. Further to selecting a suitable number of OpenMP threads, identifying the optimal number and division of MPI processes will require experimentation due to these being job-specific. \n\nAs an example of an OpenMP / MPI hybrid job, the submission below would use a total of four MPI processes (two tasks per node with two nodes reserved), with each process employing eight OpenMP threads. Overall, the job would use 32 cores (`--cpus-per-task × --ntasks-per-node × --nodes`). As with multi-threaded jobs running on a single node, the number of threads and cores is matched using `APPTAINERENV_OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`. We also use the same variables for thread affinity control.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_multithread_multinode\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2000\n\n# Load r-env\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Match thread and core numbers\nexport APPTAINERENV_OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n\n# Thread affinity control\nexport APPTAINERENV_OMP_PLACES=cores\nexport APPTAINERENV_OMP_PROC_BIND=close\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save myscript.R\n```\n\n#### Using fast local storage\n\nFor I/O-intensive analyses, [fast local storage](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#local-storage) can be used in non-interactive batch jobs with minor changes to the batch job file. Interactive R jobs use fast local storage by default.\n\nAn example of a serial batch job using 10 GB of fast local storage (`--gres=nvme:10`) is given below. Here a temporary directory is specified using the environment variable `TMPDIR`, in contrast to the prior examples where it was set as `/scratch/<project>`.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_serial_fastlocal\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n#SBATCH --gres=nvme:10\n\n# Load the module\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify NVMe temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=$TMPDIR\" >> ~/.Ren\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINERENV_OMP_PLACES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A configuration setting used to bind each thread to a single core to allow faster communication between threads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPTAINERENV_OMP_PROC_BIND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A configuration setting used to ensure that threads are placed as closely as possible)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R-ENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module for running R scripts, loaded before executing R scripts in batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment variable specifying the number of CPU cores per task in a SLURM job)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP / MPI HYBRID JOBS<|>EVENT<|>Jobs that run on multiple nodes using a combination of OpenMP threading and MPI processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>The computing environment where the jobs are executed, potentially referring to a supercomputer or computing cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TMPDIR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment variable specifying the path to a temporary directory used in batch jobs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPTAINERENV_OMP_PLACES<|>APPTAINERENV_OMP_PROC_BIND<|>Both settings are used together for controlling thread affinity in multi-threaded jobs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R-ENV<|>SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK<|>The R-ENV module is loaded in a job script where SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK is used to match the number of threads to cores<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENMP / MPI HYBRID JOBS<|>PUHTI<|>OpenMP / MPI hybrid jobs are executed within the Puhti computing environment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TMPDIR<|>R-ENV<|>The TMPDIR variable is set in the context of running R scripts, indicating a connection to the R-ENV module<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
