Also, don't forget to\ninclude the 'target=_blank' attribute for links pointing outside of Docs)... -->\n[Default](https://example.com/Default){ .md-button .md-button--primary target=_blank }\n\n\n### Outlined button\n\n<!-- ...and the one you'd think would be the 'default' (without the '--primary' suffix in Material\nfor MkDocs) is called 'outlined' in the CSC Design System. -->\n[Outlined](https://example.com/Outlined){ .md-button target=_blank }\n\n<!-- So, to recap, if you wan't a 'normal' filled-in button (called 'default'), you must add the\n'.md-button--primary' class to the attribute list. -->\n\n\n## Tabbed content\n\n=== \"First tab\"\n    Content can be divided into tabs. The first one is visible by default.\n\n    !!! default \"\"\n        There can be any content, like this admonition, under tabs.\n\n=== \"Second tab\"\n    | Tables | work | fine | too |\n    |-|-|-|-|\n    | just  | as | an | example |\n\n=== \"And so on...\"\n    It can get quite messy:\n\n    !!! warning \"\"\n\n        === \"Probably not what you want\"\n            You can even have nested tabs under admonition under tabs.\n\n        === \"But possible, nonetheless\"\n            I would recommend against it, though.\n\n\n## Snippets\n\nFiles under _csc-overrides/assets/snippets/_ may be added as snippets on the current page.\n\nSuppose we have two Markdown files, _a.md_ and _b.md_ with the content\n\n```markdown title=\"a.md\"\nYes, this is _a.md_.\n```\n\nand\n\n```markdown title=\"b.md\"\nHello from _b.md_!\n```\n\nThe file _ref/a.md_ (relative to the base path above) added as a snippet with\n\n```markdown\n;--8<-- \"ref/a.md\"\n```\n\nwould look like this:\n\n--8<-- \"ref/a.md\"\n\nAdding _ref/a.md_ and _ref/b.md_ using\n\n```markdown\n;--8<--\nref/a.md\nref/b.md\n;--8<--\n```\n\nwould look like this:\n\n--8<--\nref/a.md\nref/b.md\n--8<--\n\nSnippets also work from inside the source code boxes. For example\n\n````markdown\n```markdown\n;--8<-- \"ref/a.md\"\n```\n````\n\nwould produce\n\n```markdown\n--8<-- \"ref/a.md\"\n```\n\nMore examples (untested in Docs CSC) can be found in [PyMdown Extensions Documentation](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/).\n\n\n[^1]: This is the footnote ...and here's a shoenote for the footnote: ðŸ‘žðŸŽµ\n[^2]:\n    Here's another footnote.
