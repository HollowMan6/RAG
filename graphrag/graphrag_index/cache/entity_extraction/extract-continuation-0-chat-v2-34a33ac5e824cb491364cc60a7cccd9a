Module system\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 1\npermalink: /hands-on/modules/modules-puhti.html\n---\n\n# Modules in Puhti\n\n> ‚òùüèª This tutorial requires that you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) that is a member of a project that [has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\n## Checking the default modules\n\n1. Log in to Puhti with your user credentials (SSH or [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)):\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi    # replace <username> with your CSC username, e.g. myname@puhti.csc.fi\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Try a `module` command! Check out which modules are loaded as default as you login to Puhti:\n\n```bash\nmodule list\n```\n\n## More module commands with Gromacs as an example\n\nüí¨ Let's imagine that you want to do some molecular dynamics simulations using the [Gromacs](https://www.gromacs.org/about.html) application.\n\n- It is always a good idea to start by checking [the application list in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/) to see whether this application is installed in Puhti and how to use it.\n\n1. Check out the [Gromacs page](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/gromacs/).\n2. Skim through the documentation and verify that the license allows you to use the software.\n3. Check what is the module command that you need to run to be able to load Gromacs in Puhti.\n4. Back on the command-line, check which Gromacs versions are available in Puhti.\n\n```bash\nmodule spider gromacs\n```\n\n‚òùüèª This might take a while as the command searches through all the available modules.\n\nüí¨ The list can be quite long. You can go to the next line with Enter, or stop viewing by typing `q`).\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Check if some versions can be loaded directly, *i.e.* are compatible with your currently loaded module environment:\n\n```bash\nmodule avail gromacs\n```\n\nüí° Tip: Another quick way to list the available versions is by typing the load command until the module name and then hit `TAB` twice:\n\n```bash\n$ module load gromacs # and here double press TAB\ngromacs                gromacs/2022.3         gromacs-env/2021-gpu\ngromacs/2021.4-plumed  gromacs/2022.4         gromacs-env/2022\ngromacs/2021.5         gromacs-env            gromacs-env/2022-gpu\ngromacs/2021.6         gromacs-env/2020       \ngromacs/2022.2         gromacs-env/2021\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 5\"}\n6. Which version is loaded with the default command? Is it the newest version? Try:\n\n```bash\nmodule load gromacs\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 6\"}\n7. Do you notice any changes in the output of `module list` compared to the first try? Try this again:\n\n```bash\nmodule list\n```  \n\n‚òùüèª If no version is given in the module command, the default version is loaded.\n\n- The default version is typically the latest **stable** version of the program.\n- It is recommended to also provide the version in the module load command, as the default version may change.\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 7\"}\n8. Let's try loading the 2021.6 version specifically:\n\n```bash\nmodule load gromacs/2021.6\nmodule list\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 8\"}\n9. If you want to do something else in the same session, it is usually best to reset the module environment to the default settings. This can be done by first removing all loaded modules and then loading the default environment:\n\n```bash\nmodule purge            # Purge all (non-sticky) modules\nmodule list             # List the loaded modules\nmodule load StdEnv      # Load the default module environment\nmodule list             # List the loaded modules\n```\n\n## More information\n\nüí≠ If actually using Gromacs in Puhti, you would run the application as a batch job through the queueing system, which will be discussed in detail later.\n\nüí≠ Check out an [example batch job script for Gromacs](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/gromacs/#example-parallel-batch-script-for-puhti) to see how the module is recommended to be loaded (`module load gromacs-env` loads the latest minor release of a specific year).\n\n### Loading an older version of a module\n\nüí¨ Using an older version of a module is usually possible\n\nüí¨ As an example, you can try to load an old version of Gromacs from 2020.\n\n1. The `gromacs/2020.5` module cannot be loaded in the default environment since it has different dependencies. Check with the `module spider` command which other modules are needed for the older version:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider gromacs/2020.5\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Load all of the required modules manually before loading `g\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer service provided by CSC that offers computational resources and support for various scientific research needs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd. is a Finnish center providing IT support and resources for academia, research institutes, and companies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROMACS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gromacs is a molecular dynamics simulation software available on the Puhti supercomputer)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a service provided by CSC, offering computational resources for scientific research<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROMACS<|>PUHTI<|>Gromacs is an application installed in Puhti for molecular dynamics simulations<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
