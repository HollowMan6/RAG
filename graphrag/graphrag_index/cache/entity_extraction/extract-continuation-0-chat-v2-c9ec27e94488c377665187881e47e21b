For example:\n\n    ```yaml\n    #cloud-config\n    ssh_authorized_keys:\n    - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQ... your.email@example.com\n    ```\n\n- Generate a cloud-init ISO with your configuration\n\n    Using the `cloud-localds` utility, convert the YAML file to a cloud-init ISO:\n\n    ```bash\n    cloud-localds user-data.iso cloud-config.yaml\n    ```\n\n-  Boot the VM with the cloud-init ISO.\n  \n    Using QEMU, you'd boot the image as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    qemu-kvm  -enable-kvm -m 2048 -hda test100snapshot-v2.qcow2  -cdrom user-data.iso -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22\n    ```\n\n    The command will output `VNC server running on ::1:5900`.\n\n    The output `VNC server running on ::1:5900` indicates that QEMU started the virtual machine and is providing a graphical console via a VNC server. You can connect to this VNC server to see the VM's display and interact with it. We will try to onnect it using SSH.\n\n    The given QEMU command does a few things:\n\n    1. `-enable-kvm`: Enables KVM \n    2. `-m 2048`: Assigns 2048MB (or 2GB) of RAM to the virtual machine.\n    3. `-hda test100snapshot-v2.qcow2`: Sets the primary hard drive of the VM to the `test100snapshot-v2.qcow2` image.\n    4. `-cdrom user-data.iso`: Mounts `user-data.iso` as a CD-ROM in the VM.\n    5. `-net nic`: Creates a virtual NIC (Network Interface Card) for the VM.\n    6. `-net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22`: Sets up user-mode networking and forwards port 2222 on the host to port 22 on the VM. \n\n- Once the VM has booted and fully initialized, you can SSH into this image locally(the snapshot used here is an Ubuntu 22.04 flavor as an example):\n\n    ```bash\n    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p 2222 ubuntu@localhost\n    ```\n## 5. Uploading a VM image to cPouta\n\nUploading a VM image to cPouta can be done using either the Horizon web interface (WEB UI) or the OpenStack CLI. See more on [Adding Images](adding-images.md).\n\n- using OpenStack CLI, assuming you have sourced the OpenStack credentials as shown above.\n\n    Use the `openstack image create` command to upload the image as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    openstack image create \"testCentOS\" \\\n    --file  testCentOS.qcow2 \\\n    --disk-format qcow2 \\\n    --container-format bare \\\n    --private\n    ```\n\n    Check the created image is in the list of images that are available in your OpenStack project:\n\n    ```bash\n    openstack image list --long\n    ```\n\n- Using Web UI, first log in to web dashboard using your credentials.\n\n    - **Navigate to image management**: Under the `Project` tab, go to `Compute` -> `Images`.\n    -  **Upload the Image**: Click on the `+ Create Image` button and fill in the details:\n        - **Image Name**: Provide a name for the image.\n        - **Image Description**: (Optional) Add a brief description.\n        - **Image Source**: Choose `File Browse` and select your QCOW2 image.\n        - **Format**: Select `QCOW2 - QEMU Emulator` or `raw`.\n        - **Architecture**: (Optional) Specify the architecture (e.g., x86_64).\n        - **Image Sharing **: `Protected` `Yes`.\n        - Click `Create Image`.\n  \nAfter the command runs or web ui upload successfully, the image will be available for use.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD-UTILS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software package for managing cloud images)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD-IMAGE-UTILS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software package for managing cloud images on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD-LOCALDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Utility for converting cloud-config files into cloud-init ISO images)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QEMU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software that performs hardware virtualization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Secure Shell, a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK CLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Command Line Interface tool for managing OpenStack services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPOUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud service platform where VM images can be uploaded and managed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HORIZON WEB INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Web-based interface for managing OpenStack services)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD-UTILS<|>CLOUD-IMAGE-UTILS<|>Both are software packages related to managing cloud images<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD-LOCALDS<|>CLOUD-CONFIG.YAML<|>cloud-localds utility uses cloud-config.yaml to generate cloud-init ISO<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QEMU<|>SSH<|>QEMU's virtual machine can be accessed remotely via SSH<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK CLI<|>CPOUTA<|>OpenStack CLI is used for managing services in cPouta<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HORIZON WEB INTERFACE<|>CPOUTA<|>Horizon Web Interface is used for managing services in cPouta<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
