1/2\n\n- On a laptop you might be used to start a program (job) by clicking an icon, which starts the job instantly\n- If we start many jobs at the same time, we occasionally encounter problems like running out of memory _etc._\n- In an HPC environment, the computer is shared among hundreds to thousands of other users who all have different resource needs\n- HPC batch jobs include a resource request, which corresponds to an **estimate of how much resources the job is expected to use**\n\n# What is a batch job? 2/2\n\n- A batch job consists of two parts: A resource request and the actual computing step\n- A job does not start directly, but is sent to a _queue_\n- Depending on the requested resources and current load on the system, the job may need to wait for a while before starting\n- At CSC (and HPC systems in general), all heavy computing **must** be done via batch jobs (see our [usage policy](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/))\n\n# What is a batch job system?\n\n- A resource management system that keeps track of all jobs that use, or would like to use, the computing resources\n- Aims to share the resources in an efficient and fair way among all users\n- Optimizes resource usage by filling the compute nodes so that there will be as little idling resources as possible\n\n# Queueing and fair share of resources\n\n- A job is queued and starts when the requested resources become available\n- The order in which the queued jobs start depends on their priority and currently available resources\n- At CSC, the priority is configured to use \"fair share\"\n   - The _initial_ priority of a job _decreases_ if the user has recently run lots of jobs\n   - Over time (while queueing) its priority _increases_ and eventually it will run\n   - Some queues have a lower priority (e.g. _longrun_ -- use shorter if you can!)\n- See our documentation for more information on [Getting started with running batch jobs on Puhti/Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/getting-started/) and [LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/).\n\n# Schema of how the batch job scheduler works\n\n![](./img/slurm-sketch.svg)\n\n# The batch job system in CSC's HPC environment\n\n- CSC uses a batch job system called [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) to manage resources\n- Slurm is used to control how the overall computing resources are shared among all jobs in an efficient and fair manner\n- Slurm controls how a single job request is allocated resources, such as:\n    - computing time\n    - number of cores\n    - amount of memory\n    - other resources like GPUs, local disk, _etc._\n- Getting started with Slurm batch jobs on [Puhti/Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/getting-started/) and [LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/slurm-quickstart/)\n\n# An example serial batch job script for Puhti\n\n- A batch script is a shell script (bash) that consists of two sections:\n   - Resource requests flagged with `#SBATCH` and the actual computing step(s)\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=print_hostname   # Defines the job name shown in the queue\n#SBATCH --time=00:01:00             # Defines the max time the job can run\n#SBATCH --partition=test            # Defines the queue in which to run the job\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1                  # Defines the number of tasks (processes)\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1           # Total number of cores is ntasks * cpus-per-task\n#SBATCH --account=<project>         # Defines the billing project, e.g. project_2001234 (mandatory field)\n\nsrun echo \"Hello $USER! You are on node $HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\n- The options are described in Docs CSC: [Create Puhti batch jobs](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/)\n   - The actual _program_ is launched using the `srun` command\n   - The content above could be copied into a file `serial.bash` and submitted to the queue with `sbatch simple_serial.bash`\n\n# Using an application-specific batch script template\n\n<div class=\"column\">\n\n- The [application pages in Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/) contain example scripts for some software\n- Use these as the *starting point* for your own scripts\n- They have been tested and optimized (although for minimal resources) for _that_ application\n   - Consult the official manual or other examples to adapt to your own needs\n   - Ask for support: <servicedesk@csc.fi>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"column\">\n\n![](\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd. is responsible for providing IT support and resources, including HPC environments and managing batch job systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE 4.0 UNPORTED LICENSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A license that allows sharing and adapting of the work provided attribution is given and share alike is followed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm is a batch job system used by CSC to manage resources and control how computing resources are shared among jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of the HPC systems managed by CSC, for which users can submit batch jobs using Slurm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another HPC system managed by CSC, alongside Puhti, for running batch jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer for which CSC provides documentation on running batch jobs and is part of the HPC resources offered)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>SLURM<|>CSC uses Slurm as the batch job system to manage its HPC resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>PUHTI<|>CSC manages the Puhti HPC system, where users can run batch jobs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>MAHTI<|>CSC manages the Mahti HPC system, alongside Puhti, for running batch jobs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC – IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE LTD<|>LUMI<|>CSC provides documentation and support for running batch jobs on LUMI supercomputer<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM<|>PUHTI<|>Slurm is used to manage batch jobs on the Puhti HPC system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM<|>MAHTI<|>Slurm is used to manage batch jobs on the Mahti HPC system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM<|>LUMI<|>Slurm is used for scheduling and managing batch jobs on the LUMI supercomputer<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
