Editors are normally used to modify or create\nrelatively small files like programs, parameter files or small input\nfiles. Systematic modifications to large input or output data files are\nnormally done with other tools.\n\nSeveral text editors are available in the CSC computing environment.\nHere we briefly introduce just three of them: **nano**,Â **Emacs** and\n**Vim**. Other frequently used text editors include **vi** and\n**gedit**. In addition to these general purpose text editors, many\napplication programs include their own special editing tools.\n\n## nano\n\n**nano** is a simple and handy tool for editing small files. It is\neasy to use, and it suits well as the first text editor of a novice Linux\nuser. nano is a text based editor: it does not include any mouse based\nfunctions or command menus. nano starts with command:\n\n```bash\nnano text_file_name\n```\n\nThis command opens the given file to the editor or creates a new empty\nfile if the file does not already exist.\n\nWhen the nano editor has started, you can see the basic commands listed\nat the bottom of the screen. The listed commands are executed by\npressing simultaneously the control key `Ctrl`, to which the program\nrefers with `^` sign, and some listed keys. For example, you can\nread the exit from the program with `Ctrl-x`, save the changes with\n`Ctrl-o` or read a new file to the editor with `Ctrl-r`. If\nyou already have some text in nano, `Ctrl-r` will add the content\nof the selected file to the end of the previously created text. With\n`Ctrl-v` you can browse the text one page forward and with\n`Ctrl-y` one page backwards. `Ctrl-w` command can be used to\nsearch certain strings (words) from the text. `Ctrl-k` cuts one line\nof text. To cut larger regions, first mark the beginning of the text to\nbe copied with `Ctrl-6` then move the cursor to the end of the area\nand press `Ctrl-k`. To paste the text that was cut, press\n`Ctrl-u`. More commands can be found from the nano help text that\nis opened by pressing `Ctrl-g`.\n\n![The Nano Editor](../../../img/nano.jpg \"Nano editor.\")\n\n## Emacs\n\n**Emacs** is a versatile editor that contains a large amount of\ncommands, functions and extensions. Emacs can be used in two ways: as a\ncharacter based editor like nano or through a graphical interface.\nUsing the graphical interface requires that you have X-term\nconnection to CSC or are using a\n[web interface remote desktop](../../../computing/webinterface/desktop.md).\nIn the character based mode Emacs commands are given\nusing `Ctrl` and `Esc` keys much like in the case of nano commands. In\nthe graphical interface you can use also mouse-based command menus which\nmakes working much more feasible for a new Emacs user. To start Emacs in\nCSC environment, type:\n\n```bash\nemacs file_name\n```\n\nIf using a web interface remote desktop, you can open the\ngraphical Emacs interface from `Application > Accessories > Emacs`.\nIn the graphical user interface the *File* menu is used to read in and save\nfiles. *Edit* menu include commands to copy, cut and paste text. This menu\nalso contains tools to search and replace strings. With the commands in\nthe *Options* menu you can control many properties of Emacs. You can\nfor example use syntax highlighting when you are working with a\nprogram or a shell script file. You can have several files opened in one\nEmacs session. The *Buffers* menu allows you to choose the buffer to\nbe edited. The *Tools* menu contains miscellaneous commands and\ntools.\n\nIf you don't have remote graphics enabled, you need to know the\n[command shortcuts](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf).\nFor example, the shortcut to exit is `ctrl-x ctrl-c`.\n\n![Graphical interface of emacs editor](../../../img/emacs.jpg \"Graphical interface of emacs editor.\")\n\n## Vim\n\n**Vim** is a highly configurable text editor built to enable\nefficient text editing. It is an improved version of the **vi** editor\ndistributed with most UNIX systems. vi is the de facto standard\nLinux editor. Essentially all Linux systems come with vi (or a\nvariant, like Vim) built in.\n\nVim is often called a \"programmer's editor\" as it is useful for\nprogramming. It's however not just for programmers, though. Vim is\nsuitable for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing\nconfiguration files.\n\nTo start Vim in CSC environment, type:\n\n```bash\nvi file_name\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nvim file_name\n```\n\nVim differs from many editors in that it has two main modes of\noperation: *command mode*, and *insert mode*. This is the cause of much\nof the confusion when a new user is learning it.\n\nTo switch to the insert mode one needs to press the `i` key. When you\nhave finished entering a text, press `Esc` to return to the command\nmode. To save the file enter command `:w file_name`.\n\n!!! info \"Tip\"\n    The command to quit Vim is `:q`, which needs to be issued in command mode.\n\nTo exit Vim without saving, and ignoring any warnings about unsaved\ndata, use a variation of the `:q` command, i.e., `:q!`. This will return you to\nthe prompt without saving any changes to the file\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NANO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>nano is a simple, text-based editor for editing small files in Linux systems, lacking mouse-based functions or command menus, and includes basic commands for file manipulation and text editing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMACS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Emacs is a versatile editor with a large amount of commands, functions, and extensions, usable in both character-based and graphical interface modes, suitable for a wide range of text editing tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vim is a highly configurable text editor built for efficient text editing, known as a \"programmer's editor\", and is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vi is the de facto standard Linux editor, distributed with most UNIX systems, and Vim is an improved version of vi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEDIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>gedit is a frequently used text editor, not detailed in the text but mentioned as part of the computing environment for editing files)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIM<|>VI<|>Vim is described as an improved version of the vi editor, indicating a direct developmental and functional relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMACS<|>NANO<|>Both Emacs and nano are introduced as text editors in the CSC computing environment, indicating they serve similar purposes but with different complexities and features<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANO<|>GEDIT<|>Both nano and gedit are mentioned as text editors used for file editing, suggesting they are alternatives within the same computing environment<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
