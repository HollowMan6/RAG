The fair share mode allocates\nresources based on your job's priority, but the start of the job is also\nsubject to availability of the resources you requested, as well as the\npriorities of other user's jobs. However, a rough prediction based on the\ncurrent jobs and the resources they have requested can be made. To see all your\njobs and their job IDs, give:\n\n```bash\nsqueue -u $USER\n```\n\nAn estimate when a job would run (if no new jobs were submitted and if all \nrunning and queuing jobs used all the time they have requested) can be shown \nfor job ID 22425300 with:\n\n```bash\n[username@puhti-login12 ~]$ squeue -j 22425300 --start\n   JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST          START_TIME  NODES SCHEDNODES           NODELIST(REASON)\n22425300     small cool_job username PD 2024-07-26T06:27:12      1 r05c49               (Resources)\n```\n\n`Priority` as the reason for why the job is pending means that there are other\njobs in the queue with a higher priority. `Resources` on the other hand means\nthat your job is waiting for the requested resources to become available, and\nit will run as soon as they do. If you see\n\n```\nNodes required for job are DOWN, DRAINED or reserved for jobs in higher priority partitions\n```\n\nas the reason, don't worry. This \"reason\" may look alarming, but typically the\nnodes your job needs are just being used by other jobs, just like the message\nsays, and your job is indeed queuing as it should.\n\nYou can also show the current priorities of your jobs with:\n\n```bash\nsqueue -u $USER -o \"%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.8T %.10M %.9l %.6D %Q\"\n```\n\nTo minimize queuing, please also see:\n\n* [How to estimate how much memory my batch job needs](how-much-memory-my-job-needs.md)\n* [Why is my batch job queuing so long?](why-is-my-job-queueing-so-long.md)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
