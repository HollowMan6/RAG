It takes a while before the image is usable.\n\nIf you prefer to use the web interface instead, you can upload images\nin the **Compute | Images** section by clicking the **Create\nImage** button:\n\n![Image upload](/img/horizon-image-upload2.png)\n\nYou will be presented with this dialog:\n\n![Image upload dialog](/img/horizon-image-upload-dialog.png)\n\nIn this dialog, for example, we are creating an image called\n_Alpine-linux_. You can optionally add an **Image Description** for\nthe image, if you need it for your reference. Due to security\nconcerns, we support image uploads only via your local machine, and\nimage upload via public URLs is disabled. In this example, we have\nthus selected an image we want to upload from our local machine via the\n**Browse** button. In this example, our image is an ISO image, so we\nhave selected that in the **Format** drop-down menu. All remaining\nfields other than **Image Sharing | Visibility** can keep their\ndefault values. In the **Image Sharing | Visibility** checkbox, please\nmake sure that you have set the visibility of the image as\n_Private_. It is not possible for normal users to create public images\ndue to security reasons. In case you attempt to upload an image and\nset its visibility as _Public_, you will get an error message. Setting\nyour image visibility to _Private_ will make your uploaded image\nprivate to your particular OpenStack project, and only the members\nof your project can access it.\n\n## Sharing images between Pouta projects\n\nYou can share images between different Pouta projects using the\ncommand line tools. Image sharing between projects is currently not\nsupported using the Pouta web interface. Once shared, the image will be\nvisible in both projects, i.e. between the donor and acceptor\nprojects.\n\nPlease note that image sharing works within the same cloud environment, i.e. you\ncan share images from one cPouta project to another but not between a\ncPouta project and ePouta project or vice versa. \n\n1. First you need to get the UUID of the image you want to share (`<your-image-UUID>`). List all the images in the current project by:\n\n    ```sh\n    openstack image list\n    ```\n\n1. Secondly you need to get the UUID of the destination project (`<destination-project-UUID>`). You can list all your available projects by:\n\n    ```sh\n    openstack project list\n    ```\n\n1. Once you got the two UUIDs, you need to first make sure the image is of the **shared variant**\nif it isn't already:\n\n    ```bash\n    openstack image set --shared <your-image-UUID>\n    ```\n\n1. Then, initiate the share by executing the following _openstack_ command in the\nproject of origin: \n\n    ```bash\n    openstack image add project <your-image-UUID> <destination-project-UUID>\n    ```\n\n1. Finally the destination project needs to accept this membership. To do so,\nyou or your colleague needs to execute the following glance command in the\nacceptor project:\n\n    ```bash\n    openstack image set --accept <your-image-UUID>\n    ```\n\n[GitHub page]: https://github.com/CSC-IT-Center-for-Science/diskimage-builder-csc-automation\n[Kickstart]: https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/blob/master/docs/kickstart-docs.rst\n[OpenStack virtual machine image guide]: http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/index.html\n[creating images manually]: http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/create-images-manually.html\n[tool support for creating images]: http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/create-images-automatically.html\n[virt-sysprep]: http://libguestfs.org/virt-sysprep.1.html\n[cloud-init]: https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n[glance]: https://research.csc.fi/pouta-install-client\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
