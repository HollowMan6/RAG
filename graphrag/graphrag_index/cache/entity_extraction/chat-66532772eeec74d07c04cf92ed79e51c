Trinity combines three \nindependent software modules: **Inchworm**, **Chrysalis**, and **Butterfly**, applied sequentially to process \nlarge volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each \nrepresenting the transcriptional complexity at a given gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently \nto extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts derived.\n\nThe Trinity module at CSC also includes TransDecoder and Trinotate tools to analyze the results of a Trinity run.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [Broad Institute License](https://github.com/genome-vendor/trinity/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Available\n\nPuhti: 2.8.5, 2.11.0, 2.13.2, 2.14.0, 2.15.1\n\n## Usage\n\n### Using Trinity\n\nOn Puhti, Trinity is set up with the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nThe biokit module sets up a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools including\nTrinity 2.8.5. If you want to use a newer version, e.g. 2.13.2, run the command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load trinty/2.13.2\n```\n\nTrinity should be used [interactively in a compute node](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) \nor preferably through the batch job system. Below is an example batch job file for Trinity.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash \n#SBATCH --job-name=trinity\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --time=48:00:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1  \n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6\n#SBATCH --mem=24000\n#SBATCH --account=project_1234567\n\nmodule load trinity/2.13.2\n\nTrinity --seqType fq --max_memory 22G --left reads.left.fq --right \\\nreads.right.fq --SS_lib_type RF --CPU $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK \\\n--output trinity_run_out --grid_exec sbatch_commandlist\n```\n\nThe batch script above reserves 6 computing cores from one node for the job. The maximal run time of the sample job here is 48 hours. \nAbout 4 GB of memory is reserved for each core so the total memory reservation is `6 * 4 GB = 24 GB`. On Puhti, you must use batch job option\n`--account=` to define the project to be used. You should replace `project_1234567` used in the example with your own project. You can check your \nprojects with command: `csc-projects`.\n\nIn the actual `Trinity` command the number of computing cores to be used (`--CPU`) is set using the environment variable `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`. \nThis variable contains the value set by the `--cpus-per-task` Slurm option.\n\nOn Puhti, you can also use distributed computing to speed up the Trinity job. When the definition:\n\n```bash\n--grid_exec sbatch_commandlist\n```\n\nis added to the command, some phases of the analysis tasks are executed as a set of parallel sub-jobs. \nFor large Trinity tasks the settings of the `sbatch_commandlist` tool are too limited. In these cases \nreplace `sbatch_commandlist` with `sbatch_commandlist_trinity`.\n\n```bash\n--grid_exec sbatch_commandlist_trinity\n```\n\nWhen Trinity is executed with `--grid_exec` option, it generates a large amount of temporary files, and it \nis very likely that you will exceed the default limit of 100 000 files. Thus, it is advisable to apply for \na larger file number quota for Puhti scratch before submitting large Trinity jobs. You can send the request\nto [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\nWhen the batch job file is ready, it can be submitted to the batch queue system with the command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch batch_job_file\n```\n\nLook here for [more information about running batch jobs](../computing/running/getting-started.md).\n\nPlease also check the [Trinity website](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki) to get hints for estimating the required resources.\n\n### Using autoTrinotate\n\nYou can analyze the results of your Trinity job with `autoTrinotate`. You need two files resulting from a successful Trinity assembly.\n\n1. Fasta-formatted nucleotide sequence file containing the final contigs created by Trinity (`Trinity.fasta`)\n2. gene-to-trans map for the input fasta file (`Trinity.fasta.gene_to_trans_map`)\n\nNote that depending on the Trinity version, these names may have a prefix as defined with the `--output` option (e.g. `trinity_run_out.Trinity.fasta`).\n\nCopy a template sqlite database for your analysis:\n\n```bash\ncp $TRINOTATE_HOME/databases/Trinotate.sqlite mydb.sqlite\n```\n\nYou can then launch `autoTrinotate` with the command:\n\n```bash\n$TRINOTATE_HOME/auto/autoTrinotate.pl --Trinotate_sqlite mydb.sqlite --transcripts Trinity.fasta --gene_to_trans_map  Trinity.fasta.gene_to_trans_map --conf $TRINOTATE_HOME/auto/conf.txt --CPU  $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n```\n\n!!! warning \"Note\"\n    autoTrinotate analysis can require a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
