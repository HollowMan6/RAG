Batch queue system and interactive use\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/batch_jobs/interactive.html\n---\n\n# Batch job tutorial - Interactive jobs\n\n> In this tutorial we'll get familiar with the basic usage of the Slurm batch queue system at CSC\n- The goal is to learn how to request resources that **match** the needs of a job\n\nüí¨ A job consists of two parts: resource requests and the job step(s)\n\n‚òùüèª Examples are done on Puhti. If using the web interface, you can either open a login node shell and follow the steps below or, even better, open a compute node shell directly and skip to step 3.\n\nüí° The benefit of running an interactive session through the Puhti web interface is that the shell is *persistent*, i.e. the session will stay open and any programs started there will keep running even if you would happen to lose internet connection or close the browser tab.\n\n## Interactive jobs\n\nüí¨ In an interactive batch job, an interactive shell session is launched on a compute node.\n\n- For heavy interactive tasks one can request specific resources (time, memory, cores, disk).\n\nüí° You can also use tools with graphical user interfaces in an interactive shell session.\n\n- For such usage the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/) remote desktop often provides an improved experience.\n- Check also [how to use RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks in Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks/)\n\n### A simple interactive job\n\n1. Start an interactive job using one core for ten minutes:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive --account <project> --time 00:10:00         # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\nüí° You can list your projects with `csc-projects`\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. You should see that the command prompt (initial text on each row on the command-line) has changed from e.g. `puhti-login11` to e.g. `r07c51` which refers to a compute node.\n3. Once on the compute node, you can run commands directly from the command-line without `srun`. You can e.g. load the `python-data` module (e.g. for running Python scripts interactively on Puhti):\n\n```bash\nmodule load python-data\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Quit the interactive batch job with `exit`.\n\nüí¨ This way you can work interactively for an extended period, using e.g. lots of memory without creating load on the login nodes. Running heavy/long tasks on the login nodes is forbidden according to our [Usage Policy](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/).\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Note that above you asked only for 10 minutes of time.\n\n- Once that is up, you will be automatically logged out from the compute node.\n\nüí° From the command-line prompt you can see whether you're on a compute node (e.g. `r07c51`) or on the login node (e.g. `puhti-login12`).\n\n- Running `exit` on the login node will log you out from Puhti.\n\n## More information\n\nüí° Documentation at Docs CSC on [Interactive usage](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/)\n\nüí° [FAQ on CSC batch jobs](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/#batch-jobs) in Docs CSC\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLURM BATCH QUEUE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A system used at CSC for managing batch queue jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Center for Scientific Computing where the Slurm batch queue system is used)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computing environment at CSC that offers a web interface and compute node access for interactive jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI WEB INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A web interface provided by CSC for accessing Puhti's computing resources interactively)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSTUDIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An integrated development environment for R, mentioned in the context of using it on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, mentioned for use on Puhti)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLURM BATCH QUEUE SYSTEM<|>CSC<|>The Slurm batch queue system is utilized at CSC for job management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a computing environment provided by CSC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI WEB INTERFACE<|>PUHTI<|>The Puhti web interface is a tool for accessing Puhti's computing resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSTUDIO<|>PUHTI<|>RStudio can be used on Puhti for interactive sessions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS<|>PUHTI<|>Jupyter Notebooks can be used on Puhti for interactive sessions<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
