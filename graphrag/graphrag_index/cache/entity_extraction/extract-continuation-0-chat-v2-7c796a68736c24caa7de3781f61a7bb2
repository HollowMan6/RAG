For MPI analysis with multiple nodes, VTune produces a separate analysis for each node. More comprehensive MPI performance analysis is possible e.g. with [Intel Traceanalyzer](itac.md) or [Scalasca](scalasca.md).\n\n## Available\n\nPuhti: 2022.3\n\n## License\n\nUsage is possible for both academic and commercial purposes.\n\n## Usage\n\nIntel VTune Profiler is provided via the `intel-oneapi-vtune` module. One sets up the environment by loading the module:\n\n```\nmodule load intel-oneapi-vtune\n```\n\nIf you want to get source code level information, compile your code with the debugging information option `-g`.\n\n### Results collection\n\nPerformance analysis can be started either from VTune GUI, or with the VTune command line tool. In HPC systems\none uses normally the command line tool `vtune` within a bash job. The first analysis that we suggest to try is\n\"performance snapshot\". Here is a sample batch job script that can be used to collect it\n(please modify the script according to your application and project!):\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=VTune_example\n#SBATCH --account=<project_name>\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=20\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4000\n\n# set the number of threads based on --cpus-per-task\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\n\nmodule load intel-oneapi-vtune\n\nsrun vtune -collect performance-snapshot -- ./my_application\n```\n\nBy default, VTune writes the analysis results in a directory named `r000ps` within the current working directory,\nwhere the number is incremented automatically when multiple collections are run. The last two letters refer to the analysis\ntype. One can use also a custom results directory with the `-r results_dir_name` option.\n\nWhen analysing MPI applications (and running with multiple MPI tasks), one should add the `-trace-mpi` option:\n\n```\n#SBATCH ...\n\nsrun vtune -collect performance-snapshot --trace-mpi -r results_dir_name -- ./my_application\n```\n\nIn the case of MPI jobs the profiler will generate a separate directory for each node. In order to reduce the amount of data collected, one can onsider collecting data only for a subset of the tasks by launching VTune inside a wrapper script:\n\n```\n#SBATCH ...\n\nexport VTUNE_CL=\"vtune -collect performance-snapshot -trace-mpi -result-dir results_dir_name --\"\n\ncat << EOF > vtune_wrapper\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Launch VTune only for one MPI rank per node\nif [ $SLURM_LOCALID -eq 0 ]\nthen\nexec $VTUNE_CL \\$*\nelse\nexec \\$*\nfi\nEOF\n\nchmod +x ./vtune_wrapper\n\n\nsrun ./vtune_wrapper ./my_application\n\nrm -rf ./vtune_wrapper\n```\n\n### Analysing the results on command line\n\nThe command line tool can be used to create reports from collected results\nusing the `-report` option:\n\n```\nvtune -report summary -r results_dir_name\n```\n\nThe results are printed to standard output or to a file using `-report-output output_filename` option.\n\nVTune supports large number of different reports, *e.g.* \"hotspots\", \"hardware events\", and one can also\ncompare differences between two reports:\n\n```\nvtune -report hotspots -r results_dir_name_00 -r results_dir_name_01\n```\n\nBy default the report time is grouped by functions, however it is also possible to\nhave it grouped by source lines (`-group-by source-line`) or by module\n(`-group-by module`).\n\nFinally, it is possible to display the CPU time for call stacks\n(`-report callstacks`) or display a call tree and provide the CPU time for\neach function (`-report top-down`).\n\n\n### Analysing the results using GUI\n\nResults can be viewed using the `vtune-gui` application, which we recommend to launch via the [Desktop application](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md) in the [Puhti Web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi). You may also copy the full results directory\nto your workstation for local analysis.\n\nA particular result set can be opened by giving the name of the results directory as an argument to `vtune-gui`:\n\n```bash\nvtune-gui results_dir_name\n```\n\n#### Known issues\n\nSometimes `vtune-gui` fails to start with an error \"Failed to launch VTune Amplifier GUI...\". If that happens, one should kill\nall VTune processes that are left behind and try again:\n\n```\nkillall -9 -r vtune\nvtune-gui\n```\n\n## Further information\n\n- [VTune documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/vtune-profiler/user-guide/2024-1/overview.html)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTEL VTUNE PROFILER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intel VTune Profiler is a performance analysis tool for single core and threading performance, including MPI analysis for multiple nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEL TRACEANALYZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intel Traceanalyzer is a tool for comprehensive MPI performance analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALASCA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scalasca is a software tool that analyzes the performance of MPI applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a computing environment where Intel VTune Profiler is available)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEL VTUNE PROFILER<|>INTEL TRACEANALYZER<|>Intel VTune Profiler and Intel Traceanalyzer are both tools for performance analysis, with the latter being more focused on MPI performance<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEL VTUNE PROFILER<|>SCALASCA<|>Intel VTune Profiler and Scalasca are both used for analyzing the performance of applications, with Scalasca also focusing on MPI performance<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEL VTUNE PROFILER<|>PUHTI<|>Intel VTune Profiler is available for use in the Puhti computing environment<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
