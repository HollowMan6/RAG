If you know how to improve job performance,\nplease contribute to the list!\n\n## Limit unnecessary spreading of parallel tasks in Puhti\nOne of the limiting factors for strong scaling is the communication\nbetween tasks. Communication within a node is faster than between\nnodes. It is optimal to use as few nodes as possible.\n\nIf resources are requested simply by:\n```\n#SBATCH --ntasks=200\n```\nthe queuing system may spread them on tens of nodes (just a few cores each).\nThis will be very bad for the performance of the job, and will cause a lot of\n(unnecessary) communication in the system interconnect. If the performance of\nyour parallel jobs has decreased, this could be the reason.\nOverall, this should be avoided. This also\nfragments the system increasing queuing times for large jobs.\n\nThe best performance (fastest communication) can be achieved by requesting\nfull nodes:\n```\n#SBATCH --nodes=5\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40\n```\nSince Puhti is currently fragmented, requesting full nodes may mean longer queuing\ntime, but it may be regained by faster execution. If queuing times this way seem\nunacceptable, you can still limit the maximum number of nodes the job can spread on.\nFor example, limiting the 200 task job (which optimally fits on 5 nodes) to a maximum\nof 10 nodes, you could use:\n\n```\n#SBATCH --ntasks=200\n#SBATCH --nodes=5-10\n```\nSlurm will then allocate 200 cores from 5 to 10 nodes for your job.\n\n### How many nodes to allow?\nIf full nodes or the minimum is not suitable, it is probably best to try\nand monitor job performance. Choosing too many nodes will deteriorate\nperformance more than is gained by less queuing. Note also that overall this is lost\ncomputer capacity.\n\nPerhaps, a rule of thumb could be\nto set the upper limit to 2 or 3 times the number which would accommodate\nall tasks. With very large parallel jobs, even smaller is recommended as\ncommunication and the likelihood of one slow node in the allocation gets\nhigher and poor load balancing gets more likely. Anyway, large parallel jobs\nshould be run in Mahti.\n\n## Hybrid parallelization in Mahti\n\nMany HPC applications benefit from binding OpenMP threads to CPU cores\nwhich can be achieved by setting `export OMP_PLACES=cores` in the\nbatch job script.\n\nWhen starting new production runs it is also good\npractice to ensure correct thread affinity by adding to batch job\nscript\n```\nexport OMP_AFFINITY_FORMAT=\"Process %P level %L thread %0.3n affinity %A\"\nexport OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=true\n```\nThe runtime affinity will be printed to the standard error of the batch\njob. If the output shows that several processes/threads are bound to\nthe same core, *i.e.*\n```\nProcess 164433 level 1 thread 000 affinity 0\nProcess 164433 level 1 thread 001 affinity 0\n```\nthe performance might be deteriorated and one should check the settings\nin the batch script.\n\n\n## Perform a scaling test\nIt is important to make sure that your job can efficiently use\nall the allocated resources (cores). This needs to be verified for\neach new code and job type (different input) by a scaling test.\nScaling tests using full nodes apply only for jobs requesting\nfull nodes.\n\nIf possible, run a _short_ simulation with an increasing number of resources (cores)\nand evaluate how much faster your job gets. It should get at least\n1.5 times faster when you double the resources (cores). Don't allocate\nmore resources to your job that it can use efficiently. If scaling tests are not\npractical, first run your job with less resources, and note the performance.\nTry increasing the resources and confirm that the job (or a similar job)\ncompletes faster.\n\nNote, that not all codes or job types can be run in parallel. Confirm this first\nfor your code.\n\n## Mind your I/O - it can make a big difference\n\nIf your workload writes or reads a large number of small files then you may\nsee poor I/O performance even if the total volume is not that big. Please\nconsider the following items to mitigate potential bottlenecks:\n\n* Use local storage for especially AI workloads instead of scratch. Only some\n  nodes have [fast local disk](creating-job-scripts-puhti.md#local-storage),\n  but we've seen 10-fold performance improvement by switching to use it. Check\n  your performance: don't use the resource if it doesn't help.\n  [AI batch job example](../../support/tutorials/ml-data.md#fast-local-drive-puhti-and-mahti-only)\n* Investigate if you can choose how your application does I/O (e.g. OpenFoam\n  can use the collated file format) and don't write unnecessary information\n  on disk or do it too often (e.g. GROMACS with the `-v` flag should not be\n  used at CSC).\n* One way to avoid a large number of (small) files is to set up your complex\n  python or R based software in a singularity container. This also helps with\n  the [file number quotas](../disk.md) on projappl. Detailed examples on how\n  to do this are being written.\n\nFor applications writing and reading large files, I/O performance can be often\nimproved by proper Lustre settings:\n\n* If your application performs parallel I/O, set a proper stripe count\n  with `lfs setstripe -c`, more details in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer that provides resources for parallel tasks and job performance optimization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a supercomputer designed for large parallel jobs and hybrid parallelization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLURM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slurm is a workload manager used for submitting jobs to supercomputers like Puhti and Mahti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenMP is an API for multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>SLURM<|>Puhti uses Slurm as its workload manager for job submission and resource allocation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>OPENMP<|>Mahti recommends using OpenMP for binding threads to CPU cores for better performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>MAHTI<|>Both Puhti and Mahti are supercomputers that are part of the same computational infrastructure, with Mahti being recommended for larger parallel jobs<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
