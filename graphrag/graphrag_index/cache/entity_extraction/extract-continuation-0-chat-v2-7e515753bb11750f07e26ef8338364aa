Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 1\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/installing_hands-on_binary.html\n---\n\n# Installing binary applications\n\n> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that:\n  - You have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n  - Your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\nüí¨ In some cases software developers offer ready-made binary versions of their\nsoftware.\n\n- If the binary version runs, you don't need to compile the software yourself.\n\n‚òùüèª It should be noted that ready binary versions are typically not optimized\nfor CSC supercomputers.\n\n- The performance difference will depend on the code and on how the application\n  was compiled.\n- Often the difference is just a few percent, but in some cases it can be more\n  substantial.\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Especially all MPI codes need to be compiled on the machine they will be run\non to ensure correct operation.\n\n## Make the installation in your own folder in the `/projappl` directory of your project\n\n1. Move to the `/projappl` directory of your project:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd /projappl/<project>   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n2. If not done already, create your own folder under your project's `/projappl`\n   directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p $USER\n   ```\n\n3. Move to your folder:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd $USER\n   ```\n\n## Example: Installing the GCTA software\n\nüí¨ In this example we'll install the binary release of the GCTA software.\n\n1. Go to the [GCTA download page](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Download).\n2. Identify the Linux version.\n   - If several Linux versions are offered, try to find one with \"x86\" in the\n     name.\n   - If versions are offered by Linux distribution, try first the versions made\n     for CentOS or RedHat if present.\n   - Sometimes you may have to try different versions to find one that works.\n3. Here is the link for the Linux version. Download the `.zip` file by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/bin/gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64.zip\n   ```\n\n4. Unzip the file:\n\n   ```bash\n   unzip gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64.zip\n   ```\n\n5. The software is now ready to use, but you will have to tell the computer\n   where to find it.\n6. Trying just the following will result in a `command not found` error because\n   you are not accessing the right folder yet.\n\n   ```bash\n   gcta64\n   ```\n\n7. Try instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64/gcta64\n   ```\n\n8. Or:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64\n   ./gcta64\n   ```\n\n9. The result shows that the software runs.\n   - The error message is just about missing arguments, which is normal.\n\nüí° Instead of providing the full path in the command line, you can also add the\napplication to your `$PATH`.\n\n10. Move to `./gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64` if not there yet.\n11. Add the current working directory to `$PATH`:\n\n    ```bash\n    export PATH=$PWD:$PATH\n    ```\n\n12. You can now run the program from any directory simply with:\n\n    ```bash\n    gcta64\n    ```\n\n## Some notes\n\nüí° When adding paths to `$PATH`, always remember to *append* the current\n`$PATH`, otherwise some of your normal shell commands etc. will stop working.\n\n‚òùüèª To add paths automatically, you can add the `export` command to your\n`$HOME/.bashrc` file. Instead of `$PWD`, use the full path:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=/projappl/<project>/$USER/gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64:$PATH   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n```\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è If you make changes to your environment (e.g. edit `.bashrc`), it is possible\nthat there will be conflicts with applications pre-installed by CSC.\n\nüí≠ If you encounter problems after modifying your environment, it is possible\nto restore it to the default state permanently or temporarily using the\n[`csc-env` command](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a CSC supercomputer that users can access for various computing tasks, requiring a user account and project access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides IT support and resources for science across Finland, including supercomputing and data management services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCTA SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GCTA is a software tool for genetic data analysis, available in binary form for installation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is a service provided by CSC, requiring an account and project access to use<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GCTA SOFTWARE<|>PUHTI<|>The GCTA software can be installed and run on the Puhti supercomputer<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
