This is the recommended value for SSH, but in case you need to overwrite the file, you will need to give also write permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem`.\n\n\nBefore using the newly created key, you should protect it with a passphrase:\n\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem\nssh-keygen -p -f .ssh/keyname.pem\nchmod 400 ~/.ssh/keyname.pem\n```\n\n### Windows (PowerShell)\n\nIn **Windows** environments it is recommended to use PowerShell. The process is very similar\n\n```PowerShell\nmkdir ~/.ssh\nmv yourkey.pem ~/.ssh/\n```\n\nBefore using the newly created key, you should protect it with a passphrase:\n\n```PowerShell\nssh-keygen.exe -p -f yourkey.pem\n```\n\nThen, still from PowerShell, you can use the `ssh` command to connect to your machine, in the same way it is done from Linux or Mac.\n\n#### Windows (Putty)\n\nIf your copy of Windows does not have the _ssh_ command installed, it is also possible to use _Putty_.\n\nThis is done by using the _puttygen_ tool to load your private key (.pem) and save it in the (password protected) .ppk format which Putty can use.\n\n1. Download _Putty_ and _puttygen_, which are available at <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>.\n\n1. Run _puttygen_ and load the key you downloaded (it should be in the Downloads page).\n\n    ![Putty Gen](../../img/putty-load.png)\n\n1. Set a password to the key. This is not compulsory, but advised.\n\n1. Save the key in _ppk_ format, this is the default Putty format for keys.\n\n    ![Saved](../../img/putty-saved-ppk.png)\n\nNow we can use this new in Putty to connect to a Virtual Machine.\n\n1. Run _putty_ and load the ssh key. Go to **Connection > SSH > Auth** and under **Private key file for authentication**, use the **Browse...** button to select the proper .ppk file.\n\n    ![Private key file for authentication](../../img/putty-key-file-authentication.png)\n\n1. Once the key is loaded, you will save the session. Go to the **Session** section and under **Saved Sessions** write the name of the new session and click save.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH, Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families developed by Microsoft)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and the associated scripting language)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUTTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Putty is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUTTYGEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puttygen is a key generator tool for creating pairs of public and private SSH keys)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>UNIX<|>SSH is recommended to be used with Unix systems with specific permissions for security<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>WINDOWS<|>SSH can also be used in Windows environments, indicating interoperability<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>WINDOWS<|>PowerShell is recommended for use in Windows environments for SSH key management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUTTY<|>WINDOWS<|>Putty is used as an alternative in Windows for SSH connections when the ssh command is not installed<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUTTYGEN<|>PUTTY<|>Puttygen is used to generate keys for Putty in a specific format (.ppk)<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
