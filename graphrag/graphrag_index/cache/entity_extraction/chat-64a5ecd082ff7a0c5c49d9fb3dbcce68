Here we give a very brief overview of some of the most important abstractions, but we highly recommend that you read the concept documentation for Kubernetes and OpenShift as well:\n\n* [Kubernetes concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/)\n* [OpenShift concepts](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/welcome/index.html)\n\nThese abstractions are objects, persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. These entities are used to represent the desired state of the project (also called namespace in Kubernetes). Most of the objects are common to both plain Kubernetes and OpenShift, but OpenShift also introduces some of its own extra objects.\n\n![Kubernetes full picture](../img/Kubernetes.drawio.svg)\n\n## Kubernetes concepts\n\n### Namespace\n\nEvery Kubernetes object is created inside a **Namespace**. It is just a sandbox where all the other objects are \ncontained and separated from objects belonging to other namespaces. In Openshift they are referred as **Projects**. \nThe two names (project and namespace) are very common words in computing so referring to them can sometimes be confusing. \nIn order to create a project, please go to the [Creating a project](usage/projects_and_quota.md#creating-a-project) documentation.\n\n### Pod\n\n**Pods** contain one or more containers that run applications. It is the basic\nunit in Kubernetes: when you run a workload in Kubernetes, it always runs in a\npod. Kubernetes handles scheduling these pods on multiple servers. Pods can\ncontain volumes of different types for accessing data. Each pod has its own IP\naddress shared by all containers in the pod, this IP address may change if the Pod gets killed and recreated. In the most typical\ncase, a pod contains one container and perhaps one or a few different volumes.\n\nPods are intended to be _expendable_, i.e. they may be killed at any time and a \"cloud native\" application must be \nable to continue working and show no sign of interruption to the user. It must recover automatically. Any data that \nneeds to persist after a pod is killed should be stored on a [persistent volume](storage/persistent.md) attached to the pod.\n\n![Pod](../img/pods.png)\n\nThe abstractions in Kubernetes/OpenShift are described using YAML or JSON. YAML\nand JSON are so-called data serialization languages that provide a way to\ndescribe key value pairs and data structures such as lists in a way that is easy to\nread for both humans and computers. An example of what the\nrepresentation of a pod looks like in YAML:\n\n```yaml\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: name\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: webserver\n    image: cscfi/nginx-okd\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 8080\n      protocol: TCP\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: website-content-volume\n      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\n  volumes:\n  - name: website-content-volume\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: web-content-pvc\n```\n\nThe above YAML representation describes a web server pod that has one container\nand one volume and exposes the port 8080. You could put this snippet of text\nin a file and create a pod that runs NGINX by feeding that file to the Kubernetes API.\n\n### Service\n\nPod IP addresses are not predictable. If a pod is replaced as part of normal\noperations such as an update, the IP address of the new pod can be different. It is\nalso typical to have multiple pods serving the same content, in which case there\nare several of these unpredictable IP addresses to point to. Thus, pods alone\nare not enough to provide a predictable way to access an application.\n\nA **service** provides a stable virtual IP, a port and a DNS name for one or\nmore pods. They act as **load balancers**, directing traffic to a group of pods\nthat all serve the same application.\n\n![Service](../img/service.png)\n\n*`service.yaml`*:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: app\n  name: service-name\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - name: 8080-tcp\n    port: 8080\n    protocol: TCP\n    targetPort: 8080\n  selector:\n    app: app\n  sessionAffinity: None\n  type: ClusterIP\nstatus:\n  loadBalancer: {}\n```\n\n### ReplicaSet\n\nA **ReplicaSet** ensures that _n_ copies of a pod are running. If one of the\npods dies, the ReplicaSet ensures that a new one is created in its place. They\nare typically not used on their own but rather as part of a **Deployment**\n(explained next).\n\n![ReplicaSet](../img/replicaset.png)\n\n### Deployment\n\n**Deployments** manage rolling updates for an application. They typically\ncontain a ReplicaSet and several pods. If you make a change that requires an\nupdate such as switching to a newer image for pod containers, the deployment\nensures the change is made in a way that there are no service interruptions. It\nwill perform a rolling update to kill all pods one by one and replace them with\nnewer ones while making sure that end user traffic is directed towards working\npods at all times.\n\n![Deployment](../img/deployment.png)\n\n### InitContainer\n\n_InitContainer_ is a container in a pod that is intended run to completion before\nthe main containers are started. Data from the init containers can be\ntransferred to the main container using e.g\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
