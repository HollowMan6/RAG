However, you will still have access to LUMI\n    and the data stored on it for 90 days. You are responsible of the backup any\n    data you may still need within this 90-day period. After the 90 days, the\n    data will be deleted.\n\n    If you start a new project within 90 days of your previous project's end and\n    wish to reuse the data, you are responsible for transferring the data from\n    one project to the other.\n\n\nOn LUMI you have access to network file system storage based on the\n[LUMI-P][lumip] and [LUMI-F][lumif] hardware partitions, as well as to the object storage on [LUMI-O][lumio]. \nThe use of storage is billed according to the [billing policy](../runjobs/lumi_env/billing.md#storage-billing).\n\n\n## Where to store data?\n\n=== \"User home\"\n\n    Each user has a home directory (`$HOME`) that can contain up to\n    20 GB of data. It is intended to store user configuration files and personal\n    data. The user home directory is purged once the user account expires. However, LUMI, and therefore the user home directory, is not accessible if the user is not a member of an active project, even though the user has still a valid account on LUMI.\n\n=== \"Project persistent\"\n\n    Persistent storage intended to share data amongst the members of a project.\n    You can see this disk area as the project home directory. Typically, this\n    space is used to share applications and libraries compiled for the project.\n    The project persistent storage is located at\n    `/project/project_<project-number>`. The project persistent directory is\n    purged once the project expires.\n\n=== \"Project scratch\"\n\n    Temporary storage for input, output, or checkpoint data of your application.\n    When running jobs on LUMI, this is the main storage you should use for your\n    disk I/O needs.\n    \n    You are not supposed to use the scratch space as long-term storage. The \n    scratch file system is a temporary storage space. Files that have not been\n    accessed will be **purged after 90 days**.\n\n=== \"Project flash\"\n\n    A high performance variant of project scratch. Use this when running jobs\n    on LUMI that need very fast disk I/O operations. Note the difference in\n    billing of the project scratch and project fast as detailed on the\n    [billing page][billing].\n\n    The project flash space is only meant for very short term file storage.\n    Files that have not been accessed will be **purged after 30 days**.\n\n## LUMI network file system disk storage areas\n\nOn LUMI, there are several network-based disk storage areas. An overview is\nprovided in the tables below. Please familiarize yourself with the\ncharacteristics of the hardware partitions before using the different storage\nareas.\n\n|                            | Path                       | Intended use                                                     | Hardware partition used |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **User<br> home**          | `/users/<username>`        | User home directory for<br> personal and configuration files     | [LUMI-P][lumip]         |\n| **Project<br> persistent** | `/project/<project>`       | Project home directory for<br> shared project files              | [LUMI-P][lumip]         |\n| **Project<br> scratch**    | `/scratch/<project>`       | Temporary storage for<br> input, output or checkpoint data       | [LUMI-P][lumip]         |\n| **Project<br> flash**      | `/flash/<project>`         | High performance temporary<br> storage for input and output data | [LUMI-F][lumif]         |\n\n\n|                           | Quota | Max files | Expandable            | Retention        | Billing<br>rate |\n|---------------------------|-------|-----------|-----------------------| -----------------|-----------------|\n| **User<br>home**          | 20 GB | 100k      | No                    | User lifetime    | NA              |\n| **Project<br>persistent** | 50 GB | 100k      | Yes,<br> up to 500GB  | Project lifetime | 1x              |\n| **Project<br>scratch**    | 50 TB | 2000k     | Yes,<br> up to 500TB  | 90 days          | 1x              |\n| **Project<br>fast**       |  2 TB | 1000k     | Yes,<br> up to 100TB  | 30 days          | 10x             |\n\n|\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a storage system offering various storage solutions including LUMI-P, LUMI-F, and LUMI-O on different hardware partitions)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-P<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hardware partition on LUMI providing network file system storage)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-F<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hardware partition on LUMI offering high performance storage solutions)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI-O<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Object storage solution on LUMI)##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER HOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Directory for user configuration files and personal data on LUMI, with a quota of 20 GB)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT PERSISTENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Persistent storage on LUMI for sharing data among project members, with a base quota of 50 GB)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT SCRATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Temporary storage on LUMI for application input, output, or checkpoint data, with a base quota of 50 TB)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT FLASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>High performance temporary storage on LUMI for fast disk I/O operations, with a base quota of 2 TB)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-P<|>USER HOME<|>User home directories are located on the LUMI-P hardware partition<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-P<|>PROJECT PERSISTENT<|>Project persistent storage is located on the LUMI-P hardware partition<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-P<|>PROJECT SCRATCH<|>Project scratch storage is located on the LUMI-P hardware partition<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI-F<|>PROJECT FLASH<|>Project flash storage is located on the LUMI-F hardware partition<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-P<|>LUMI-P is part of the LUMI storage system offerings<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-F<|>LUMI-F is part of the LUMI storage system offerings<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LUMI-O<|>LUMI-O is part of the LUMI storage system offerings<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
