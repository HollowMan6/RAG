In Allas, the amount of data stored consumes billing units.\n\nSee [Billing and Quotas](./introduction.md#billing-and-quotas)\n\n### Bucket\n\nA _bucket_ is a container for objects that may also include metadata describing the bucket.\n\n### Checksum\n\nA _checksum_ is a hashed string computed of an object to observe whether the object has changed (data integrity).\nYou can display the checksum using the command `md5sum`.\n\n### Client\n\nThe _client software_ is used to access an object storage service, such as Allas. There are three types of clients:\n\n * Web browser based access via the [OpenStack Horizon web interface](./using_allas/web_client.md) for basic graphical usage.\n * Command-line clients such as [Swift](./using_allas/swift_client.md) and [s3cmd](./using_allas/s3_client.md) for power users.\n * _Programmable interface_ (API) for those who integrate software.\n\n### Metadata\n\n_Metadata_ describes an object or bucket. It can be used to search for objects.\nIt is used via _key-value_ pairs (for example, name: John).\n\n### Object lifecycle\n\n_Object lifecycle_ Can be configured to automatically remove objects from Allas. Lifecycle is configured in the bucket level, where multiple expiration periods can be defined. Lifecycle is applied to the objects in the bucket based on their matching tags and/or prefixes. See an example in the [s3 client tool documentation](./using_allas/s3_client.md#setting-up-an-object-lifecycle)\n\n### Object storage\n\n_Object storage_ refers to a computer data storage that manages data as objects instead of files or blocks. Typically, an object consists of the data itself, metadata and a unique identifier. In general, the data can be anything, e.g. an image or audio.\n\n### OpenStack\n\nThe _OpenStack cloud management middleware_ can be used to access Allas.\nThe [OpenStack Horizon web interface](./using_allas/web_client.md) offers some basic functionalities for data management in Allas.\n\nSee [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) for more information.\n\n### Pseudo folder\n\nBuckets cannot contain other buckets. You can, however, use so-called _pseudo folders_.\n\nIf an object's name contains a forward slash `/`, it is interpreted as a folder separator. These are shown as folder listings when accessing the data via the web interface. These pseudo folders are automatically added if you upload whole folders using a command line client.\n\nFor example, if you add two objects\n```bash\nfishes/salmon.png\nfishes/bass.png\n```\nin a bucket, listing the bucket will display a folder called _fishes_ and the two files in it.\n\n## Quota\n\nThe _Allas quota_ defines the maximum amount of data (capacity) the project is allowed to store in Allas.\n\nSee [Billing and quotas](./introduction.md#billing-and-quotas)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACCESS CONTROL LIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A mechanism in Allas used to control users' access to buckets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLING UNIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Describes the consumption of computing and storage resources in CSC systems, affecting data storage in Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUCKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A container in Allas for objects, which may include metadata describing the bucket)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHECKSUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hashed string computed of an object to observe data integrity, can be displayed using md5sum command)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIENT SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software used to access object storage services like Allas, includes web browser access, command-line clients, and APIs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METADATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Describes objects or buckets in Allas, used for searching via key-value pairs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OBJECT LIFECYCLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Configuration in Allas for automatic removal of objects from buckets based on tags/prefixes and expiration periods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OBJECT STORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A data storage managing data as objects, includes the data, metadata, and a unique identifier)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud management middleware used to access Allas, offers basic data management functionalities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSEUDO FOLDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Used in Allas to simulate folder structure within buckets, automatically added when uploading folders using command line clients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUOTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Defines the maximum amount of data allowed to be stored in Allas for a project)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
