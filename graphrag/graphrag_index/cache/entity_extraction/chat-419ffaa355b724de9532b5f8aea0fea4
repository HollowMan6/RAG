Before the cleaning has\nbegun, each project that is part of the clean-up will have a file named `path_summary.txt`.\nIn special cases where a project is exempt from the upcoming cleaning, or requires more time to\ntransfer files, the administrators will rename the file to something else, usually\n`path_summary.txt-later-delete`. Once a project has been processed by the automated cleaning,\nthe file will be renamed to `path_summary.txt-stashed`. These files are still readable to projects,\nso that it is possible to refer to the list also after the cleaning is performed.\nThe previous round's files will be archived when the next round of cleaning is about to begin.\nYou can check whether your project's purge list has been updated recently by checking its last\nmodification date. In the example below, the file is a few months old, so it is clearly from\nthe prior round of cleaning:\n\n```bash\n$ stat -c %y /scratch/purge_lists/project_2001659/path_summary.txt-stashed\n2023-05-23 00:35:28.000000000 +0300\n$ date +%F\n2023-08-04\n```\n\nAnother file which is put into each project's `purge_lists` directory is the `total_size.txt` file.\nThis file contains a precalculated size estimate based on the numbers inside the `path_summary.txt`\nfiles. This file exists for every project, and is created automatically when the purge lists are\ngenerated. The file might look like this:\n\n```bash\n$ cat /scratch/purge_lists/project_2001659/total_size.txt\nTotal size: 798343125192 bytes = 743.515 GiB = 0.726 TiB\n```\n\nWith this information, you are able to estimate how much time might be required to back up the\ndata elsewhere, if you want to keep everything on the purge list outside of Puhti's `scratch` file\nsystem.\nThe file system tools which CSC uses to generate the list of files to remove will output files\nwhich are quite verbose and difficult to read. By using the LCleaner tool described in the next section,\nusers can get the relevant information in a more user-friendly format.\n\n## Using LCleaner to check which files will be automatically removed\n\nLCleaner is a tool developed by CSC, which is intended to help you to discover what files your\nproject has that have been targeted for automatic removal.\n\nRun `lcleaner --help` on the login nodes to see what options LCleaner supports.\n\n### LCleaner examples\n\n#### Check if your project has a path_summary.txt file\n\nThe first thing to check, is whether your project indeed has a `path_summary.txt` file.\nAll projects don't automatically have one, only the ones which have something to clean up.\n\n```bash\n# Check if your project has a path_summary.txt file\nmy_project=\"project_2001659\" # Replace with your own project name\nls \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/\"\n# Or if you are in an FMI project on Puhti:\nls \"/fmi/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/\"\n```\n\nIf you see a `path_summary.txt` file in the directory, read ahead to discover what files\nare on the list. However, if you find a file named `nothing-to-remove-for-your-project`,\nyour project doesn't have anything that will be automatically removed.\n\nIf you want a quick, copy-pasteable solution, use the small script below:\n\n```bash\n# Check all of the projects you belong to in one go:\n\nfor g in $(/usr/bin/groups) ; do\n  if [ -d \"/scratch/$g\" -a ! -L \"/scratch/$g\" ]; then\n    dir=\"/scratch/purge_lists/$g\" ;\n  elif [ -d \"/fmi/scratch/$g\" ]; then\n    dir=\"/fmi/scratch/purge_lists/$g\";\n  else\n    continue;\n  fi ;\n  echo -n \"- Project '$g': \";\n  if [ ! -d \"${dir:?}\" ]; then\n    echo \"doesn't have a purge_lists subdirectory. No files will be removed.\";\n    continue;\n  fi ;\n  if [ -f \"${dir:?}/path_summary.txt\" ]; then\n    echo \"has files that will be removed.\" ;\n  elif [ -f \"${dir:?}/nothing-to-remove-for-your-project\" ]; then\n    echo \"is not included in the automatic cleaning.\";\n  else\n    echo \"is unclear, based on this script. Check with Service desk what to do.\";\n  fi ;\ndone\n```\n\n#### List your files\n\nTo get a simple list of all file paths in your purge list, simply give the `path_summary.txt` file\npath as an argument:\n\n```bash\n# List all files in your purge list:\nlcleaner \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n```\n\nIf your `path_summary.txt` is big (over 100 MB in size), it may take some time to execute the tool.\nYou can save time and resources by saving the result into an output file:\n\n```bash\n# List all files in your purge list into an output file in your home folder:\nlcleaner --out-file ~/purge_list \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\"\n\n# Alternatively, you can redirect the standard output with the bash shell:\nlcleaner \"/scratch/purge_lists/${my_project:?}/path_summary.txt\" > ~/purge_list\n\n# Check the output with less, or your preferred text editor\nless ~/purge_list\n```\n\nIf you want to search for a specific file or directory, you can use `grep` to achieve that.\nYou can either\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
