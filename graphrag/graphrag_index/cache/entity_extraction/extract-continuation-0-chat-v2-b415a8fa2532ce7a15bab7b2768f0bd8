Most macOS and Linux systems have a server program for the X\nwindow system (X11) installed by default.\n\nTo enable displaying graphics over SSH, use the `-X` (X11 forwarding) or `-Y`\n(trusted X11 forwarding) option when launching the SSH client:\n\n```bash\nssh -X <username>@<host>.csc.fi\n```\n\nFor more information about the X11 forwarding options, run `man ssh` in the\nterminal.\n\n## Generating SSH keys\n\nOn macOS and Linux, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command-line utility for\ngenerating SSH keys:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519\n```\n\nYou will be asked to type a passphrase. Please choose a secure passphrase. It\nshould be at least 8 characters long and contain numbers, letters and special\ncharacters. Never leave the passphrase empty!\n\n!!! note \"Using SSH keys\"\n    See the page on [setting up SSH keys](ssh-keys.md) for general\n    information about using SSH keys for authentication.\n\n## Copying public key to supercomputer\n\nThe recommended way to copy a public key to a supercomputer is\n[through the My CSC customer portal](ssh-keys.md#adding-public-key-in-my-csc).\nAlternatively, you can use the `ssh-copy-id` utility:\n\n```bash\nssh-copy-id <username>@<host>.csc.fi\n```\n\nYou will be asked for your CSC password (not the passphrase for the SSH key).\nSubsequent logins using the SSH key pair will ask for the passphrase.\n\n## Authentication agent\n\nTo avoid having to type your passphrase every time you connect to a CSC\nsupercomputer, the `ssh-agent` utility can hold your keys in memory. The\nprogram's behavior depends on your system:\n\n- On Linux systems, `ssh-agent` is typically configured and run automatically at\n  login and requires no additional actions on your part.\n- On macOS systems, you should add the following lines to the `~/.ssh/config`\n  file:\n\n    ```text\n    Host *\n        UseKeychain no\n        AddKeysToAgent yes\n    ```\n\nFor more information about `ssh-agent`, see the\n[relevant SSH Academy tutorial](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/agent).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENSSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenSSH provides the client software used for creating secure connections to CSC supercomputers on macOS and Linux systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is an organization that provides supercomputing resources, and users can connect to its supercomputers like Puhti and Mahti using SSH)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system for Apple computers, mentioned in the context of using SSH to connect to CSC supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an operating system mentioned in the context of using SSH to connect to CSC supercomputers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>X WINDOW SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>X Window System is a windowing system for bitmap displays, mentioned for its server program installed by default on most macOS and Linux systems to display graphics over SSH)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH-KEYGEN<|>EVENT<|>ssh-keygen is a command-line utility for generating SSH keys on macOS and Linux systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY CSC CUSTOMER PORTAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>My CSC Customer Portal is a platform for CSC users to manage their accounts and public keys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH-AGENT<|>EVENT<|>ssh-agent is a utility that holds SSH keys in memory to avoid having to type the passphrase every time a connection is made to a CSC supercomputer)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSSH<|>CSC<|>OpenSSH client software is used to connect to CSC supercomputers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH-KEYGEN<|>CSC<|>ssh-keygen is used to generate SSH keys for authenticating with CSC supercomputers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY CSC CUSTOMER PORTAL<|>CSC<|>My CSC Customer Portal is used by CSC users to manage their public keys for SSH authentication<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH-AGENT<|>CSC<|>ssh-agent utility is used to manage SSH keys for connections to CSC supercomputers<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
