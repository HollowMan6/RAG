LUMI, you might need to set\nenvironment variable `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=hsn` and some other settings\nto get optimal performance. See the [PyTorch example in the LUMI\ndocumentation for all the environment\nvariables](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/packages/pytorch/#example). These\nare set automatically in the CSC PyTorch module.\n\n\nIf you are converting an old PyTorch script there are a few steps that you need to do:\n\n1. Initialize with `init_process_group()`, for example:\n\n    ```python\n    import torch.distributed as dist\n\n    dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')\n\n    local_rank = int(os.environ['LOCAL_RANK'])\n    torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)\n    ```\n\n2. Wrap your model with `DistributedDataParallel`:\n\n    ```python\n    from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel\n\n    model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[local_rank])\n    ```\n\n3. Use `DistributedSampler` in your `DataLoader`:\n\n    ```python\n    from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler\n\n    train_sampler = DistributedSampler(train_dataset)\n    train_loader = DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, sampler=train_sampler, ...)\n    ```\n\n\nA fully working example for Puhti can be found in our [`pytorch-ddp-examples`\nrepository](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples):\n\n- [mnist_ddp.py](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples/blob/master/mnist_ddp.py)\n  shows the Python code for training a simple CNN model on MNIST data\n  using PyTorch DDP\n- [run-ddp-gpu4.sh](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples/blob/master/run-ddp-gpu4.sh)\n  contains the Slurm script to run the training on 4 GPUs on a single\n  node\n- [run-ddp-gpu8.sh](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples/blob/master/run-ddp-gpu8.sh)\n  shows the same for two full nodes, with a total of 8 GPUs\n\n\n### PyTorch Lightning with DDP\n\n[PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) is a popular higher-level\nframework designed to make using PyTorch easier. Running multi-GPU and\nmulti-node jobs with Lightning is quite easy. If you wish to convert\nyour existing PyTorch script to Lightning, we will refer you to the\n[official PyTorch Lightning\ndocumentation](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/).\n\n\nWe recommend using DistributedDataParallel (DDP) for multi-GPU and\nmulti-node usage. You just need to add these options to your Lightning\nTrainer:\n\n```python\ntrainer = pl.Trainer(devices=args.gpus,\n                     num_nodes=args.nodes,\n                     accelerator='gpu',\n                     strategy='ddp',\n                     ...)\n```\n\nYou need to give appropriate values for `devices` (number of GPUs *per\nnode*) and `num_nodes`. We suggest giving these are command line arguments:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n\n    parser.add_argument('--gpus', default=1, type=int,\n                        help='number of GPUs per node')\n    parser.add_argument('--nodes', default=1, type=int,\n                        help='number of nodes')\n    # any other command line arguments here\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n```\n\nPyTorch Lightning Slurm script for single node using\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer that provides computational resources for scientific research and development projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a supercomputer used for scientific research, part of the CSC's range of high-performance computing resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd. is a Finnish center of expertise that provides high-quality ICT services for research, education, culture, public administration, and enterprises, to help them thrive and benefit society at large)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH LIGHTNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PyTorch Lightning is a high-level framework that helps researchers and developers build PyTorch models more easily and efficiently)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a supercomputer that offers powerful computational resources for various research and development projects)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>LUMI<|>LUMI provides computational resources that support PyTorch for scientific research<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>MAHTI<|>Mahti supports PyTorch for high-performance computing tasks in scientific research<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti supports PyTorch for various computational research and development projects<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH LIGHTNING<|>PYTORCH<|>PyTorch Lightning is built on top of PyTorch to simplify model development and training<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>LUMI<|>CSC provides support and resources for LUMI, one of its high-performance computing resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MAHTI<|>CSC manages Mahti, offering it as part of its range of high-performance computing resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>CSC operates Puhti, providing it as a computational resource for research and development<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
