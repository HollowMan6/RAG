It is intended for situations where you\nwant to make a copy of a file visible on the internet for a short while e.g. for copying to another platform shared with a co-worker.\n\na-flip copies a file to Allas into a bucket that can be publicly accessed. Thus, anyone with the address (URL) of the \nuploaded data object can read and download the data with a web browser or tools like _wget_ and _curl_. \na-flip works similarly to a-publish with some differences:\n\n1. Only the predefined bucket name (_username-projectNumber_-flip) can be used.\n1. Upon execution, it checks the content of the flip bucket and deletes objects that are older than two days.\n\nThe basic syntax:\n```text\na-flip file_name\n```\nThe file is uploaded to the bucket _username-projectNumber_-flip. The URL of the uploaded object:\n```text\nhttps://a3s.fi/username-projectNumber-flip/file_name\n```\n\n\n## a-find<a name=\"a-find\"></a>\n\nThe `a-find` command lists and locates data that has been uploaded to Allas using `a-put`.\n\nThe basic syntax:\n```text\na-find query_term\n```\n\nThe query term is compared to the names and original paths of the files that have been uploaded to\nAllas, and matching objects are reported (but not downloaded).\n\nThe query term is processed as a regular repression where some characters, e.g. period (.), have a special meaning.\nThe same regular expression syntax is used with e.g. the _grep_, _awk_ and _sed_ commands.\nThe most commonly occurring special characters:\n\n- Period (**.**) is used to define any single character.\n- **^** marks the beginning of a line.\n- **$** marks the end of a line.\n- **[ ]** matches any character inside the brackets. For example, [abc] would match a, b or c.\n- **[^ ]** matches any character except the characters inside the brackets.   \n    For example, [^abc] would select all rows that contain characters than are not a, b and c.\n- ** * ** matches zero or more of the preceding characters or expressions.\n    `\\{n,m\\}` matches n to m occurrences of the preceding characters or expressions.\n\nOptions:\n\n\n- **-a**, **--all**  By default only the standard buckets, used by a-put, are searched. Option `--all` defines that all the buckets of the project will be included in the search.\n- **-f**, **--files** List the names of matching files inside the objects in addition to the object names.\n- **-p**,**--project _project_ID_** Search matches in the buckets of the defined project instead of the currently configured project. \n- **-b**, **--bucket _bucket_name_** By default, all default buckets used by `a-put` are searched. The option _-bucket_ allows you to specify a single bucket for the search. Use this option also in cases where you have stored data in a bucket with a non-standard name.\n- **-s**, **-silent** Print only object names and the number of hits. If the _-f_ option is used, print the object name and the matching file names on one row.\n\n## a-info shows information about an uploaded dataset<a name=\"a-info\"></a>\n                             \nThe command `a-info` allows you to get information about a dataset that has been uploaded to Allas using `a-put`.   \n\n```text\na-info bucket/object_name\n```           \nIf you execute this command without any object name, it will list basic information of all of the objects of the current project and a total summary about how much data and objects your Allas project contains.\n```text\na-info \n```   \n\n                             \n## a-get retrieves stored data<a name=\"a-get\"></a>\n\nThis tool is used to download data that has been uploaded\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a data storage and management service that allows users to upload, download, and manage data objects in buckets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-PUBLISH<|>EVENT<|>A command used in Allas to upload files to a public bucket, making them accessible via a public URL)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-DELETE<|>EVENT<|>A command used in Allas to remove objects from storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-FLIP<|>EVENT<|>A tool in Allas for making files temporarily available over the internet, with automatic deletion of objects older than two days)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-FIND<|>EVENT<|>A command in Allas to list and locate data that has been uploaded, using query terms and regular expression syntax)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-INFO<|>EVENT<|>A command in Allas that provides information about datasets uploaded, including a summary of data and objects in a project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-GET<|>EVENT<|>A tool used in Allas to download data that has been previously uploaded)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-PUBLISH<|>ALLAS<|>A-publish is a command used within the Allas service to make data publicly accessible<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-DELETE<|>ALLAS<|>A-delete is a command used within the Allas service to remove data objects<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-FLIP<|>ALLAS<|>A-flip is a tool provided by Allas for temporary data sharing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-FIND<|>ALLAS<|>A-find is a command used within the Allas service to locate uploaded data<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-INFO<|>ALLAS<|>A-info is a command used within the Allas service to get information about uploaded datasets<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-GET<|>ALLAS<|>A-get is a tool used within the Allas service to download data<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
