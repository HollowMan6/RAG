To use newer version of Picard, load the `picard` module.\n\nTo get a summary of available tools:\n```bash\npicard\n```\n\nPlease note that in the Picard manual commands start with \"java -jar\npicard.jar\". In Puhti it is easiest to run Picard through a wrapper script,\nso substitute that with just `picard`.\n\nExample:\n```bash\npicard SamToFASTQ I=input.bam FASTQ=output.fastq\n```\n\nBy default picard can use up to 8 GBÂ  of memory. If your analysis task\nrequires more memory, you can launch picard with commands, `picard16`, `picard32`\nand `picard64` that reserve 16, 32 or 64 GB of memory respectively.\n\nExample:\n```bash\npicard16 SamToFASTQ I=input.bam FASTQ=output.fastq\n```\n\nIf you need to specify Java options for Picard you can use `java -jar $PICARD`.\n\nExample:\n```bash\njava -Xmx128g -jar $PICARD  SamToFASTQ I=input.bam FASTQ=output.fastq\n```\n\n\n## More information\n\n-   [Picard home page](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)\n-   [Detailed tool documentation](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
