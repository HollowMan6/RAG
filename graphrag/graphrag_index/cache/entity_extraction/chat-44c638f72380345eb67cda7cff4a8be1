See more details\n        in [LUMI Docs](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumig/).\n\n### Performance notes\n\n#### Mahti\n\nThe following table shows the total execution time (in seconds) of the\n[H2O-256 benchmark](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/benchmarks/QS/H2O-256.inp)\non Mahti using `cp2k/2024.2`. The column headers show how many OpenMP threads\nwere used per MPI task.\n\n|CPU nodes|1     |2     |4         |8     |\n|:-------:|:----:|:----:|:--------:|:----:|\n|1        |197.35|164.80|169.66    |192.07|\n|2        |111.95|107.78|**101.52**|117.60|\n|4        |82.74 |72.12 |72.00     |97.97 |\n\n* For 256 water molecules, the best efficiency is obtained with 2 full nodes,\n  32 MPI tasks per node, and 4 OpenMP threads per task. For this system it is\n  not efficient to scale beyond 2 nodes (256 CPU cores).\n* Hybrid parallelism is often efficient – choose tasks and threads so that they\n  add up to 128 (physical) cores available per node (or up to 40 on Puhti).\n* Test the optimal run parameters for your model system and method.\n* Using the ELPA diagonalization library instead of ScaLAPACK may significantly\n  accelerate calculations that require large matrix diagonalizations (even up\n  to 50% depending on the system). A good example are metallic systems that may\n  converge poorly with the orbital transformation (OT) method and thus demand a\n  standard diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham matrix.\n\n#### LUMI\n\nOnly certain CPU cores are directly linked to a specific GPU on LUMI, so to\nmaximize multi-GPU performance, it is important to ensure that CPU cores are\nbound to the GPUs accordingly. The full GPU node example above takes care of\nthis, and also excludes the first core of each group of 8 cores linked to a\ngiven GCD. These are reserved for the operating system to reduce noise, meaning\nthat there are only 56 cores available per node.\n\n!!! error \"Note\"\n    Please note that CPU-GPU binding only works when reserving full nodes by\n    running in the `standard-g` partition or by using the `--exclusive` flag.\n    See more details in LUMI Docs:\n    [LUMI-G hardware](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumig/),\n    [LUMI-G examples](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumig-job/),\n    [GPU binding](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/distribution-binding/#gpu-binding)\n\nThe following plot shows the total execution time of the\n[linear-scaling SCF benchmark](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/tree/master/benchmarks/QS_DM_LS)\n(2048 water molecules) on Mahti (CPU), LUMI-C and LUMI-G. When CPU-GPU binding\nis properly done (see example above), LUMI-G is about twice as performant as\nMahti/LUMI-C when comparing GPU nodes vs. CPU nodes. Since not all routines of\nCP2K have been ported to GPUs, make sure to always check the performance and\nscaling of your system and method – some simulations (e.g. standard SCF) are\nbetter run on CPUs while others are substantially faster on GPUs (e.g.\nlinear-scaling SCF, post-HF methods). For more details, see the\n[CP2K website](https://www.cp2k.org/gpu).\n\n![CP2K scaling on Mahti and LUMI](../img/cp2k-lumi.png 'CP2K scaling on Mahti and LUMI')\n\n### High-throughput computing with CP2K\n\nHigh-throughput computations can be run conveniently with CP2K using the\nbuilt-in `FARMING` program. This is an excellent option for use cases where the\naim is to run a large amount of independent computations, such as when\ngenerating data for AI/ML pipelines. All subjobs are run in parallel within a\nsingle Slurm allocation, thus avoiding excess calls of `srun` or `sbatch` which\ndecreases the load on the batch queue system.\n\nRunning `FARMING` jobs requires an additional input\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
