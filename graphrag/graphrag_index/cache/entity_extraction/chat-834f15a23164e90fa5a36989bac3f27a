You can test the\nGUI via the Puhti web interface, [www.puhti.csc.fi](../computing/webinterface/index.md),\nbut for more extensive use we recommend installing the GUI on your own laptop/workstation.\n\n## License\n\nSee [the License section of AMS](ams.md#license).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Use via your browser\n\nGo to [puhti.csc.fi](https://puhti.csc.fi/) using a web browser and login using your CSC user account.\n\n1. From there [launch a Desktop](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md#launching). \n2. Open a `Terminal` and move to a suitable working directory.\n3. Load the AMS module `module load ams/2023.104`.\n4. Start the input builder `amsinput` and construct your job.\n5. Save the job (`File-> Save As ...`).\n\nShort jobs can be started directly from the GUI (`File-> Run`), but longer jobs should be submitted to the batch queue. \nAll saved jobs, both calculated and uncalculated, can be found in the GUI under `SCM-> Jobs`.\nBefore you submit a job to the batch queue you have to define what resources it needs (time, memory, number of cores etc.)\n\n1. Under `SCM-> Jobs`, select `Queue -> New -> SLURM`\n2. `Queue Name: My_testqueue`. You can save queues with different names corresponding to different resource requests  \n3. `Remote host:`. Leave empty  \n4. `Remote user:`. Leave empty  \n5. `Remote job directory:`. Leave empty  \n6. `Run command: sbatch --partition=test --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=40 --account=<yourproject> --time=00:10:00 \"$job\" `   \nPlease replace `<yourproject>` with a proper project name. You can use the same command line options as in a normal batch job script.\n7. `Use Local Batch: yes`  \n8. `Prolog command: source /appl/profile/zz-csc-env.sh; module load ams/2023.104; export SCM_TMPDIR=$PWD; export FORT_TMPDIR=$SCM_TMPDIR`\n   This initiates the AMS environment.\n\nSelect the job you want to submit (`SCM-> Jobs`), the queue you want to use (`Queue`) and submit the job `Job-> Run`.  \n\n### Install your own GUI\n\nThe AMS license acquired by CSC allows CSC's academic customers to install the\nAMS-GUI on their local computer. In this way the user can conveniently build\nand set up a computing model. Once the model is ready, the actual computing\ntask is sent to and performed by CSC's servers. The results can then be\nretrieved and analyzed on the local computer. Note that the license for the\nlocal installation only covers the AMS-GUI, and it is only valid for academic\nusage (not government or commercial research).\n\n#### 1. Request credentials\n\nRequest the credentials for downloading the AMS-GUI from [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\nPlease include the tag `AMS-GUI` in the subject field. Note that the license\ncovers only academic usage at CSC (not government or commercial research). The\ncredentials will be reset every 6 months.\n\n#### 2. Download\n\nGet the right binary for your machine from [the SCM website](https://www.scm.com/support/downloads/)\nusing:\n\n* **SCM User ID:** `<the User ID you got from servicedesk@csc.fi>`\n* **Password:** `<the password you got from servicedesk@csc.fi>`   \n\nThe download starts without entering a user ID and the password for users of Safari on Mac. \n\n#### 3. Install\n\n*a. Windows:* run the exe with Administrator privileges, accepting all defaults.  \n*b. Mac:* open the dmg and drag the AMS2023.xxx item to the Applications directory.  \n*c. Linux:* untar the tgz and source the `amsbashrc.sh` in the AMS installation directory.\n\nFor more detailed information, see the [AMS installation manual](https://www.scm.com/doc/Installation/index.html).\n\n#### 4. Run\n\n*a. Windows:* double-click the **AMSjobs** shortcut  \n*b. Mac:* run the **AMS2023.xxx** application  \n*c. Linux:* set up your environment, run `$AMSBIN/adfjobs`\n\nWhen you start AMS for the first time you will be prompted for your username,\npassword, and email address. The license should be automatically fetched from\nthe internet.\n\n#### 5. Control batch jobs\n\nIn order to manage remote jobs you need to set up an ssh key pair between your\nworkstation and Puhti (Mahti), see\n[Setting up SSH keys](../computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md).\n\nAll saved jobs, both calculated and uncalculated, can be found in the GUI under `SCM-> Jobs`.\nBefore you submit a job to the batch queue you have to define what resources it needs\n(time, memory, number of cores etc.)\n\n1. Select `Queue -> New -> SLURM`\n2. `Queue Name: My_testqueue`. You can save queues with different names corresponding to different resource requests\n3. `Remote host: puhti.csc.fi`. \n4. `Remote user: <your CSC username> `   \n5. `Remote job directory: /scratch/<yourproject>`   \n6. `Run command: sbatch --partition=test --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=40 --account=<yourproject> --\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
