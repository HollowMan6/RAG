For example, the following\ncondition\n\n```bash\n[[ 123 > 3 ]]\n```\n\nis `FALSE` because string 123 is alphabetically before string 3. The\nnumerical comparison\n\n```BASH\n[[ 123 -gt 3 ]]\n```\n\nis, however, `TRUE`.\n\nThere are a number of operators you can use to test different attributes\nof a file. The most commonly used operator is `-e` that checks if a file\nexists. As an example, let's assume that we have a simple list of file\nnames called `checklist.txt`. We would like to check which of these\nfiles are found in the current directory. We can use a `for` loop to\nstudy all the file names and the `if` command with `-e` condition to\ntest if the file exists:\n\n```bash\nfor file_name in $(cat checklist.txt)\ndo\n   if [[ -e $file_name ]]\n   then\n      echo \"File $file_name was found\"\n   else\n      echo \"File $file_name was not found\"\n   fi\ndone\n```\n\n## Printing the output\n\nIn the previous examples we have already used the `echo` command to\nwrite text and variables to the standard output (i.e. to the screen or\nto a file by standard output redirection). For example, the command\n\n```bash\necho \"Hello world\"\n```\n\nprints out\n\n```bash\nHello world\n```\n\n`echo` can be used for printing output in many cases, but it does not\nprovide good tools for creating well formatted output with defined\ncolumns. In situations where well-structured text output is needed,\n`printf` should be used instead of `echo`. The syntax of `printf`\nis:\n\n```bash\nprintf \"format definition\" arguments_to_print\n```\n\nThe `format definition` defines what types of output is to be printed.\nCommon types include text (`%s`), integers (`%i`), and floating\npoint numbers (`%f`). The format statements can also define how much\nspace is reserved for each argument and how it is located in the column.\nBelow are some simple examples to illustrate the usage of the `printf`\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nprintf \"%i %s %s %f\\n\" 1 Hello World 23.75\n```\n\nprints out\n\n```bash\n1 Hello World 23.750000\n```\n\nHere, the format statement defines that the first argument is considered\nto be an integer, second and third as strings and the fourth argument as\na floating point number. Note that by default, `printf` does not add a\nnewline character to the end of the output. To do that, the format\nstatement should end with definition `\\n`.\n\nIn the next example we define how many characters are reserved for each\nargument. The command\n\n```bash\nprintf \"%4i %10s %10s %6.2f\\n\" 1 Hello World 23.75\n```\n\nprints out\n\n```bash\n1 Hello World 23.75\n```\n\nHere, we reserve four characters for the first integer, then ten\ncharacters for each of the strings. The floating point number is\npresented with six characters, two of which are after the decimal point.\n\nYou can also add text and control characters like tabulator (`\\t`) to\nthe format statement. The command\n\n```bash\nprintf \"This is my %i:st %s %s\\t %6.1f\\n\" 1 Hello World 23.75\n```\n\nprints out\n\n```bash\nThis is my 1:st Hello World 23.8\n```\n\nIn Linux scripts, `printf` is typically used to print out values stored\nin variables. For example, the commands\n\n```bash\nunit=3g\nvalue=5.3\nprintf \"The resulting value from:%4s\\t is:\\t%6.2f\\n\" $unit $value\n```\n\nprints out\n\n```bash\nThe resulting value from: 3g is: 5.30\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
