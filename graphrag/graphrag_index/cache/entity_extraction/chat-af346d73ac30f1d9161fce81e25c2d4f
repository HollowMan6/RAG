To make the most of the computational\nresources available to you, it is helpful to be aware of the differences.\n\nSee the\n[Python application page](../../apps/python.md)\nfor general information on the Python language and\npre-installed Python environments on CSC supercomputers.\n\n## Creating and managing Python environments\n\n### Installing Python packages to existing modules\n\nIf there is a CSC-provided module that covers _almost_ everything you\nneed, but it is missing a few Python packages, you can try installing\nthose yourself with the pip package manager.\n\nSee the\n[package lists on our Python application page](../../apps/python.md#pre-installed-python-environments)\nto find out which packages are installed in existing modules.\nIf you think that some important package should be included by default\nin a module provided by CSC, do not hesitate to contact our\n[Service Desk](../contact.md).\n\n=== \"Using `venv`\"\n    The recommended way to add packages on top of an existing environment\n    is to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), which\n    is a standard Python module for creating a lightweight \"virtual\n    environment\". You can have multiple virtual environments, for example\n    one for each project.\n\n    For example to install a package called `whatshap` on top of the\n    CSC-provided [python-data](../../apps/python-data.md) module:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd /projappl/<your_project>  # change this to the appropriate path for your project\n    module load python-data\n    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages <venv_name>\n    source <venv_name>/bin/activate\n    pip install whatshap\n    ```\n\n    Unlike for example Tykky, `venv` creates a new directory for the\n    environment, so there is no need for you to create one beforehand.\n    Do not forget to use the `--system-site-packages` flag when creating\n    the virtual environment, otherwise the environment will not find the\n    pre-installed packages from the base module (for example `numpy` from\n    `python-data`).\n\n    Later when you wish to use the virtual environment you only need to\n    load the module and activate the environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    module load python-data\n    source /projappl/<your_project>/<venv_name>/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n    Likewise, when using the virtual environment, make sure\n    to actually have the base module loaded.\n    Naturally, this also applies to Slurm job scripts.\n\n    !!! info \"Compatibility with virtual environments\"\n        Some older CSC modules are not compatible with Python\n        virtual environments. We are still working to update these\n        modules, so if you happen to be working with one of them,\n        you need to use the `pip install --user` approach described on\n        the other tab.\n\n    ---\n\n=== \"Using `pip install --user`\"\n    Another approach to installing additional packages is to do a \"user\n    installation\" with the command `pip install --user`. This approach is\n    easy to use in principle, as it doesn't require setting up a\n    virtual environment. However, package-provided commands may not\n    work out-of-the-box (see the Info box at the end of this section).\n\n    Packages are by default installed to your home\n    directory under `.local/lib/pythonx.y/site-packages` (where `x.y` is\n    the version of Python being used). **Please note that if you install a lot of\n    packages, your home directory can easily run out of space.**\n    This can be avoided by changing the installation folder to make\n    a project-wide installation instead of a personal one. This is\n    done by setting the `PYTHONUSERBASE` environment variable to\n    refer to the new installation directory.\n\n    For example, to add the package `whatshap` on top of the `python-data` module:\n\n    ```bash\n    module load python-data\n    export PYTHONUSERBASE=/projappl/<your_project>/my-python-env\n    pip install --user whatshap\n    ```\n\n    In the above example, the package is now installed inside the\n    `my-python-env` directory in the project's `projappl` directory. Run  \n    `unset PYTHONUSERBASE` if you wish to install packages into your home\n    directory again.\n\n    When using the libraries later, you need to define `PYTHONUSERBASE`\n    again. Naturally, this also applies to Slurm job scripts. For example:\n\n    ```bash\n    module load python-data\n    export PYTHONUSERBASE=/projappl/<your_project>/my-python-env\n    ```\n\n    !!! info \"Packages containing executable files\"\n        Most of our Python modules are implemented as containers.\n        If a package you install also contains executable files,\n        they may not work out of the box, since the executable\n        may look for the Python interpreter using a path that is\n        internal to the container.\n        You might see an error message like this:\n\n        ```bash\n        whatshap: /CSC_CONTAINER/miniconda/envs/env1/bin/python3.9: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n        ```\n\n        You can fix this by editing the first line of the executable\n        (which in our example is located using `which whatshap`) to point\n        to the real Python interpreter (can be found with `which python3`).\n        In our example we would edit the file `~/.local/bin/\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
