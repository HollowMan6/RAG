Here we introduce how it can be\nused to prepare and analyze [Gaussian](../../apps/gaussian.md) jobs on Puhti.\nThe prerequisites are that you have a valid CSC account that belongs to the\nGaussian group, and that you are a member of a CSC project that has access to\nPuhti. This tutorial also assumes that you have Gabedit installed on your local\ncomputer.\n\n## The workflow\n\nIn short, the major steps to construct, run and analyze a Gaussian job on Puhti\nusing Gabedit are:\n\n1. Create the Gaussian input using Gabedit on your local computer.\n2. Copy the input files from your local computer to a suitable working\n   directory on Puhti.\n3. Start the calculation on Puhti.\n4. Copy the results from Puhti to your local computer.\n5. Use Gabedit to analyze the results.\n\n### 1. Create the Gaussian input\n\n1. In Gabedit, build or load your molecular structure.\n2. Define the method and other details you want to use.\n   ![Gabedit input](../../img/gabedit_1.png)\n3. Save it as a Gaussian input in a separate directory (here called `benzene`).\n   ![Gabedit save](../../img/gabedit_2.png)\n\n### 2. Copy the input files to Puhti\n\n1. Copy the whole input directory (here called `benzene`) to a suitable scratch\n   directory on Puhti. Here we use `rsync`. For other methods, see\n   [Moving data between CSC and local workstation](../../data/moving/index.md).\n\n      ```bash\n      rsync -rP benzene username@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_2001234/gabedit\n      ```\n\n### 3. Start the calculation on Puhti\n\n1. Login to Puhti and go that directory:\n\n      ```bash\n      cd /scratch/project_2001234/gabedit/benzene\n      ```\n\n2. Load the gaussian module with `module load gaussian`.\n3. Submit the calculation:\n\n      ```bash\n      subg16 00:10:00 benzene_opt_freq project_2001234\n      ```\n\n### 4. Copy the results back to your own computer\n\n1. Once the gaussian job has finished, copy the whole directory from Puhti back\n  to your own computer. Give this command on your own computer:\n\n      ```bash\n      rsync -rP username@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_2001234/gabedit/benzene/ .\n      ```\n\n### 5. Use Gabedit to analyze the results\n\n1. In Gabedit use `File -> Open` to navigate to the directory where the results\n   are.\n2. In the lower right corner of the `Open file` window change the `*.inp` to\n   `*.com`.\n3. Select the com-file corresponding to your Gaussian job and open it. This\n   opens the main Gabedit window.\n4. Select the tab showing the log file.\n   ![Gabedit analyze](../../img/gabedit_3.png)\n5. The panel on the right shows various options that can be analyzed.\n6. In the example above we calculated the vibrational frequencies. These\n   results can be studied by selecting `Dens. Orb` that opens the\n   `Gabedit: Orbitals/Density/Vibration` window.\n      1. On the canvas do right-click.\n      2. Select `Animation -> Vibration`.\n      3. By selecting a particular mode from the table, it can be animated by\n         hitting `Play`.\n      4. The calculated spectrum is shown by selecting from the `Vibration`\n         window `Tools -> Draw IR spectrum`.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
