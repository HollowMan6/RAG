The name is derived from **t**ape **ar**chive, as it\nwas originally developed to write data to sequential I/O devices with no\nfile system of their own. However, nowadays tar – and its GNU\nversion, **gtar** – are mostly used for data archiving within a normal\ndisk environment. The archive files created by tar contain various file\nsystem parameters, such as name, timestamps, ownership, file access\npermissions, and directory structures, which makes moving and storing\nlarge file sets easier that trying to manage separate files.\n\nBy default, tar does not compress the data. This means that the size of\nthe tar archive file is the same as the sum of the sizes of the packed\nfiles, plus some overhead metadata. If data compression is needed, you\ncan use compression tools like **gzip** or **bzip2** with tar.\n\ntar and gtar are compatible with each other; if you archive your\ndata with tar you can unarchive it with gtar and vice versa.\nNormally tar and/or gtar can be found from any Unix, Linux or macOS\nsystem. In Windows systems you can use for example **7zip** program to\nmanage tar archive files.\n\nThe syntax of a `tar` command is:\n\n```bash\ntar options tar_archive file ...\n```\n\nFor example, we may have a directory called `project_3`, which contains\nnine files called `sample1.txt`, `sample2.txt`, ..., `sample9.txt`. To\nlist the contents of the directory, we could use the command `ls -lh`:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -lh project_3\ntotal 53M\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  16M Nov  9 10:41 sample1.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  16M Nov  9 10:41 sample2.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.3M Nov  9 10:41 sample3.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.9M Nov  9 10:41 sample4.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.9M Nov  9 10:41 sample5.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 3.7M Nov  9 10:42 sample6.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 4.0M Nov  9 10:42 sample7.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 3.9M Nov  9 10:42 sample8.txt\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 3.9M Nov  9 10:42 sample9.txt\n```\n\nWe can archive all the files in the `project_3` directory to a tar\narchive called `project_3.tar` with tar's create (`c`) command:\n\n```bash\ntar cvf project_3.tar project_3\n```\n\nThe command above creates a new tar archive file, `project_3.tar`, which\ncontains the directory `project_3` and all the files in it. Note that the\ncommand does not modify or remove the original files in the source\ndirectory:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -lh\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 2 testuser csc   11 Nov  9 10:44 project_3\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  52M Nov  9 10:46 project_3.tar\n```\n\nThe `tar` command does not require that you assign a certain extension,\nlike `.tar`, for your archive files. However, applying commonly used\nfile name extensions will help you and other users to select right\ncommands for processing the file later on. The newly created tar archive\nfile can now be easily moved to another directory or system and then\nunarchived with the extract (`x\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
