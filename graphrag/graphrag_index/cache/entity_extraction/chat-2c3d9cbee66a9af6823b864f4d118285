Given a query sequence (nucleotide or protein), BLAST compares it to a sequence database and picks out sequences with significant similarity to the probe sequence. BLAST uses a heuristic search protocol, which makes search very fast compared to non-heuristic methods. The heuristics used may however cause BLAST to fail to find all significant hits.\n\nThe command line version of NCBI-BLAST allows a user to modify all parameters of BLAST, to use special methods like PSI-BLAST and PHI-BLAST, and to analyze large data sets.\n\nIn Puhti you can use `pb` (Parallel Blast) command for large sets of query sequences. The `pb` program splits a large search jobs into several subjobs that are executed simultaneously (more below).\n\nThe most commonly used BLAST commands are:\n\n* `blastn` search hits for a nucleotide sequence from nucleotide database\n* `blastp` search hits for a protein sequence from protein database\n* `blastx` search hits for a nucleotide sequence from protein database\n* `psiblast` do iterative search for a protein sequence from protein database\n* `rpsblast` search hits for a protein sequence from protein profile database\n* `rpstblastn` search hits for a nucleotide sequence from protein profile database\n* `tblastn` search hits for a protein sequence from nucleotide database\n* `tblastx` search hits for a nucleotide sequence from nucleotide database by using the protein translations of both query and database sequences.\n\nOther blast commands\n\n* `blastdbcmd` retrieve a sequence or a set of sequences form BLAST databases\n* `makeblastdb` create a new BLAST database\n* `blast_formatter` reformat a BLAST archive formatted BLAST result file.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nFree to use and open source under [GNU LGPLv2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2.15.0\n* Chipster graphical user interface\n\n\n## Usage\n\nAt CSC, BLAST searches can be executed in several ways:\n\n* using the Chipster platform\n* with normal BLAST commands in interactive batch jobs (`sinteractive -i`)\n* as batch jobs with `pb` command in Puhti\n\n## Interactive usage in Puhti\n\nTo use the latest BLAST version in Puhti first give command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nThen launch an interactive batch job session with command:\n\n```bash\nsinteractive -i\n```\n\nReserve 8 GiB of memory for your interactive session.\n\nAfter that you can start using the BLAST commands listed above. For example following command would search for sequence homologs from UniProt database for a protein sequence.\n\n```bash\nblastp -query proteinseq.fasta -db uniprot -out result.txt\n```\n\nYou can use `-help` option to see what command line options are available for a certain BLAST command. For example \n\n```bash\nblastp -help\n```\n\nFor example, command:  \n\n```bash\nblastp -query proteinseq.fasta -evalue 0.001 -db uniprot -outfmt 7 -out result.table\n```\n\nWould run the same search as described above, except that the e-value threshold would be set to 0.001 (`-evalue 0.001`) and the output is printed out to a table (`-outfmt 7`).\n\n## Usage of pb (Parallel BLAST) at CSC\n\nIf your query sequence set contains less than 20 sequences then interactive batch job is probably the most effective way top do the search. However, if your query set contains hundreds or thousands of sequences, then utilizing the parallel computing capacity of Puhti is more effective. For this kind of massive blast searches you can utilize the `pb` command.\n\n`pb` (Parallel BLAST) is designed for situations where the query file includes large amount of sequences. It splits the query task into several subjobs that can be run simultaneously using the resources of the server very effectively. For large sets of query sequences, `pb` can speed up the search up to 50-fold. Two sample `pb` commands for Puhti:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\npb blastn -db nt -query 100_ests.fasta -out results.out\npb psiblast -db swiss -query protseqs.fasta -num_iterations 3 -out results.out\n```\n\n`pb blast` commands can be executed interactively in the login nodes of Puhti. You don't need to create any batch job file yourself. Instead, `pb` command creates and submits a batch job automatically. Once BLAST job is started, `pb` starts a process that monitors the progress of the blast job. As running a large BLAST job may take a long time, you may need to close the monitoring. You can do that by pressing `Ctrl-c`. After that you can start other tasks or log out from Puhti. The BLAST jobs will still continue running in the batch job system. \n\nTo reconnect to your `pb blast` job, go to your scratch directory and run command:\n\n```bash\nblast_clusterrun\n```\n\nThis lists the temporary directories of your unfinished `pb blast` jobs. You can check the job number of your blast job from the directory name. Use this number with `-jobid` option to define the `pb blast` job you wish to reconnect to.\n\n```bash\nblast_clusterrun -jobid some-number\n```\n\n## Using own BLAST databases with pb\n\nThe `pb` program also allows users to do BL\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
