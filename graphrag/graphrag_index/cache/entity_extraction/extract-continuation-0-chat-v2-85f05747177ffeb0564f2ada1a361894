Currently, the\nfollowing universities have access to CSD: Aalto, Helsinki, Oulu,\nEastern-Finland, Jyväskylä, Turku, Åbo Akademi, Lappeenranta University\nof Technology, Finnish Defence Forces University. If you want your\nuniversity or research institute added, fill in the \n[License agreement](../img/CSDLicenseAgreementTemplateNAC.pdf) \nand [contact us via Service Desk](../support/contact.md)\n\nUsing the CSD components requires adhering\n[to these conditions](../img/CSDLicenseAgreementTemplateNAC.pdf).\n\n## Available\n\n- Puhti: 2022.2, 2023.2\n- Download and install locally\n\nRun `module spider ccdc` to see module versions and how to load them.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe **Cambridge Structural Database System** has two major components:\n\n- The Cambridge Structural *Database* ([CSD])\n- *Software* for search, retrieval, display and analysis of CSD\n  contents: ConQuest, VISTA, PreQuest, Superstar, Mercury, GOLD, and\n  CSD-CrossMiner.\n\nSoftware to access and analyse CSD entries:\n\n- [ConQuest] search and retrieval software\n- [Mercury] graphical display, analysis and visualisation of data\n- [Hermes] Main graphical interface to analysis tools\n- [CSD-Editor] In-house database creation tools (previously PreQuest)\n- [IsoStar] A Knowledge Base of Intermolecular Interactions\n- [Mogul] A Knowledge Base of Molecular Geometry\n- [SuperStar] Predicting Protein-Ligand interactions using experimental knowledge-base data\n- [WebCSD] browser access to the CSD database\n- [CrossMiner] interactive versatile pharmacophore query tool\n- [DASH] Solving crystal structures from powder diffraction data interactively (only for Windows)\n\nThere are three ways to access the CSD System:\n\n- Local installation (Windows or Linux, takes up a lot of disk space)\n- Using the CSD System via the [Puhti web interface](../computing/webinterface/index.md)\n- WebCSD (limited functionality), point your browser to\n  [CCDC webserver](http://webcsd.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/)\n\n### Using CSD as a local installation\n\nThe installation media can be downloaded from the CCDC website, but\nneeds the site number and confirmation code of your university. After\ninstallation, you need to activate the product. To obtain the required\ncodes, contact either [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md)\nor the local CSD administrator at your university. This is the\nrecommended way for power users. The full installation requires ~18 GB of disk space.\n\n### Using CSD on Puhti\n\n[Open the Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi/) using a web browser and login\nusing your CSC user account.\n\n1. From there, [launch a Desktop](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md#launching).\n2. Open a terminal and move to a suitable working directory.\n3. Load the CSD module with `module load ccdc`.\n\nNow you have access to CSD programs, e.g. ConQuest, Hermes, Mercury and Mogul. Run them\nby typing `cq`, `hermes`, `mercury`, or `mogul` in the terminal, respectively. Note that\nthe GUI performance can be somewhat slow compared to a local installation.\n\n[GOLD](gold.md) has its own entry in Docs CSC.\n\n### Using WebCSD directly with a browser\n\nThe [WebCSD service](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures) \nprovides most of the search capabilities directly via a browser from\ncomputers within the licensed university's IP range. Access does not need\nfurther authentication. If there are problems, [contact CSC\nService Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\n## References\n\nNew software for searching the Cambridge Structural Database and\nvisualising crystal structures  \nI.
