So, only that local trusted service needs to\nknow the keys instead of the local end users.\n\nThere is unfortunately a bit too much flexibility in the ways different\napplications behave when encrypting files â€” not in the actual encryption per\nse, but for instance in how they store the metadata about selected encryption\nchoices into the encrypted file or how to derive the key from a passphrase.\n\nThe easiest way to deal with this lack of interoperability is to decide and\ndocument what encryption software to use and how to use it in your project\nbefore you start storing encrypted data in CSC's data services for research.\n\n### Notes on specific software\n\n#### GnuPG2\n\nGnuPG version 2 is likely the most widely used good free-of-charge and open\nsource suite of software for encrypted messaging. GnuPG 2.2 is compliant with\nthe OpenPGP RFC4880 and can utilize asymmetric encryption with public keys for\neasier key exchange and transport. Selecting option `--rfc4880` for maximum\nportability would select symmetric encryption algorithm to be 3DES which is not\nconsidered good enough anymore.\n\nOn the command-line the algorithm defaults can be seen with option `--verbose`.\nStarting with version 2.1, the default for symmetric encryption is AES128, for\nolder versions it is CAST5. On the command-line AES256 encryption is selected\nwith options `--symmetric --cipher-algo AES256` which should be the symmetric\nalgorithm to be used.\n\n**Example symmetric encryption run where file data.dat is encrypted:**\n\n```bash\ngpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 data.dat\n```\n\nThis example command creates the encrypted file `data.dat.gpg`.\n\n#### OpenSSL\n\nOpenSSL is more a toolkit for encryption related needs than a standalone\napplication. It is anyway an easy-to-use tool for symmetric encryption.\n\nAES256 encryption is selected with options `enc -aes-256-cbc`. If you use a\npassword to generate the actual encryption key, then use only version 1.1.1 or\nlater and with options `-pbkdf2 -iter 100000`. These same options must also be\nused when decrypting the data.\n\n**Example run with OpenSSL 1.1.1 where file data.dat is encrypted to data.enc:**\n\n```bash\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -in data.dat -out data.enc\nenter aes-256-cbc encryption password:\nVerifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:\n```\n\nIf you choose to generate the actual random binary key and initialization\nvector yourself, then you can also use older versions than 1.1.1 of OpenSSL.\n\n#### Crypt4GH \n\nCrypt4gt is an asymmetric encryption tool that is designed for encrypting large\ndatasets. This tool is recommended by Global Alliance for Genomics and Health,\nand it is used as the encryption tool of CSC sensitive data services. A more\ndetailed description of this encryption tool can be found from the\n[SD Connect instructions](../sensitive-data/sd_connect.md).\n\n#### Cyberduck (Cryptomator)\n\nCyberduck includes an open source tool called Cryptomator for client-side\nencryption. Cyberduck's strong point is its multiplatform GUI interface,\ndrawback is so far short history as cryptography tool, compared to GnuPG or\nOpenSSL.\n\nTo make managing encryption easy for the end user, the Cryptomator treats a\nremote directory as if it were a single encrypted structure (a vault), but it\nactually encrypts each file for its own. In addition to the content of files,\nfile and directory names are encrypted.\n\n[^1]: CSC Services for Research.
