It enables the collection of a timeline of CUDA-related\nactivities on both CPU and GPU, including kernel execution, memory transfers,\nmemory set and CUDA API calls and events or metrics for CUDA kernels.\nProfiling results are displayed in the console after the profiling data is\ncollected, and may also be saved for later viewing by either *nvprof* or the\n*Visual Profiler*.\n\nTo use nvprof, one needs to first load the CUDA module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load cuda\n```\n\nTo profile a CUDA code, one then adds the command `nvprof` before the normal\ncommand to execute the code. Running is otherwise similar to that of any other\nCUDA job on [Puhti](running/example-job-scripts-puhti.md#single-gpu) or [Mahti](running/example-job-scripts-mahti.md#1-2-gpu-job-ie-gpusmall-partition).\n\nAn example of usage and output of nvprof:\n```\n$ nvprof dct8x8\n======== Profiling result:\nTime(%) Time Calls Avg Min Max Name\n 49.52 9.36ms 101 92.68us 92.31us 94.31us CUDAkernel2DCT(float*, float*, int)\n 37.47 7.08ms 10 708.31us 707.99us 708.50us CUDAkernel1DCT(float*,int, int,int)\n 3.75 708.42us 1 708.42us 708.42us 708.42us CUDAkernel1IDCT(float*,int,int,int)\n 1.84 347.99us 2 173.99us 173.59us 174.40us CUDAkernelQuantizationFloat()\n 1.75 331.37us 2 165.69us 165.67us 165.70us [CUDA memcpy DtoH]\n 1.41 266.70us 2 133.35us 89.70us 177.00us [CUDA memcpy HtoD]\n 1.00 189.64us 1 189.64us 189.64us 189.64us CUDAkernelShortDCT(short*, int)\n 0.94 176.87us 1 176.87us 176.87us 176.87us [CUDA memcpy HtoA]\n 0.92 174.16us 1 174.16us 174.16us 174.16us CUDAkernelShortIDCT(short*, int)\n 0.76 143.31us 1 143.31us 143.31us 143.31us CUDAkernelQuantizationShort(short*)\n 0.52 97.75us 1 97.75us 97.75us 97.75us CUDAkernel2IDCT(float*, float*)\n 0.12 22.59us 1 22.59us 22.59us 22.59us [CUDA memcpy DtoA]\n```\nnvprof supports several very useful running options:\n\n* --export-profile: Export the profile to a file\n\n* --analysis-metrics: Collect profiling data that can be imported to Visual\n  Profiler\n\n* --print-gpu-trace: Show trace of function calls\n\n* --openacc-profiling on: Profile OpenACC as well (on by default)\n\n* --cpu-profiling on: Enable some CPU profiling\n\n* --csv --log-file FILE: Generate CSV output and save to FILE; handy for plots\n  or benchmarked analysis\n\n* --metrics M1: Measure only metric M1 which is one of the NVIDIA-provided\n  metrics which can be listed via --query-metrics.\n\nFor more details please check the\n[nvidia documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/profiler-users-guide/).\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n     `nvprof` does not support architectures `>SM70`.
