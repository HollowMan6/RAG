GDAL is used in the background by many GIS-softwares for data reading and writing. GDAL is usually very fast, but in most cases it does not support parallel computing. GDAL also has Java and Python API. Additionally the library includes [command-line tools](https://gdal.org/programs/index.html) for many different purposes. Below we take a look at a few of them.\n\n## Getting started\n\n* [Install GDAL](https://gdal.org/download.html#binaries). If you have installed already QGIS or R/Python GIS packages, then you should have GDAL already. Just find where it is, look for example for OSGeo shell, Anaconda Prompt or gdalinfo file from your disk.\n* Open terminal, OSGeo shell, Anaconda Prompt or Windows Command Prompt.\n* (See the basic command-line help at the end of this page.)\n* [GDAL is available in Puhti](../../../apps/gdal.md).\n\n## Main tools\n\n*  [gdalinfo](http://www.gdal.org/gdalinfo.html) and [ogrinfo](http://www.gdal.org/ogrinfo.html) - for printing metadata about a file (coordinate system, tiling, bands, attribute fields etc). Tools with gdal* in name are for raster files and with ogr* for vector files.\n*   [gdal_translate](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_translate.html) and [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) - for changing format and modifying files.\n*   [gdalwarp](http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html) and [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) - for chaning coordinate system\n*   [gdal_merge ](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_merge.html)and [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) - for joinig files\n*   [gdal_edit](https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_edit.html#gdal-edit) - chaning raster files in place\n*   [gdalbuildvrt](https://gdal.org/programs/gdalbuildvrt.html) - creating virtual rasters, see our [Virtual rasters tutorial](virtual-rasters.md) for details.\n*   GDAL has additionally many other tools, for full reference see [GDAL programs page](https://gdal.org/programs/index.html) where all tools and options of the tools are described in detail.\n\n\nIt is important to notice that most tools create a new file and then some settings might changes, because GDAL-defaults are used, for example raster inner tiling or compression. If you want to preserve these check with gdalinfo what has been used and add additional options to the commands.\n\n## EPSG codes\n\nThe easiest way for defining a coordinate system with GDAL is to use EPSG codes. The most common codes for Finland are:\n\n```\n3067 ETRS-TM35FIN  \n4326 WGS-84\n```\n\n*   More Finnish EPSG codes can be found from [JHS-recommendatation](https://www.suomidigi.fi/sites/default/files/2020-07/JHS197_liite10.doc).\n*   [Database of all EPSG codes](https://epsg.org/home.html).\n\n## Examples\n\n**Print file metadata**\n\n```\ngdalinfo file.tif  \nogrinfo -al -so file.shp\n```\n\n**Change coordinate system**\n\nUse `-t_srs` for defining the new coordinate system.\n\n```\nogr2ogr -t_srs EPSG:3067 output.shp input.shp  \ngdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 input.tif output.tif\n```\n\nIf the original coordinate system is not written to file or GDAL does not understand it correctly, it can be given with `-s_srs`:\n\n`gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:3386 -t_srs EPSG:2393 input_kkj0.tif output_kkj3.tif`\n\n**Add coordinate system**\n\nFor manually adding coordinate system to a file use **-a_srs** (this does not change the data, just adds information about coordinate system).\n\n`ogr2ogr -a_srs EPSG:2394 output_no_srs.shp input_kkj4.shp`  \n`gdal_edit -a_srs EPSG:3067 input.tif`  \n`gdal_translate -a_srs EPSG:2394 input_no_srs.tif output_kkj4.tif`\n\n**Change format**\n\n```\ngdal_translate input.ecw output.tif  \nogr2ogr output.shp input.mif\n```\n\nSet compression and tiling to raster file.  \n`gdal_translate -co COMPRESS=JPEG -co \"TILED=YES input.ecw output.tif`\n\nCreate Cloud Optimized GeoTiff, includes tiling and internal overviews by default\n`gdal_translate world.tif world__cog.tif -of COG -co COMPRESS=LZW`\n\nUse specific encoding for vector data attribute data.\n\n`ogr2ogr output.shp input.gml -lco ENCODING=UTF-8`\n\nRead data from a WFS web service.\n\n`ogr2ogr output.shp WFS:\"http://geohub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/effis/ows\" layername`\n\nRead OpenStreetMap data downloaded for example from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/finland.html).\n\n`ogr2ogr OSM_aineisto finland-latest\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
