Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

It identifies areas, or landscapes, important for retaining high habitat quality and connectivity for multiple biodiversity features (eg. species), providing a quantitative method for enhancing species' long term persistence.\n\n\n## Available\n\n__Zonation__ is available in Puhti with following versions:\n\n* 5.2.0.2 (including Graphical User Interface)\n* 5.1.0 (including Graphical User Interface)\n\n\n## Usage\n\nZonation is available in the __zonation__ module:\n\n```\nmodule load zonation\nz5 <command arguments>\n```\nZonation can be used in Puhti with command-line or graphical interface, as interactive job or with batch system. In any case reserve suitable amount of computing resources: cores and memory. Zonation 5 runs faster, if it can use several cores. In Puhti, it can use one node, which is max 40 cores.  \n\nBefore starting Zonation, move your data to your project's __scratch__ folder. For testing, [zonation5-tutorial data](https://github.com/zonationteam/Zonation5/releases/download/v1.0/manual_and_example_setups.zip) can be used.\n\n### Zonation with Graphical User Interface\n\nZonation Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be started in Puhti web interface:\n\n1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi).\n2. Open [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md)\n3. After launching the Desktop, double-click Zonation icon.\n\n### Working with Zonation interactively\nFor relatively short analysis jobs, it is possible to use Zonation in [interactive session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md).\n\n```\nsinteractive -i\ncd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>\nz5 -w --mode=ABF minimal_settings.z5 /scratch/project_200xxxx/example1_out\n```\n\n### Using Zonation with batch job\nFor longer analysis jobs, Puhti batch system should be used.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=project_200xxxx\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40\n#SBATCH --partition=small\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n#SBATCH --mem=4G\n\nmodule load zonation\ncd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>\nsrun z5 -w --mode=ABF minimal_settings.z5 /scratch/project_200xxxx/example1_out\n```\n\n\n## License \n\nZonation 5 is distributed as is, freely under [GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 (#GNUGPL) (#GNUGPLv3) license.](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)\n\n\n## Citation\n\n`Moilanen, A., Lehtinen, P., Kohonen, I., Virtanen, E., Jalkanen, J. and Kujala, H. 2022.
