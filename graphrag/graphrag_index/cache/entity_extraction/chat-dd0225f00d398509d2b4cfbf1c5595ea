In practice, the DAC can approve or reject applications and revoke access rights in case of misuse. All the communication between the DAC and the data applicant is managed using SD Apply. Each DAC is linked to a specific dataset present in the SD Apply catalogue. DAC members can process data access applications separately, thus only one DAC member needs to approve or reject the application. The SD Apply user interface guides you during the data access revision process.\n\n## DAC process overview\n\n[![SD Apply DAC process overview](images/apply/apply_dac_overview.png)](images/apply/apply_dac_overview.png)\n\n## Step 1: Confirm availability\n\nThe Data Access Committee is established during the data submission process. When a dataset you are associated with is uploaded to CSC, you will receive an automated email via SD Apply asking you to confirm your availability to act as a Data Access Committee member. Follow the link in your email or log in directly to [SD Apply](https://sd-apply.csc.fi) and confirm your availability. \n\n## Step 2: Login\n\nAs a DAC member, you receive email notifications each time when an applicant applies for data access to the dataset you are associated with.\n\nTo start processing applications, follow the link in your email or log in directly to [SD Apply](https://sd-apply.csc.fi/). Login to SD Apply is possible either with user identity federation systems (Haka, Virtu and ELIXIR login) or with CSC account. Use the identity provider your organisation/institution recommends.\n\n[![SD Apply login page](images/apply/apply_login.png)](images/apply/apply_login.png)\n\n!!! note\n    Always use the same identity provider when you log in to SD Apply because all your actions are connected to your login identity.\n\n## Step 3: Process the application\n\nIn SD Apply, navigate to the \"Actions\" tab to see all the applications that are waiting for approval. Select *View* to open the application you want to process. You do not have to follow any specific order when you process the applications. The approval process is fully dynamic.\n\n[![SD Apply \"Actions\" tab and application](images/apply/apply_dac.png)](images/apply/apply_dac.png)\n\n### Approve or reject the application\n\nYou can approve or reject the application right away if the applicant has provided all the needed information. Select *Approve or reject application* under \"Actions\". If you reject an application, we recommend telling the applicant why the application was rejected by writing a comment.\n\nThe applicant will receive an email notification about the decision. Once you approve or reject the application, the decision is final. You cannot edit it later. If the applicant has added members to their application, the members will get access rights too when the application is approved, if they have accepted the terms of use. Any member not having accepted the terms of use by that time will get access rights after they log in to SD Apply and accept the terms of use.\n\n!!! note\n    If the owner of the dataset has removed the dataset that applicant is applying for access, SD Apply will give a warning, but you can still process the application. However, if the dataset has been removed, you cannot approve or reject the application.\n    \n### Request for a decision or a review\n\nDepending on the practices of your organisation, it might be necessary to request a decision on the application or request someone to review the application. To request for a decision or a review, choose *Request review* or *Request decision* under \"Actions\" and locate the user in the drop-down list or use the search function. You can add one or more users. \n\nThe requested user will receive an email notification about a review or a decision request. You can still approve or reject the application even if the requested user has not reviewed the application. You will receive an email after a decision or a review has been made. See “Email notifications” if you want to know when you will receive notifications.\n\n### Return the application to the applicant\n\nIf the application is missing some information, you can return it to the applicant. Write a comment on the application or attach a file of the changes you want the applicant to make. Select *Return to applicant* under \"Actions\" to return the application.\n\nThe applicant will receive an email notification about a returned application. They can resubmit the application after editing it. Resubmitted applications will show up in the \"Actions\" tab. The changes the applicant has made will show as highlighted on the application form.\n\n### Close the application\n\nYou can close the application at any stage of the process by selecting *Close application*. Closing means that the application process is cancelled and that the application cannot be modified or opened again. Write a comment on the comment field to explain why did you close the application.\n\nWe recommend closing the application, if it is somehow inappropriate. Deleting applications is not possible because we want to always provide a full history of the application process. You can find closed applications in the \"Actions\" tab under \"Processed applications\".\n\n### Edit the application\n\nYou can also edit applications by the following ways:\n\n- **Change the licenses**. The applicant will receive an email notification about the change in terms of use and has to accept the new licenses before they will be granted access rights.\n\n- **Add or remove members**. If you do not want to grant access to all members in the application, you can remove additional members. Adding members is also possible.\n\n- **Change the applicant**. You can change the applicant to another member of the application. This can be useful if, for example, the original applicant has left the applying organisation.\n\n- **Change the resources of the application**. If the applicant is applying for access\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
