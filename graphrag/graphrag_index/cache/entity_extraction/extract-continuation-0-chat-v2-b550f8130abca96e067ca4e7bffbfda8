They protect data against _accidental deletion_, _hardware failure_, _corruption_, _ransomware_ and more. There are several data backup strategies. Depending on the application and the data it contains, the backup strategy might vary. Factors like cost, complication to setup, and reproducibility of the data, affect the strategy to follow. Pouta clouds do not provide a backup solution, but help setting up one by providing advanced storage solutions like [Cinder] and [Allas].\n\nOne common backup strategy is the 3-2-1 rule. 3 copies of the data (including the original production one), 2 different media of storage and 1 offsite backup. Other basic backup principle is that copies cannot be deleted or corrupted from the original source (this is to prevent accidents and ransomware). Using a dedicated backup tool is recommended, these tools allow to easily create immutable copies that are properly dated and scheduled. They also facilitate other secondary aspects like encryption and older backups deletion. It is also very important to validate that the backups are indeed valid and that it is possible to recover the data as intended.\n\n<center>![3-2-1](../../img/3-2-1.drawio.png)\n\n*3-2-1 strategy*</center>\n\n## Use Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\n\nThe application you develop, the IaC code that deploys its infrastructure, and the configuration management code that configures it, should be tracked by a version control system of your choice, the most popular and de facto standard is [GIT]. Once the code of the application is in Version control, the next step is to use Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).\n\n<center>![Git](../../img/git.drawio.png)\n\n*Git development and collaboration*</center>\n\nOnce the code of the application is in Version control, the next step is to use Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).\n\nCI is when each change committed to your **codebase** is automatically **built** and **tested**. This allows to find issues sooner and systematically. The kind of tests that can be added could be generic, like code analysis tools, or purpose written tests that check the functionality of the code, preventing bug regressions and so. Finally it is also common, to have internal procedure checks, like make sure every new branch has a ticket associated with it. Experience with these kind of practices show that time and effort is saved by teams when using CI. There are some well known CI services online such as [Travis CI], [Circle CI] and [Github actions], that have a very low barrier of entry and give right away added value.\n\nCD is when the **release** of specific versions of the software is done automatically. And more importantly, the **deployment** of those validated versions is also automatic. So if a change passes both all the automatic tests and the review of other members of the coding team, the change is deployed automatically. This degree of automation also requires a solid deployment process that does not require downtime and confident in the whole process. New deployed versions will be **monitored**, this information will probably lead to **planning** of new versions. \n\n<center>![CI CD](../../img/ci-cd.drawio.png)</center>\n\n## Use Devops tools\n\n### Infrastructure as Code tools\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) tools are very useful, as they allow to specify complex application infrastructures (VM, networking, storage, ...) using text files (code) known as templates. Then the tool will use the API of the cloud provider to automatically create/configure/delete the corresponding infrastructure. Some IaC tools which are stable and widely used are:\n\n* **Terraform** is a very known IaC tool. It is dedicated to only being an IaC tool. It is cloud agnostic thanks to the use of \"providers\", like the [OpenStack provider]. See the example [terraform-openstack-example].\n* **Heat** is the tool integrated by OpenStack. See the example [heat-openstack-example].\n* **Ansible** has some modules that provide IaC functionality. See the example [ansible-openstack-example].\n\nYou can see above three examples, one for for each tool. All of them aim to get the same result: One or more VMs with nginx installed and few local files deployed. In order to choose which one to use, you will need to consider the up and downs of the tools and use the one that fits more your use case. For example, if you think about support. Both Heat and Ansible are developed by the OpenStack team and the Terraform provider is a community written software. In addition, Heat is provided together with OpenStack and can  be used via command line or the web interface. Finally Heat is the only one that the Pouta team fully supports. On the other hand, Terraform is more widely used and will be easier to find examples and help than the other two tools.\n\n!!! Info \"Terraform license\"\n\n    Terraform has changed its license (Summer 2023), [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is an alternative client created to avoid licensing issues that might be created. At this time Tofu is a drop in replacement, but it is expected to diverge with time. At this time there is no ansible module for Tofu.\n\n\n<center>![Heat webUI](../../img/heat-web-ui.png)\n*Heat web UI*\n</center>\n\n!!! warning \"Tools evolve\"\n\n    Keep in mind that the situations for these (and most) tools evolve over time, support may get better or dropped altogether, features and bugs may be fixed, ...\n\n### Configuration management tools\n\nEvery application you build has some dependencies in the form of software libraries and their\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Pouta Clouds<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta Clouds do not provide a backup solution but help in setting up one by providing advanced storage solutions like Cinder and Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cinder<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage solution provided by Pouta Clouds for setting up backups)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Allas<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another storage solution offered by Pouta Clouds to assist in backup setups)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The most popular and de facto standard version control system used for tracking application development and configuration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Travis CI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A well-known Continuous Integration service that builds and tests code changes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Circle CI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another prominent Continuous Integration service that helps in automatically building and testing code changes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Github Actions<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A CI/CD tool provided by GitHub to automate code building, testing, and deployment processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Terraform<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A widely used Infrastructure as Code tool that is cloud agnostic and uses providers like the OpenStack provider)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Heat<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An Infrastructure as Code tool integrated by OpenStack for specifying complex application infrastructures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ansible<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool with modules that provide Infrastructure as Code functionality, developed by the OpenStack team)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OpenStack Provider<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A provider used by Terraform to manage resources in OpenStack clouds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OpenTofu<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An alternative client to Terraform created to avoid licensing issues, expected to diverge over time)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cinder<|>Pouta Clouds<|>Cinder is a storage solution provided by Pouta Clouds for backup setups<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Allas<|>Pouta Clouds<|>Allas is another storage solution offered by Pouta Clouds for backup purposes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Terraform<|>OpenStack Provider<|>Terraform uses the OpenStack Provider to manage resources in OpenStack clouds<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Heat<|>Pouta Clouds<|>Heat is supported by Pouta Clouds and is integrated with OpenStack for infrastructure management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ansible<|>Pouta Clouds<|>Ansible, developed by the OpenStack team, is supported by Pouta Clouds for infrastructure as code capabilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OpenTofu<|>Terraform<|>OpenTofu is created as an alternative to Terraform to avoid licensing issues<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
