In particular, please **do\nnot read a huge number of files from the shared file system**, use\nfast local disk or package your data into larger files instead!\n\nFor multi-GPU and multi-node jobs we recommend using the PyTorch\nDistributed Data-Parallel framework. You can read more about this and\nfind examples of how to use PyTorch DDP on CSC's supercomputers in the\n[Multi-GPU and multi-node section of our Machine learning\nguide](../support/tutorials/ml-multi.md)\n\n\n### PyTorch profiler\n\nIf your PyTorch program is slow, or you notice that it has a [low GPU\nutilization](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md#gpu-utilization) you can\nuse the [PyTorch\nprofiler](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_profiler_tutorial.html)\nto analyze the time and memory consumption of your program.\n\nThe PyTorch profiler can be taken into use by adding a few lines of\ncode to your existing PyTorch program:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.profiler import profile, ProfilerActivity\n\nprof = profile(\n    schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(\n        skip_first=10,\n        wait=5,\n        warmup=1,\n        active=3, \n        repeat=1)\n    on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler('./logs/profiler'),\n    activities=[ProfilerActivity.CPU, ProfilerActivity.CUDA],\n    record_shapes=True,   # record shapes of operator inputs\n    profile_memory=True,  # track tensor memory allocation/deallocation\n    with_stack=True       # record source code information\n)\n```\n\nIn this example we opt to skip the first 10 batches and record only a\nfew batches for profiling. The profiling trace is saved into\nTensorBoard format into the directory `logs/profiler`. To see all the\noptions, check the [PyTorch API documentation for\nprofiler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/profiler.html#torch.profiler.profile).\n\nNext you need to start and stop the profiler, and record the\nindividual steps (typically the batches). This would typically be\naround your training loop:\n\n```python\nprof.start()\n\nfor batch in train_loader:\n    # normal forward and backprop stuff here\n    prof.step()\n\nprof.stop()\n```\n\nIn our [GitHub\nrepository](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples/) we gave a\nfull example with profiling:\n[`mnist_ddp_profiler.py`](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples/blob/master/mnist_ddp_profiler.py)\nwith a corresponding [Slurm batch job\nscript](https://github.com/CSCfi/pytorch-ddp-examples/blob/master/run-ddp-gpu1-profiler.sh).\n\nAfter running the job you can view the output of the profiler using\nTensorBoard.  Start a TensorBoard session in the [web interface of the\nsupercomputer](../computing/webinterface/apps.md) you are using. If\nthe PyTorch profiler isn't opened automatically you may be able to\nfind it as *PYTORCH_PROFILER* in the tab bar. If the tab isn't visible\nby default, it can be found at the pull-down menu on the right-hand\nside of the interface.\n\nA particularly useful view is the Trace view (select \"Trace\" from the\n\"Views\" pull-down menu). Below is an example screenshot of a run of\nthe example linked to above.\n\n![Screenshot of PyTorch profiler in TensorBoard](../img/pytorch-profiler1.png)\n\nThe Trace view can be zoomed in and panned using the small toolbar to\nthe upper right, or using the 'a' and 'd' keys to pan, and 'w' and 's'\nfor zooming in and out.\n\nIn the screenshot we can see:\n\n- Area 1, marked with red, shows the data loading (can be seen by\n  zooming in and reading the function names shown.
