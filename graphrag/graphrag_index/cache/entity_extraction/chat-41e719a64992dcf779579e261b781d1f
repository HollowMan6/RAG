It is one of \nthe popular workflow managers within the bioinformatics community, but\nis not specific to bioinformatics. Like in [Nextflow](../apps/nextflow.md), Snakemake also supports running scripts (via script/run/shell directive of Snakemake rule) from other languages such as R, bash and Python.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Available \n\nVersions available at CSC:\n\n* Puhti: 7.15.2, 7.17.1, 8.4.6\n\n## License\n\nSnakemake is released under the\n[MIT License](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/license.html).\n\n## Usage\n\nSnakemake is activated by loading `snakemake` module as below:\n\n```bash\nmodule load snakemake\n```\n\nExample of loading `snakemake` module with a specific version:\n\n```bash\nmodule load snakemake/8.4.6\n```\n\nFor usage help, use command:\n\n```bash\nsnakemake --help\n```\n\nPlease refer to our tutorial on [running Snakemake workflow on Puhti](../support/tutorials/snakemake-puhti.md) for more details.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe latest version of snakemake (v8.4.6) was installed on Puhti using virtual environment *via* pip3.
