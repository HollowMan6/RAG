The general idea is to use a `CronJob` that will create a dump file of the database and upload it to Allas.\n\n!!! Warning\n    This is a simple example, the backup SQL file is not compressed, the checksums are not verified, there is no encryption, ... it just shows the basic idea of creating a backup and putting it in object storage.\n\n    You can find the address of the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/CSCfi/rclone-template/tree/psql). Feel free to clone and edit it to suit your needs.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* A postgres or  maria DB. You need to have read access to it. To deploy a new DB in Rahti, you can use the Postgres or MariaDB template provided in the catalog. It is also possible to backup an external DB, but all instructions assume the DB is running in Rahti in the same namespace as the backup process will be run.\n\n\n* A secret that will take the value of `$DBHOST` (either `postgresql` or `mariadb`) with the following keys: `database-user`, `database-password`, and `database-name`. This secret is created by rclone's template, but will need to be created manually if Postgres or Mariadb is running outside Rahti.\n\n* The `ACCESS_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` to access Allas. You may get them by doing:\n\n```bash\npip install python-openstackclient\n```\n\nThen go to [OpenRC download](https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/openrc/), download the OpenStack RC File v2.0, source it, and input your password when prompted:\n\n```bash\n$ source ~/Downloads/project_XXXXXXX-openrc.sh\nPlease enter your OpenStack Password for project project_XXXXXXX as user <USER>:\n\n```\n\nFinally you can create the credentials:\n\n```bash\nopenstack ec2 credentials create\n```\n\nOr if you already have created the credentials, you may show them by doing:\n\n```bash\nopenstack ec2 credentials list -f yaml\n```\n\n* An Allas bucket/container. You may create it from the web interface, or using `rclone`.\n\n## Add the CronJob\n\nFirst you need to clone the repository with the template and add it to the Rahti namespace where Postgres or Mariadb is running:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/cscfi/rclone-template.git -b psql\ncd rclone-template\noc create -f rclone.yaml\n```\n\nOnce the template is added to your namespace, you just need to deploy it:\n\n```sh\n$ oc process rclone \\\n    ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \\\n    SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \\\n    BUCKET_DIR=existing_bucket/existing/path \\\n    DBHOST=postgresql \\ # or mariadb\n    SCHEDULE=\"0 4 * * *\" | oc create -f -\n```\n\nThis will run the backup process every day at 4:00 am. You may change the schedule, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron> for reference.\nThe backups won't be overwritten as it will take the date and time of the backup start.\n\nYou can find more information about the backup and restore commands here:  \n\n- PostgreSQL: [Backup database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-administration/postgresql-backup-database/) and [Restore database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-administration/postgresql-restore-database/)\n\n- MariaDB: [Backup database](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-dump/) and [Restore database](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/backup-and-restore-overview/)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
