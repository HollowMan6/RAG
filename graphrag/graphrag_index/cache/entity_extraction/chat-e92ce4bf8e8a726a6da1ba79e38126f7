Usage on\npuhti.csc.fi is very similar. That said, VASP is a program the usage of\nwhich requires some experience. It is advised that new VASP users start\nout with a supervisor or an experienced colleague.\n\n## Available\n\nSee available VASP versions in with command\n\n```console\nmodule avail vasp\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe usage of VASP requires a license, which must be acquired directly\nfrom the developers of the software.\n\n!!! warning \"\"\n    After acquiring the license, please send email to\n    [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md), including the email address\n    you have registered for the VASP license and your username at CSC.\n\n## Usage\n\nPrecompiled VASP executables and pseudopotentials are available\nthrough the module environment. Use the command\n\n```console\nmodule show vasp\n```\n\nto see more detailed information.\n\n### An example batch job script for a small test\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --ntasks=4\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1GB\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n\nmodule load vasp\nsrun vasp_std\n```\n\nFor more options and details, see how to create batch job scripts for\n[Puhti](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md) and\n[Mahti](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-mahti.md).\n\n### VASP tutorials in JupyterLab\n\n[VASP tutorials](https://www.vasp.at/tutorials/latest/) can also be\nfollowed using JupyterLab from the\n[Mahti web interface](https://www.mahti.csc.fi). Open the *Jupyter* app,\nand from *Settings* -> *Python*, select *Custom module* and type in\n*py4vasp*. When submitting jobs from the JupyterLab terminal window to\ncompute nodes, first load module `vasp`, and then use a command similar to\n\n```console\nsrun -p test -A <project> -t 5 -n 2 vasp_std\n```\n\ninstead of the `mpirun ...` command shown in the tutorial.\n\n### Performance optimization\n\nFirst, the performance of VASP depends crucially on the parameters in\nthe INCAR file that control how the different k-points, bands and FFT\ncoefficients are distributed among the MPI tasks, and that the correct\nversion (std/gam/ncl) of the executable is used.\n\nSecond, the provided prebuilt executables are built as \"vanilla\" as\npossible and provide a reasonable baseline. The performance\noptimization for large experiments should be done on a per case basis.\nThe commands that created the prebuilt executables are in\n`$VASPDIR/README.sh`, and can be used as a starting point\nfor building more optimized and/or otherwise modified executables.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
