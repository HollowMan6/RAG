The BWA job uses 8 cores (`--cpus-per-task=8`) with a total of 32 GB of memory (`--mem=32000`). The maximum duration of the job is twelve hours (`--time 12:00:00`). All the cores are assigned from one computing node (`--nodes=1`). In addition to the resource reservations, you have to define the billing project for your batch job. This is done by replacing `your_project_name` with the name of your project.
