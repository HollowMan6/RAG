The SSH keys are the only way to connect to LUMI when using a Linux, macOS or Windows PowerShell terminal, or MobaXterm or PuTTY from Windows. There is no option for using passwords. \n\nLUMI only accepts SSH keys based on the RSA (4096 bit) or ed25519 algorithms.\nIf possible, we recommend using ed25519.\n\n## Generate your SSH keys\n\nIf you already have an appropriate SSH key pair that you want to use with LUMI,\nyou may skip to [registering your public key][jump-register-keys]. If not,\nstart by generating an SSH key pair as detailed below.\n\n=== \"From a terminal (all OS)\"\n\n    An SSH key pair can be generated using a Linux, macOS, Windows PowerShell\n    terminal. For example, you can use the following command to generate\n    an ed25519 key:\n\n    ```bash\n    ssh-keygen -t ed25519\n    ```\n\n    or, alternative, use the following command to generate a 4096 bit RSA key:\n\n    ```bash\n    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n    ```\n\n    You will be prompted for a file name and location where to save the\n    key. Accept the defaults by pressing ++enter++. Alternatively, you can \n    choose a custom name and location and add it interactively or as a\n    command line argument with for example `-f /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa_lumi`.\n\n    Next, you will be asked for a passphrase. Please choose a secure\n    passphrase. It should be at least 8 (preferably 12) characters long and\n    should contain numbers, letters and special characters. **Do not leave the\n    passphrase empty**.\n\n    After that an SSH key pair is created, i.e. a pair of files containing\n    the public and private keys, e.g. files named `id_rsa_lumi`\n    (the **private** key) and `id_rsa_lumi.pub` (the **public** key) in your\n    `/home/username/.ssh/` directory.\n\n=== \"With MobaXTerm or PuTTY (Windows)\"\n\n    An SSH key pair can be generated with the PuTTygen tool or with MobaXterm \n    (**Tools :octicons-arrow-right-16: MobaKeyGen**). Both tools are identical.\n    \n    In order to generate your key pairs for LUMI, choose the option RSA and\n    set the number of bits to 4096. The, press the *Generate* button.\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"../../assets/images/win-keygen-step1.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Create SSH key pair with windows - step 1\">\n    </figure>\n\n    You will be requested to move the mouse in the Key area to generate some \n    entropy; do so until the green bar is completely filled.\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"../../assets/images/win-keygen-step2.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Create SSH key pair with windows - step 2\">\n    </figure>\n\n    After that, enter a comment in the Key comment field and a strong\n    passphrase. Please choose a secure passphrase. It should be at least 8\n    (preferably 12) characters long and should contain numbers, letters and\n    special characters. **Do not leave the passphrase empty**.\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"../../assets/images/win-keygen-step3.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Create SSH key pair with windows - step 3\">\n    </figure>\n\n    The next step is to save your public and private key. Click on the *Save \n    public key* button and save it to the desired location (for example, with \n    `id_rsa_lumi.pub` as a name). Do the same with your private key by clicking\n    on the *Save private key* button and save it to the desired location (for \n    example, with `id_rsa_lumi` as a name).\n\n    !!! note \"Key format\"\n\n        To use your key, you may need two different key formats. The\n        instructions above generate a private key in PuTTY format (PPK), which\n        can be used with PuTTY and in a MobaXTerm SSH session created via the\n        MobaXTerm GUI.\n                \n        However, if you are using the OpenSSH client (the ssh command in a\n        MobaXTerm terminal), you will need a key in the OpenSSH format. To\n        convert your key, go to the **Conversions :octicons-arrow-right-16:\n        Export OpenSSH key** menu in the key generator tool and save it in the\n        OpenSSH format.\n\n        You can convert between these two key formats at any time\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a supercomputer that requires SSH key pairs for terminal access, supporting RSA (4096 bit) or ed25519 algorithms for secure connections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>EVENT<|>A security measure for accessing LUMI, involving a public and private key, generated using RSA or ed25519 algorithms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An encryption algorithm used for generating SSH key pairs for secure access to LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ED25519<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An encryption algorithm recommended for generating SSH key pairs for secure access to LUMI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUTTYGEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used for generating SSH key pairs on Windows, supporting RSA and ed25519 algorithms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool that includes a key generator for creating SSH key pairs for LUMI, supporting RSA and ed25519 algorithms)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>LUMI<|>SSH key pairs are required for secure terminal access to LUMI<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSA<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>RSA is one of the algorithms used for generating SSH key pairs for LUMI access<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ED25519<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>ED25519 is recommended as an algorithm for generating SSH key pairs for LUMI access<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUTTYGEN<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>PuTTYgen is used to generate SSH key pairs for accessing LUMI on Windows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>SSH KEY PAIR<|>MobaXterm includes a key generator for creating SSH key pairs for LUMI access<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
