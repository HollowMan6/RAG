In addition, Intel changed the underlying technology of their compilers and renamed the old compilers as Intel Compilers Classic.\n\nC/C++ and Fortran applications can be built with Intel or GNU\ncompiler suites. The compiler suite is selected via the [Modules](modules.md)\nsystem, i.e.\n\n```bash\n# New Intel compilers \nmodule load intel-oneapi-compilers\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n# Old Intel compilers\nmodule load intel-oneapi-compilers-classic\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nmodule load gcc\n```\n\nDifferent applications function better with different suites, so the selection\nneeds to be done on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe actual compiler commands for building a serial application with these\nsuites:\n\n| Compiler suite | C  | C++ | Fortran |\n| :------------- | :- | :-- | :------ |\n| [Intel, new](https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe/documentation/get-started) | icx | icpx | ifx |\n| [Intel, classic](https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe/documentation/get-started) | icc | icpc | ifort |\n| [GNU](https://gcc.gnu.org) | gcc | g++ | gfortran |\n\nIntel and GNU compilers use different compiler options. The recommended basic optimization\nflags are listed in the table below. It is recommended to start from the safe level\nand then move up to intermediate or even aggressive, while making sure the results are\ncorrect and the program's performance has improved.\n\n| Optimisation level | Intel                        | GNU               |\n| :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------- |\n| **Safe**           | -O2 -xHost -fp-model precise | -O2 -march=native |\n| **Intermediate**   | -O2 -xHost                   | -O3 -march=native |\n| **Aggressive**     | -O3 -xHost -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -fimf-use-svml=true -qopt-zmm-usage=high| -O3 -march=native -ffast-math -funroll-loops -mprefer-vector-width=512|\n\nA detailed list of options for the Intel and GNU compilers can be found on the _man_\npages (`man icc/ifort`, `man gcc/gfortran` when the corresponding programming\nenvironment is loaded, or in the compiler manuals (see the links above).\n\nPlease note that some flags, for example `-no-prec-div` and `-qopt-zmm-usage`, are currently supported only by the intel classic compilers (`icc`/`icpx`/`ifort`). More information about the current and planned flags support for the intel compilers can be checked with `icx -qnextgen-diag` or in the manuals.\n\nAlso, not all applications benefit from the AVX-512 vector set\n(`-xHost` or `-march=native`). It may be a good idea to also test AVX2\n(`-xCORE-AVX2` or `-mavx2`) and compare the performance.\n\n\nList all available versions of the compiler suites:\n\n```bash\nmodule spider intel-oneapi-compilers\nmodule spider gcc\n```\n\n## Building GPU Applications\n\nGPU support in Puhti is provided through NVIDIA compilers:\n\n- The `nvc` compiler is a C11 compiler that supports OpenACC for NVIDIA GPUs, and OpenACC and OpenMP for multicore CPUs.\n\n- The `nvc++` compiler is a C++17 compiler that supports GPU programming with C++17 parallel algorithms, OpenACC, and OpenMP offloading on NVIDIA GPUs. However, it does not currently support C++ CUDA codes.\n\n- The `nvcc` compiler is the CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler driver for NVIDIA GPUs.\n\n- The `nvfortran` compiler is the CUDA Fortran compiler driver for NVIDIA GPUs, supporting both OpenACC and multicore processing for OpenACC and OpenMP.\n\nSpecific instructions on how to load and use these compilers are provided in the following sections.\n\n### CUDA\n\nThe CUDA compiler (`nvcc`) takes care of compiling the CUDA code for the target\nGPU device and passing on the rest to a non-CUDA compiler (i.e. `gcc`). For example, to load the CUDA 11.7 environment together with the GNU compiler:\n\n```bash\nmodule load gcc/11.3.0 cuda/11.7.0\n```\n\nTo generate code for a given target device, tell the CUDA\ncompiler what compute capability the target device supports. On Puhti, the\nGPUs (Volta V100) support compute capability 7.0. Specify this using\n`-gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70`.\n\nFor example, compiling a CUDA kernel (`example.cu`) on Puhti:\n\n```bash\nnvcc -gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70 example.cu\n```\n\nIn principle, it is also possible to target multiple GPU architectures by repeating\n`-gencode` multiple times for different compute capabilities. However, this is\nnot necessary on Puhti, since there is only one type of GPU.\n\n### OpenACC\n\n!!!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computing environment that provides general instructions for compiling software, including CPU and GPU applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intel provides compiler suites for C/C++ and Fortran applications, with specific instructions for compiling on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GNU offers compiler suites for building applications on Puhti, with specific optimization flags recommended)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NVIDIA provides compilers for GPU applications on Puhti, including support for CUDA and OpenACC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUDA<|>EVENT<|>CUDA is a compiler and technology for programming NVIDIA GPUs, with specific instructions for compiling on Puhti)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEL<|>PUHTI<|>Intel's compiler suites are used for compiling applications on Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GNU<|>PUHTI<|>GNU's compiler suites are used for compiling applications on Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA<|>PUHTI<|>NVIDIA's compilers are used for GPU applications on Puhti<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUDA<|>NVIDIA<|>CUDA is a technology and compiler provided by NVIDIA for GPU programming<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
