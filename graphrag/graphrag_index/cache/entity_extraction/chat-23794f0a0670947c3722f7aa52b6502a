The role of\nLustre is to chunk up files into data blocks and spread file data across\nmultiple storage servers, which can be written to and read from in parallel.\n\n## Lustre Building Blocks\n\nA Lustre file system is composed of three major functional units as shown in\nthe simplified diagram below.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/lustre-overview.svg\"\n    width=\"600px\"\n    alt=\"Overview of the building blocks of a Lustre file system\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>Overview of the building blocks of a Lustre file system</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n- One or more **metadata servers (MDS)** that has one or more **metadata\n  targets (MDT)** per Lustre file system that stores namespace metadata, such\n  as filenames, directories, access permissions, and file layout\n- One or more **object storage servers (OSS)** that store file data on one or\n  more **object storage targets (OST)**\n- **Clients** are compute-, visualization- or login nodes that access and use\n  the data\n\n## File Striping\n\nOne of the main factors leading to the high performance of Lustre file systems\nis the ability to stripe data across multiple storage targets (OSTs). This\nmeans that files are split into chunks which are then distributed among the\nOSTs. Read and write operations on striped files will access multiple OSTs\nconcurrently. As a result, I/O performance is improved since writing or reading\nfrom multiple OSTs simultaneously increases the available I/O bandwidth.\n\n<figure>\n  <img \n    src=\"../../../assets/images/lustre-striping.svg\" \n    width=\"600px\"\n    alt=\"Sriping of a 8MB file over 4 OSTs\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n    striping of an 8 MB file over 4 OSTs (stripe count = 4). Each stripe is 1 MB\n    (stripe size = 1m) in size. Each OST store 2 stripes.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFile striping will predominantly improve performance for applications doing\nserial I/O from a single node or parallel I/O to a single shared file from\nmultiple nodes. This behavior is usually found in application using MPI-I/O,\nparallel HDF5 and parallel NetCDF.\n\n### Set the Striping Pattern\n\nThe striping for a file or directory can be set using the command `lfs\nsetstripe`.\n\n```bash\n$ lfs setstripe --stripe-count <count> --stripe-size <size> <dir|file>\n```\n\nwhere `<count>` sets the number of stripes, i.e. the number of OSTs and\n`<size>` the size of the stripes. The argument of the `lfs setstripe` command\nis a path to a directory or a file:\n\n- if a directory is used, it sets the default layout for new files created in\n  the directory. This default layout can then be changed for individual\n  files inside the directory by creating them with the `lfs setstripe` command.\n- if a file is used, a new file with the specified layout will be created.\n\nMaximal striping can be achieved by setting the stripe count to `-1`.\n\n### Get the Striping Pattern\n\nInformation about the striping of a directory or a file can be retrieved using\nthe `lfs getstripe` command.\n\n```bash\n$ lfs setstripe --stripe-count=4 --stripe-size=2m /scratch/user/test\n$ touch /scratch/user/test/file.txt\n$ lfs getstripe /scratch/user/test/\n/scratch/user/test/\nstripe_count:  4 stripe_size:   2097152 pattern: raid0 stripe_offset: -1\n\n$ lfs getstripe /scratch/e1000/olouant/test/file.txt\n/scratch/user/test/file.txt\nlmm_stripe_count:  4\nlmm_stripe_size:   2097152\nlmm_pattern:       raid0\nlmm_layout_gen:    0\nlmm_stripe_offset: 14\n        obdidx           objid           objid           group\n            14        46050141      0x2beab5d                0\n             1        45873824      0x2bbfaa0                0\n             3        45885822      0x2bc297e                0\n             5        46052767      0x2beb59f                0\n```\n\nIn the example above, we see that `file.txt` inherited the layout of its parent\ndirectory and that the file is striped on 4 OSTs (14, 1, 3 and 5).\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nStriping should be adapted to your application I/O pattern and the size of your\nfiles. The following section describes general considerations.\n\n### Stripe count\n\nIn theory, a larger number of stripes increases the I/O bandwidth and thus\nperformance. In particular, applications which write to a single file from\nhundreds of nodes, may benefit from striping over as many OSTs. Moreover,\nstriping is needed if you write a huge amount of data as a single OST may not\nhave enough free space to store all the data. For applications creating a large\nnumber of small files as with a file per process scheme, large stripe counts\ncan cause overhead and impede the performance.\n\n- when multiple processes access the same large file in parallel set a stripe\n  count >1 and an integral factor of the number of processes.\n- with a file-per-process I/O pattern\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
