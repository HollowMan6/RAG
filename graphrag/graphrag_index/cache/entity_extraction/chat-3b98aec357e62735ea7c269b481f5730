info\n\n    The following tools must be installed:  \n    - [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)  \n    - python-openstackclient (`pip install python-openstackclient`)  \n    - python-heatclient (`pip install python-heatclient`)  \n\nFirst, you can create a `heat_params.yaml` that will contains different variables use for your instance. Use your own value:  \n\n```yaml\nparameter_defaults:\n  ssh_key_name:\n  vm_flavor:\n  vm_image:\n  vm_network:\n  count:\n```\n\nSecond, two Openstack Heat templates. For the first one, we'll take our previous examples with some modifications. We call it `heat_stack_vm.yaml`:  \n\n```yaml\nheat_template_version: rocky # As mentioned above, you can either use the date or the name\n\ndescription: Simple template to deploy a single or several instance(s) in cPouta\n\nparameters: # Since we created a heat_params.yaml, they will be retrieved from this file\n  ssh_key_name:\n    description: SSH key name\n    type: string\n  vm_name:\n    description: Name for the VM\n    type: string\n  vm_flavor:\n    description: Flavor for the VM\n    type: string\n  vm_image:\n    description: Image for the VM\n    type: string\n  vm_network:\n    description: Network for the VM\n    type: string\n\nresources:\n  instance:\n    type: OS::Nova::Server\n    properties:\n      name: { get_param: vm_name } # This value will be retrieved from servers_group.yaml file. See after.\n      image: { get_param: vm_image }\n      flavor: { get_param: vm_flavor }\n      key_name: { get_param: ssh_key_name }\n      networks:\n        - network: { get_param: vm_network }\n\noutputs:\n  network:\n    description: Output the networks of instance\n    value: { get_attr: [instance, networks] }\n```\n\nThird, we'll create a file called `servers_group.yaml`, a [ResourceGroup](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/latest/template_guide/openstack.html#OS::Heat::ResourceGroup), which allows us to scale our instances:  \n\n```yaml\nheat_template_version: rocky\n\ndescription: Resource Group to deploy one or several instance(s)\n\nparameters: # Parameter retrieves from heat_params.yaml file.\n  count:\n    description: Number of resources\n    type: string\n\nresources:\n  instances_group:\n    type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup\n    properties:\n      count: { get_param: count }\n      resource_def:\n        type: heat_stack_vm.yaml # We defined our previous template.\n        properties:\n          vm_name: test-stack-%index% # Value %index% will be increased if more than one vm is created.\n\noutputs:\n  print_out:\n    value: { get_attr: [instances_group, network] }\n```\n\nAnd finally, we'll create an ansible script that will build and deploy our vm(s). Let's call it `build-heat-stack.yaml`:  \n\n```yaml\n- hosts: localhost\n  gather_facts: false\n  vars:\n    heat_environment_file: \"heat_params.yaml\" # Be sure that the file is located at the same level as build-heat-stack.yaml\n\n  tasks:\n    - name: Build a Heat stack VM\n      register: heat_stack\n      os_stack:\n        name: \"{{ stack_name }}\"\n        state: present\n        template: \"servers_group.yaml\" # Be sure that the file is located at the same level as build-heat-stack.yaml\n        environment: \n          - \"{{ heat_environment_file }}\"\n\n    - name: Print out network\n      debug:\n        var: heat_stack\n```\n\nSource your cPouta project (`source project_xxxxx.sh`) and run the command:   \n```sh\nansible-playbook -e stack_name=\"test-stack\" build-heat-stack.yaml`\n```\n\nIf everything went well, you can check that the stack was created, either using the web interface of cPouta or typing the command: `openstack stack list`.  \nYou can also check the instance(s) created: `openstack server list`.  \n\nIf you delete the stack, all the resources created from it will be deleted as well.\n\n### Heat guidelines and command references\n\nFor more information, visit the OpenStack [Heat wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat).
