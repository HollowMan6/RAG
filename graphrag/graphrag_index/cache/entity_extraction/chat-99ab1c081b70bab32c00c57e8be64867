Copy the token.\n\n3. **Add the Token to Rahti:**\n    - Under \"Source Secret\" choose \"Create new Secret\"\n    - Name the secret, under \"Authentication type\" choose \"Basic Authentication\"\n    -

Open a terminal and run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair:\n         ```sh\n         ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n         ```\n    - This will create two files: a private key (`id_rsa`) and a public key (`id_rsa.pub`).\n\n2. **Add Your Public Key to Your Git Hosting Service:**\n\n    - **GitHub:**\n        - Go to your GitHub account settings.\n        - Navigate to \"SSH and GPG keys\".\n        - Click \"New SSH key\" and paste the contents of your `id_rsa.pub` file.\n\n    - **GitLab:**\n        - Go to your GitLab profile settings.\n        - Navigate to \"SSH Keys\".\n        - Add a new SSH key and paste the contents of your `id_rsa.pub` file.\n\n4. **Add the Private SSH Key to Rahti:**\n    - Under \"Source Secret\" choose \"Create new Secret\"\n    - Name the secret, under \"Authentication type\" choose \"SSH Key\"\n    - Paste the contents of your private SSH key (`id_rsa`) and create\n    -

Unfortunately, it's not possible to set resource limits and requests directly from the CLI when deploying the app. You will need to use a YAML configuration file or the web UI to specify these settings.\n\nYou can create a yaml file and then apply it with the command `oc apply -f {your_yaml_file}.yaml` or edit your current `BuildConfig` in the Rahti 2 webUI.  \nIn the Administrator view, navigate to `Builds > BuildConfigs` and click on your BuildConfig. Select the `YAML` tab.  \n\nUnder `spec` you should see `resources: {}`. From here, add `limits.cpu`, `limits.memory`, `requests.cpu` and `requests.memory`:\n```yaml\nresources:\n  limits:\n    cpu: 400m\n    memory: 8Gi\n  requests:\n    cpu: 50m\n    memory: 1600Mi\n```\n\nNote that they cannot be more than 5x apart (default ratio, more information [here](../../usage/projects_and_quota/#default-pod-resource-limits)).\n\nSave and run the build again, and if it succeeds, check the metrics and see how much memory was used. You can adjust the memory limit to 10-20% more than what it was used.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
