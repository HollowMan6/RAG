If you use Allas on Puhti or Mahti, all required packages and software are already installed.\n```text\nmodule load allas\n\n```\nOpen a connection to Allas:\n```text\nallas-conf\n```\n\nThe _allas-conf_ command above asks for your CSC password (the same that you use to login to CSC servers). It lists your projects in Allas and asks you to define the project that will be used. _allas-conf_ generates and authenticates the connection to the selected project in Allas. The authentication information is stored in the shell variables *OS_AUTH_TOKEN* and *OS_STORAGE_URL* that are valid for up to eight hours. However, you can refresh the authentication at any time by running _allas-conf_ again. The environment variables are available only for that login session. If you open another session, you need to authenticate again to access Allas.\n\nThis chapter includes instructions for the following operations:\n\n| Swift command | Function |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| post | Create a bucket |\n| upload | Upload an object |\n| list | List objects and buckets |\n| download | Download objects and buckets |\n| copy | Move object |\n| delete | Remove objects or bucket |\n| download --all | Download whole project |\n| delete --all | Remove whole project |\n| md5sum | Get the checksum |\n| stat | View metadata |\n| stat --meta | Add metadata |\n| tempurl | Create a temporary URL |\n| post -r, -w, --read-acl | Manage access rights |\n| upload --use-slo | Upload files larger than 5 GB |\n\nYou can also install and use Swift outside the CSC computing environment. Make sure that your Swift version is not outdated, since the older Swift versions might not work with Allas.\n\n## Create buckets and upload objects\n\nCreate a new empty bucket:\n```text\nswift post <new_bucket_name>\n```\n\nCreate a new bucket and add a file to it:\n```text\nswift upload <new_bucket_name> <file_name>\n```\n\nAdd a file to an existing bucket:\n```text\nswift upload <old_bucket_name> <file_name>\n```\n**Note:** This might trigger the warning  \"_409 Conflict: BucketAlreadyExists_\", but that does not necessarily mean that the upload has failed. \nIf the next line displays the file name, the file was successfully uploaded to the existing bucket.\n\n```text\n$ swift upload my_fishbucket my_fish.jpg\nWarning: failed to create container 'my_fishbucket': 409 Conflict: BucketAlreadyExists\nmy_fish.jpg\n```\n\n## List objects and buckets\n\nList all buckets belonging to a project:\n```text\n$ swift list\nmy_fishbucket\nmy_bigfishes\n```\nList the content of a bucket:\n```text\n$ swift list my_fishbucket\nmy_fish.jpg\nsalmon.jpg\nbass.png\n```\n\n## Download objects and buckets\n\nDownload an object:\n```text\nswift download <bucket_name> <file_name>\n```\nIf you want to rename the object as you download it, you can include *-o new_name* in the end of the command:\n```text\nswift download <bucket_name> <file_name> -o <new_name>\n```\nDownload an entire bucket:\n```text\nswift download <bucket_name>\n```\n\n## Move objects\n\nYou can copy data from one bucket to another using the command `swift copy`. The command below copies _file.txt_ from _bucket1_ to _bucket2_.\n```text\nswift copy --destination /bucket2 bucket1 file.txt\n```\n**Note:** If there is no bucket called _bucket2_, Swift creates a new bucket with that name. However, even if there is a bucket called _bucket2_, Swift claims that it created a new one, even though it simply copied the file to the existing bucket:\n```text\n$ swift copy --destination /other_bucket my_bigfishes bigfish.jpg\ncreated container other_bucket\nmy_bigfishes/bigfish.jpg copied to /other_bucket/bigfish.jpg\n$ swift list other_bucket\nbigfish.jpg\nother_file.txt\n```\n\nRename a file while copying it:\n```text\n$ swift copy --destination /new_bucket/newname.jpg my_fishbucket my_fish.jpg\ncreated container new_bucket\nmy_fishbucket/my_fish.jpg copied to /new_bucket/newname.jpg\n```\n\nFor further information about the command _swift copy_, see the [OpenStack documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/latest/cli/index.html#swift-copy).\n\n## Remove objects and buckets\n\nRemove objects and buckets using the command `swift delete`:\n```text \nswift delete <bucket_name> <object_name>\n```\nFor example:\n```bash\n$ swift delete my_fishbucket useless_fish.jpg\nuseless_fish.jpg\n```\n\nUnlike with the web client and s3cmd, with Swift, you can **delete an entire bucket at once**:\n```text\nswift delete <my_old_bucket>\n```\nFor example:\n```text\n$ swift delete old_fishbucket\nold_fish.png\nuseless_salmon.jpg\ntoo_tiny_bass.jpg\n$ swift list old_fishbucket\nContainer u'old_fishbucket' not found\n```\n**Please note:** This deletes the bucket permanently, and the data is lost. Before using this command, make sure you do not need the data anymore or that you have a copy of the data.\n\n## Download or delete projects\n\nDownload the entire project:\n```text\nswift download --all\n```\n\nDelete the entire project:\n```text\nswift delete --all\n```\n**Please note:** Be careful with this\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
