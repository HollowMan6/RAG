How to speed up jobs\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 3\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/throughput/snakemake-ht.html\n---\n\n# Running Snakemake workflows at scale on Puhti\n\n> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that:\n\n- You have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).\n- Your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\nüí¨ Snakemake is a popular scientific workflow manager, especially within the\nbioinformatics community. The workflow manager enables scalable and\nreproducible scientific pipelines by chaining a series of rules in a\nfully-specified software environment.\n[Snakemake is available as a pre-installed module on Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/snakemake/).\n\n## Use containers as runtime environment \n\nüí¨ HPC-friendly containers like Singularity/Apptainer can be used as an\nalternative to native or Tykky-based installations for better portability and\nreproducibility. If you don't have a ready-made container image for your needs,\nyou can build a Singularity/Apptainer image on Puhti using `--fakeroot` option.  \n\n‚òùüèª For the purpose of this tutorial, a pre-built container image is provided\nlater to run Snakemake workflows at scale.\n\n## Use HyperQueue executor to submit jobs\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è If a workflow manager is using `sbatch` (or `srun`) for each process execution\n(i.e., a rule in Snakemake terminology), and the workflow has many short\nprocesses, it's advisable to use HyperQueue executor to improve throughput and\ndecrease load on the Slurm batch job scheduler.\n\n1. HyperQueue and Snakemake modules on Puhti can be loaded as below:\n   ```bash\n   module load hyperqueue/0.16.0\n   module load snakemake/8.4.6\n   ```\n\n   ‚ÄºÔ∏è Note! In case you are planning to use Snakemake on LUMI supercomputer, you\n   can use CSC module installations as below:\n\n   ```bash\n   module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles/\n   module load hyperqueue/0.18.0\n   module load snakemake/8.4.6\n   ```\n\n2. HyperQueue executor settings for a Snakemake workflow can be changed\n   depending on the version of Snakemake as shown below:\n\n   ```bash\n   # snakemake version 7.x.x\n   snakemake --cluster \"hq submit  ...\"\n   # snakemake version 8.x.x\n   snakemake --executor cluster-generic --cluster-generic-submit-cmd \"hq submit ...\"  \n   ```\n\n## Submit a Snakemake workflow on Puhti\n\n1. Create and enter a suitable scratch directory on Puhti (replace `<project>`\n   with your CSC project, e.g. `project_2001234`):\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /scratch/<project>/$USER/snakemake-ht\n   cd /scratch/<project>/$USER/snakemake-ht\n   ```\n\n2. Download the tutorial material, which has been adapted from the\n   [official Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/v6.6.1/executor_tutorial/google_lifesciences.html),\n   from Allas:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://a3s.fi/snakemake_scale/snakemake_scaling.tar.gz\n   tar -xavf snakemake_scaling.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n3. The downloaded material includes scripts and data to run a Snakemake\n   pipeline.
