Installing own software\ngrand_parent: Part 2\nnav_order: 7\nhas_children: false\nhas_toc: false\npermalink: /hands-on/installing/installing_cmake.html\n---\n\n# Installing using CMake\n\nðŸ’¬ CMake is an extensible, open-source software build system. CMake uses simple\n`CMakeLists.txt` configuration files placed in each source directory to \ngenerate standard `Makefile` build files. CMake generates a native build \nenvironment that will compile source code, create libraries, generate wrappers\nand build executable binaries in arbitrary combinations.\n\n## Preparations\n\nðŸ’¬ In this tutorial we'll use CMake to install a simple C++ Hello World\napplication.\n\n1. It is recommended to use the fast local disk when compiling software on CSC\n   supercomputers to move I/O load away from the parallel file system. Go there\n   and download the source code from Allas:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd $TMPDIR\n   wget https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/hello-cmake.tgz\n   ```\n\n2. Extract the package and move into the `hello-cmake` directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   tar xvf hello-cmake.tgz\n   cd hello-cmake\n   ```\n\n3. Most codes ship with a `README` or `INSTALL` file outlining the installation\n   procedure. When compiling other codes, start by reading these carefully. In\n   this case, the `README` just points to this tutorial page.\n4. Before compiling, one should ensure all the dependencies needed by the\n   software are available. Remember to always first check whether these can be\n   found on the CSC supercomputers as pre-installed modules. This example\n   depends on the Boost library, so check if it is available:\n\n   ```bash\n   module spider boost\n   ```\n\n5. Load the module with:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load boost/1.79.0\n   ```\n\n## Building with CMake\n\nðŸ’¡ When your build generates files, they have to go somewhere. An *in-source*\nbuild puts them in your source tree, while an *out-of-source* build puts them\nin a completely separate directory. The latter alternative, which is covered\nbelow, is typically recommended, as you can build multiple variants of the code\nin separate directories.\n\n1. Load the `cmake` module:\n\n   ```bash\n   module load cmake\n   ```\n\n2. Create and move to a `build` directory in the root of the source code:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   ```\n\n3. It is recommended to install own software under the `/projappl` directory\n   of your project. The installation directory can be specified using the\n   CMake flag `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to install dir>`. CMake also\n   requires you to specify the source code root directory, so run the `cmake`\n   command as:\n\n   ```bash\n   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/projappl/<project>/$USER/hello-cmake  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n4. If you get errors, try to fix the problems. For example, if you did not load\n   the `boost` module, you'll get an error `Could NOT find Boost`. Often it is\n   easiest to delete everything in the `build` directory and start from the\n   beginning after fixing all issues.\n5. After running `cmake`, run `make` to compile the application:\n\n   ```bash\n   make\n   ```\n   \n   ðŸ’¡ `make` can also be run in parallel. For example, to run using 8 cores,\n   use `make -j 8`. However, do not compile in parallel on the login node,\n   but use instead an interactive session. See CSC's\n   [usage policy](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/usage-policy/) for details.\n\n6. Finally, install into the specified directory under `/projappl` with:\n\n   ```bash\n   make install\n   ```\n\n7. Check what was installed and where:\n\n   ```bash\n   cat install_manifest.txt\n   ```\n\n## Test the installed application\n\n1. Own software installations are not automatically added to your `PATH`, which\n   means that the installed binaries (commands) cannot be used without\n   specifying the full path. To access the commands directly from anywhere, the\n   directory containing the binaries should be added to `PATH`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/projappl/<project>/$USER/hello-cmake/bin:$PATH\"  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n2. Try to run the program by typing:\n\n   ```bash\n   hi\n   ```\n\n3. You probably got an error like:\n\n   ```bash\n   hi: error while loading shared libraries: libhello.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n   ```\n   \n4. This happens because the program depends on a library file `libhello.so` and\n   does not know where to look for it. This is a quite common issue with\n   self-installed software. To fix the situation, add the `lib` path to the\n   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/projappl/<project>/$USER/hello-cmake/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234\n   ```\n\n5. Retry running the program, it should now work!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CMAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CMake is an extensible, open-source software build system that uses CMakeLists.txt files to generate Makefile build files for compiling source code, creating libraries, generating wrappers, and building executable binaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boost is a collection of portable C++ source libraries that works well with the C++ Standard Library)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC Supercomputers offer computing resources and recommend using the fast local disk for compiling software to move I/O load away from the parallel file system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELLO WORLD APPLICATION<|>EVENT<|>A simple C++ application that is used in this tutorial to demonstrate installing software using CMake on CSC supercomputers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CMAKE<|>HELLO WORLD APPLICATION<|>CMake is used to install the Hello World application in this tutorial<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOST<|>HELLO WORLD APPLICATION<|>The Hello World application depends on the Boost library for its compilation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTERS<|>HELLO WORLD APPLICATION<|>The Hello World application is compiled and installed on CSC supercomputers using CMake and Boost<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
