The Cray Fortran compiler supports the Fortran 2018 standard while\nthe C/C++ compiler is C17 and C++17 compliant. Invoking these compilers is done\nthrough the `ftn`, `cc` and `CC` [compilers wrappers][wrappers].\n\nCCE has support for the full OpenMP 4.5 specification as well as partial\nsupport for OpenMP 5.0. PGAS languages (UPC and Fortran coarrays) are also\nintegrated.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Feature                       | Fortran                   | C/C++           |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| HIP compilation               | Not available             | -xhip           |\n| Listing                       | -hlist=m                  | -fsave-loopmark |\n| Free format                   | -ffree                    | N/A             |\n| Vectorization                 | -O1 and above             | -O2 and above   |\n| Link Time Optimization        | -hwp                      | -flto           |\n| Floating-point optimizations  | -hfpN, N=0...4            | -ffp=N, N=0...4 |\n| Suggested Optimization        | default                   | -O3             |\n| Aggressive Optimization       | -O3 -hfp3                 | -Ofast -ffp=3   |\n| OpenMP recognition            | -fopenmp                  | -fopenmp        |\n| OpenACC recognition           | -hacc                     | Not available   |\n| Variable sizes                | -s real64<br>-s integer64 | N/A             |\n| Debug                         | -g                        | -g              |\n\n## Choose the CCE version\n\nThe Cray Compiling Environment is available from the `PrgEnv-cray` module which\nis loaded by default. This module loads the default version of the compilers. If\nyou wish to use an older or newer version, you can list the available version\nwith\n\n```bash\n$ module avail cce\n```\n\nand then switch to the desired version using\n\n```bash\n$ module swap cce cce/<version>\n```\n\n## OpenMP Support\n\n:material-help-circle-outline: `man intro_openmp`\n\nOpenMP **is turned off by default** which is the opposite of how earlier versions the CCE compilers worked.\nIt is turned on using the `-homp` or `-fopenmp` flag.\n\nThe CCE Fortran compiler allows controlling the level of optimization of OpenMP\ndirectives with the `-hthreadN` (`N = 0...3`). A value `N = 0` being off and `N\n= 3` specifying the most aggressive optimization. **The default value is `N =\n2`**.\n\n## OpenACC Support\n\n:material-help-circle-outline: `man intro_openacc`\n\nOpenACC is supported only by the Cray Fortran compiler. **The C and C++ \ncompilers have no support for OpenACC**. To enable OpenACC, use the `-hacc` \nflag.\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo ease a debugging process, it is useful to generate an executable containing\ndebugging information. For this purpose, you can use the `-g` option.\n\nMost of the time, the debug information works best at low levels of code\noptimization, so consider using the `-O0` level. The `-g` options can be\nspecified on a per-file basis so that only a small part of your application\nincurs the debugging penalty.\n\n## Compiler feedback\n\nThe compilers can generate loopmarks which indicate the type of optimization\nperformed. This feature is enabled by the `-hlist=m` option for the Fortran\ncompiler, and the `-fsave-loopmark` in the case of the C/C++ compilers. For\nexample\n\n=== \"Fortran\"\n    ```bash\n    $ ftn -fopenmp -hlist=m -o saxpy saxpy.f08\n    ```\n\n=== \"C\"\n    ```bash\n    $ cc -fopenmp -fsave-loopmark -Ofast -o saxpy saxpy.c\n    ```\n\n=== \"C++\"\n    ```bash\n    $ CC -fopenmp -fsave-loopmark -Ofast -o saxpy saxpy.cpp\n    ```\n\nwill produce a file called `saxpy.lst` where you can find a listing of your code\nwith annotations indicating which optimizations were performed by the compiler.\n\n=== \"Fortran\"\n\n    ```text\n        1.                   subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y) \n        2.                     real :: x(n), y(n), a\n        3.                     integer :: n, i\n        4.                   \n        5.    M----------<     !$omp parallel do\n        6.    M mVr2-----<     do i=1,n\n        7.    M mVr2             y(i) = a*x(i)+y(i)\n        8.    M mVr2----->     enddo\n        9.    M---------->     !$omp end parallel do\n      10.                   end subroutine saxpy\n    ```\n\n    The signification of the annotations can be found at the beginning of the \n    listing file. In our example, we can see for example that the compiler did \n    vector\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
