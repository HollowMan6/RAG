Puhti and Mahti have a\nfairly similar compute environment, and there is a wide range of\nworkloads that can utilize both efficiently. At the same time their\nhardware is different, and this makes some worklods uniquely suitable\nfor either Puhti or Mahti.\n\nIn addition to the national resources, CSC's data center in Kajaani hosts the pan-European pre-exascale supercomputer LUMI. The CPU-partition of LUMI has been available since early 2022, while the largest partition of the system consisting of GPU-accelerated nodes is projected to be available in late 2022.\n\n## LUMI\n\nLUMI is one of the three European pre-exascale supercomputers. It's an HPE Cray EX supercomputer consisting of several partitions targeted for different use cases. The largest partition of the system is the \"LUMI-G\" partition consisting of GPU accelerated nodes using a future-generation AMD Instinct GPUs. In addition to this, there is a smaller CPU-only partition, \"LUMI-C\" that features AMD EPYC \"Milan\" CPUs and an auxiliary partition for data analytics with large memory nodes and some GPUs for data visualization. Besides partitions dedicated to computation, LUMI also offers several storage partitions for a total of 117 PB of storage space.\n\n- [LUMI user documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/)\n\n- [A more technical description of LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/)\n\n- [How does LUMI-C differ from Mahti?](lumi-vs-mahti.md)\n\n## Puhti \n\nThe Puhti supercomputer, Atos BullSequana X400 cluster based on Intel\nCPUs, was launched on September 2, 2019. It has a powerful CPU\npartition with almost 700 nodes with a range of memory sizes and local\nstorage options, all connected with a fast interconnect. Puhti allows\nthe user to reserve compute and memory resources flexibly, and the\nuser can run anything from interactive single core data processing to\nmedium scale simulations spanning multiple nodes. \n\nThere are also 80 GPU nodes, with total of 320 Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs. This partition is\nsuitable for all kinds workloads capable of utilizing GPUs, even heavy\nAI models that span multiple nodes. \n\nPuhti has  wide selection of [scientific software](../apps/by_system.md#puhti) installed.\n\n- [A more technical description of Puhti](systems-puhti.md)\n\n## Mahti\n\nThe Mahti supercomputer, Atos BullSequana XH2000 system based on AMD\nCPUs, was launched on August 26, 2020. Mahti is designed for\nmassively parallel jobs requiring high floating point performance and\na fast interconnect. The system has in total 1404 nodes equipped with\npowerful AMD Rome CPUs. These are connected with a fast interconnect,\nallowing jobs to scale across the full system. In Mahti user reserves\nfull nodes so that the jobs can extract full performance from each\nnode. Mahti is in particular geared towards medium to large scale\nsimulations requiring Petaflops of compute power. Also smaller\nparellel workloads that are able to use full nodes efficiently can\nutilize Mahti. \n\nThere are also 24 GPU nodes, with total of 96 Nvidia Ampere A100 GPUs. This partition is\nsuitable for all kinds workloads capable of utilizing GPUs, even heavy\nAI models that span multiple nodes. A subset of the A100 GPUs are sliced into smaller GPUs \nwith one seventh of the compute and memory capacity of a full A100 GPU. These can be used for \ninteractive workloads, courses and code development.\n\nThe selection of installed [scientific software](../apps/by_system.md#mahti) in\nMahti is more limited than in Puhti.\n\n- [A more technical description of Mahti](systems-mahti.md)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
