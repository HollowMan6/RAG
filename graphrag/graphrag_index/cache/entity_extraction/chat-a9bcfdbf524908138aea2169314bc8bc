This message will be identified with a code looking like\n`ftn-<number>`. You can pass this identifier as an argument to the `explain`\ncommand to find out more about the error.\n\n```bash\n$ ftn -fopenmp -o saxpy saxpy.f08\n    call saxpy(2**20, 2.0, x, y)\n    ^                            \nftn-954 crayftn: ERROR MAIN, File = saxpy.f08, Line = 18, Column = 5 \n  Procedure \"SAXPY\", defined at line 1 (saxpy.f08) must have an explicit\n  interface because one or more arguments have the assumed-shape \n  DIMENSION attribute.\n\n$ explain ftn-954\n<explain output>\n```\n\n## CCE Fortran Compiler\n\n:material-help-circle-outline: `man crayftn`\n\nOnce the `PrgEnv-cray` module is loaded (by default) you can invoke the Cray\nFortran compiler with the `ftn` command.\n\n### Optimization options\n\nThe default optimization level of the CCE Fortran compiler is `-O2`. Aggressive\noptimization can be enabled with the `-O3` option.\n\n#### Vectorization\n\nThe level of automatic vectorizing is controlled with the `-hvectorN` option\n(`N = 0...3`).\n\n- the default value is `N = 2` enabling moderate vectorization and loop nests\n  restructuring\n- setting `N = 0` or `N = 1` enable minimal and moderate automatic vectorization\n  respectively\n- aggressive optimization is enabled by setting `N = 3`\n\n#### Loop unrolling\n\nLoop unrolling can be controlled with the `-hunrollN` flag with `N = 0...2`.\n\n- the default value is `N = 2` for which the compiler will attempt to unroll\n  all loops, except those marked with the `NOUNROLL` directive.\n- setting `N = 0` requests that no loop unrolling is performed (also ignore the\n  `UNROLL` directives).\n- if you only want to unroll loops that are marked by the `UNROLL` directive use\n  `N = 1`.\n\n#### Floating point optimizations\n\nThe Cray compiler is aggressive by default in the floating-point optimization.\nIf your application is sensitive to the floating-point optimization, use the\n`-hfpN` flag with `N = 0...4` to set the level of optimization.\n\n- the default value is `N = 2` which performs various generally safe,\n  nonconforming IEEE optimizations\n- most applications can benefit from more aggressive optimization with `N = 3`\n- use the value of `N = 0` or `N = 1` if the application you are compiling\n  requires strong IEEE standard conformance\n\n## CCE C and C++ compilers\n\n:material-help-circle-outline: `man craycc` - `man crayCC` - `clang --help`\n\nOne the `PrgEnv-cray` module is loaded (by default) you can invoke the Cray C\ncompiler with the `cc` command. The C++ compiler may be invoked with the `CC`\ncommand. These compilers are based on Clang/LLVM with Cray improvements. The\nCray improvements can be turned off with the `-fno-cray` flag.\n\nClang does not apply optimizations unless they are requested. Most optimizations\nare enabled using the `-O2` level. Recommended flags are\n\n- `-Ofast` to enable all the optimizations including aggressive optimizations\n   that may violate strict compliance with language standards\n- `-flto` to enable aggressive link time optimizations\n\nFor applications that are sensitive to floating−point optimizations, it may be\nrecommended to use `-O3` instead of `-Ofast`. These floating−point optimizations\ncan also be controlled with the `−ffp=N` flag with `N = 0...4`.\n\n- using `−ffp=0`, will generate code with the highest precision and grants the\n  compiler minimal freedom to optimize floating−point operations. Using\n  `-ffp=0` will prevent the use of Cray math libraries.\n- requesting the highest\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
