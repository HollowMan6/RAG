(WCAG 1.1.1)\n* Dropdown arrows in the main navigation do not have alternative text. (WCAG 1.1.1)\n\n### Videos\n\n* Video embeds are missing text alternatives and accessible names. (WCAG 1.1.1)\n\n### Language\n\n* The language of some software tutorials relies on visual characteristics of the software in question, such as location or shape of icons. (WCAG 1.4.8)\n\n### Structure\n\n* Highlight boxes have a visual heading which is not marked up as a heading in code. (WCAG 1.3.1)\n* Page titles in the Application section are not always descriptive and do not match the visual heading of the page. (WCAG 2.4.2)\n\n### Navigation\n\n* The currently focused item can sometimes be hidden beneath the fixed menu bar at the top of the page. (WCAG 2.4.7)\n* There are navigation regions on the page without unique labels, which can make them less useful for users of assistive technology. (WCAG 1.3.1)\n\n### The search function has some issues which can make it harder to use for people with disabilities:\n\n* All the subheadings of search results are incorrectly marked up as main headings (h1’s). (WCAG 1.3.1)\n* The search field does not have a programmatically associated label. (WCAG 1.3.1, 3.3.2)\n* The form has no submit button and no prior warning indication for users who are blind that search results are displayed immediately beneath the form. (WCAG 3.2.2)\n* Moving keyboard focus out of the search field causes search results to disappear. (WCAG 1.4.13)\n* The search is announced as a web dialogue to assistive technology users, but does not follow the correct specification for web dialogues, which can make screen reader use confusing. (WCAG 4.1.1.)\n* The search field remains active when navigating the page with arrow keys in a screen reader, which can be an issue for sighted screen reader users. (WCAG 1.4.13)\n* The structure of search results is not available for screen reader users. (WCAG 1.3.1)\n\n### Content which is not within the scope of the applicable legislation\n\n* Videos published before September 23rd, 2020.\n* PDF documents published before September 23rd, 2018.\n\n### Preparation of this accessibility statement\n\nThis statement was prepared on 10th December 2020.\n\nIt is based on an assessment carried out by a third-party evaluation of the website's compliance with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2016/2102.\n\nThis statement was last reviewed on 10th December 2020.\n\n### Feedback and contact information\n\nDid you notice an accessibility issue on our website? Please send us an email to [webmaster@csc.fi](mailto:webmaster@csc.fi)\n\n### Enforcement procedure\n\nIf you notice any accessibility issues on the site, please first send feedback to us, i.e. the site administrator.
