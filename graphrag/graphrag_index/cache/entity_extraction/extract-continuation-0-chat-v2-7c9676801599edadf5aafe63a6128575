Before you do an upgrade you need to be aware of the risks and implications. Upgrading the database will cause a short downtime. The downtime might depend on the version upgrade and how large database you have. It is a good idea to test the upgrade first by creating a new database instance from a backup and upgrade the new database instance first, or just continue using the new database instance. This allows you to better understand the implications.\n\nWhen you do a database upgrade,\n\n1. Your database instance will pull the new database version.\n2. Your database instance will stop your database.\n3. Your database instance will start the new database version.\n\nAt the moment it is not possible to upgrade a database instance from the web interface, you must use the CLI-tool.\n\nThe commands to use:\n\n1. Figure out which database you want to upgrade, take note of the `Datastore` and `Datastore Version`:\n\n    ```\n    openstack database instance list\n    ```\n\n2. With your preferred tool make sure that your database is working as expected. Take note on what command you used so that you can use the same command/process to verify that everything works after the upgrade.\n3. Find out what datastore versions are available:\n\n    ```\n    openstack datastore version list $Datastore\n    ```\n\n4. You most likely want to choose the latest version:\n\n    ```\n    openstack database instance upgrade $Instance $Datastore_version\n    ```\n\n5. Verify with your preferred tool that your database is working as expected.\n\n## Deleting a database in your database instance\n\nBy default, your database user account does not have permissions to delete databases. If you want to delete a database in your database instance you need to use the web-GUI or the OpenStack CLI:\n\n```\nopenstack database db delete $INSTANCE_UUID $DATABASE_NAME\n```\n\n\n## Enable root\n\nSome changes, such as enabling extensions or modifying more advanced user permissions,\naren't accessible via the web interface or the OpenStack command line tools.\nIt's worth keeping in mind that with the root credentials enabled you can make\nbreaking changes to your database. It's recommended to only use the root user when\nyou need to make changes that actually require it.\n\n### How to enable root from the Web interface\n\n1. Log in to the web interface where you can see all your existing instances.\n2. Find the 'Actions' dropdown in the rightmost column, and choose `Manage Root Access`. ![Manage root access](../../img/dbaas-enable-root.png)\n3. On the Manage Root Access page, press the `Enable Root` button in the rightmost column of the instances table.\n4. The root password is now visible on that same Manage Root Access page. You can access the database with the password shown, and with `root` as username.\n5. Once you no longer need root access, press `Disable Root` on the Manage Root Access page.\n\n### How to enable root from the CLI\n\n\n1. Enable root\n    ```\n    openstack database root enable $INSTANCE_ID\n    ```\n\n2. Use the password shown with the username `root` to access the database.\n\n3. Once you no longer need root access, run the following command to disable it:\n\n    ```\n    openstack database root disable $INSTANCE_ID\n    ```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DBAAS SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides tools for database upgrades and maintenance, including handling version upgrades and enabling root access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATABASE INSTANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific database within the DBaaS service that can be upgraded or deleted using provided tools)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Offers command line tools for database management, including upgrades, deletions, and root access management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A graphical interface for managing database instances, including enabling root access)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DBAAS SERVICE<|>DATABASE INSTANCE<|>The DBaaS service provides the environment in which database instances are managed<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATABASE INSTANCE<|>OPENSTACK<|>Database instances are managed using OpenStack command line tools<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEB INTERFACE<|>DATABASE INSTANCE<|>The web interface offers a method to manage database instances, including enabling root access<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>WEB INTERFACE<|>OpenStack provides the backend functionality that can be accessed through the web interface for database management<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
