The output file will be\nalmost 105 GB. We use 256 processes, 16 per compute node.\n\nExecuting with default settings, from the output of the benchmark:\n\n```\nI/O bandwidth    :    1292.96 MiB/s\n```\n\n#### Striping\n\nWe know that the Lustre striping is 1 MB, thus we set this in a file called\n`romio`\n\n```\nstriping_unit 1048576\n```\n\nand provide ROMIO hint:\n\n```\nexport ROMIO_HINTS=/path/romio\n```\n\nWhen executing the benchmark again we get:\n\n```\nI/O bandwidth    :    2939.85 MiB/s\n```\n\nThe performance is improved by a factor of 2.27.\n\n\n#### MPI I/O Aggregators\n\nBy default there is one MPI I/O aggregator per compute node, so we increase it\nto two by adding to the `romio` file:\n\n```\ncb_config_list *:2\n```\n\nWhen executing the benchmark again and we have now:\n\n```\nI/O bandwidth    :    3699.31 MiB/s\n```\n\nThe performance is improved in total by factor of 2.86.\n\n#### Increasing the number of Lustre OSTs\n\nIf we use two Lustre OSTs without any ROMIO hints, the performance is\n3500 MiB/s, which is less than the previous result.\n\nWhen using 2 OSTs with the `romio` file\n\n```\nstriping_unit 1048576\nromio_cb_write enable\nromio_no_indep_rw true\nromio_ds_write disable\n```\n\nperformance is increased to 4667 MiB/s, an increase of 33%. In this\ncase, increasing the number of the aggregators does not improve the\nperformance.\n\nOverall, the effect of ROMIO hints depends on the application and the used\nhardware, the optimum parameters are not necessarily the same across various\napplications.\n\n### Non-Blocking I/O\n\nWe create an input file for non-blocking PnetCDF with:\n\n```\nw                  # IO mode:    w for write, r for read\n3                  # IO method:  0 for MPI collective I/O, 1 for MPI_independent I/O,\n                   # 2 for PnetCDF blocking I/O, 3 for PnetCDF nonblocking I/O\n5                  # number of time steps\n2048 1024 256      # grid_points(1), grid_points(2), grid_points(3)\n/scratch/project_xxxxx/BTIO/output # output file\n```\n\nWith the default ROMIO parameters the performance is 1820 MiB/s for 1 OST,\nwhich is quite low for 16 compute nodes.\n\nNext, we setup the `romio` file:\n\n```\nstriping_unit 1048576\ncb_config_list *:4\nromio_ds_write disable\n```\n\nThe achieved performance is 4565 MiB/s, this is 2.5 times improvement.\n\nIf we use 2 OSTs with the same `romio file`, the performance is 9520 MiB/s\nwhich is more than twice that with 1 OST and more than twice than with\nblocking I/O. With the default parameters, the achieved performance would be\n7772 MiB/s, so the hints boost the performance by 22.5%.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n* First, verify that your I/O causes issues or it takes significant time from\n  your total execution.\n* Then, try to use I/O libraries such as\n  [PNetCDF](https://parallel-netcdf.github.io/),\n  [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/),\n  [ADIOS](https://csmd.ornl.gov/software/adios2).\n* Use non-blocking I/O for more efficient I/O\n* Lustre striping and ROMIO hints can improve performance a lot.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
