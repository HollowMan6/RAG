Note\n    For an overview of the LUMI supercomputer, see [the LUMI\n    documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/).\n\nPuhti and Mahti are CSC's supercomputers. Puhti has been available for CSC users\nsince 2 September 2019 and Mahti has been available since 26 August 2020. LUMI is\none of the pan-European pre-exascale supercomputers, located in CSC's data\ncenter in Kajaani. The CPU partition of LUMI (LUMI-C) has been available since\nearly 2022, and the full system with the large LUMI-G partition has been available since early 2023.\n\nPuhti contains CPU nodes with a range of memory sizes as well as a large GPU\npartition (Puhti AI), while Mahti contains homogeneous CPU nodes and is meant\nfor larger jobs (minimum 128 CPU-cores). Mahti also contains a GPU partition\nsince 2021 (Mahti AI) with Nvidia Ampere GPUs. See [specifications](available-systems.md)\nfor details on the systems and [this page for an outline of differences between LUMI-C and\nMahti](lumi-vs-mahti.md).\n\nCSC supercomputers use the Linux operating system and we recommend that you are familiar with\nbasics of [Linux command line usage](../support/tutorials/env-guide/index.md) before starting.\n\n## Accessing Puhti and Mahti\n\nTo be able to use CSC's supercomputers, you need to have a CSC user account that\nbelongs to a computing project which has access to the respective supercomputers.\nCSC user accounts and projects are managed in the [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi).\nFurther instructions are provided in the [Accounts section](../accounts/index.md)\nof this user guide.\n\n!!! Note\n    To access the LUMI supercomputer, you need to [create a LUMI-specific\n    project](../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md#creating-a-lumi-project-and-applying-for-resources).\n    For more details on getting started with LUMI, see the [LUMI\n    documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/getstarted/).\n\n## Connecting to the supercomputers\n\nConnect using an ssh client:\n\n```bash\nssh yourcscusername@puhti.csc.fi\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nssh yourcscusername@mahti.csc.fi\n```\n\nThis will connect you to one of the login nodes. If you need to connect\nto a specific login node, use the command:\n\n```bash\nssh yourcscusername@puhti-login<number 11-12,14-15>.csc.fi\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nssh yourcscusername@mahti-login<number 11-12>.csc.fi\n```\n\nWhere `yourcscusername` is the username you get from CSC.\n\nFor more details, see the [connecting](connecting/index.md) page.\n\nPuhti can also be accessed via the [Puhti web interface](webinterface/index.md)\navailable at [www.puhti.csc.fi](https://www.puhti.csc.fi).\n\n### Scalability\n\nDon't allocate more resources to your job than it can use efficiently. This\nneeds to be verified for each new code and job type (different input) by a\nscaling test. The policy is that the job should be **at least 1.5 times faster**\nwhen you double the resources (cores). [Instructions for performing a scalability\ntest](../../support/tutorials/cmdline-handson/#scaling-test-for-an-mpi-parallel-job).\nPlease also consider [other important factors related to performance.](performance.md)\n\n## Projects and quotas\n\nWorking in CSC supercomputers is based on projects. The computing and storage\nresources are allocated to projects and when you start a batch job, you must\nalways define the project that the job belongs to.\n\nProjects are managed in the [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi), where you can add\nservices, resources and users to your CSC projects.\n\nIn CSC supercomputers, you can check your currently active projects with the\ncommand:\n\n```text\ncsc-projects\n```\n\nThis command shows information for all your CSC projects. You can select just\none project to be reported with the `-p` option. For example:\n\n```bash\n[kkayttaj@puhti ~]$ csc-projects -p project_2012345\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nProject: project_2012345    Owner: Kalle Käyttäjä\nTitle: \"Ortotopology modeling\"\nStart: 2015-12-17 End: 2022-03-16 Status: open\nBudget:   1174188  Used   1115284 Remain:      58904\nLatest resource grant: 2019-03-04\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nThe command reports the owner of the project, title, start and end dates. In\naddition the command prints out the budgeting information for the project: how\nmany billing units have been granted to your project, how many have been used\nand how many still remain.\n\nThe [disk areas](disk.md) of your projects can be checked with the command:\n\n```text\ncsc-workspaces\n```\n\n## Using Puhti and Mahti\n\n* [Systems](available-systems.md): What computational resources are available\n* [Usage policy](usage-policy.md): Usage policy of CSC supercomputers\n* [Connecting](connecting/index.md): How to connect to  CSC supercomputers\n* [Puhti web interface](webinterface/index.md): How to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of CSC's supercomputers, available since 2 September 2019, featuring CPU nodes, a range of memory sizes, and a large GPU partition known as Puhti AI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is another of CSC's supercomputers, available since 26 August 2020, designed for larger jobs with homogeneous CPU nodes and a GPU partition with Nvidia Ampere GPUs since 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a pan-European pre-exascale supercomputer located in CSC's data center in Kajaani, with its CPU partition available since early 2022 and the full system since early 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC is the organization that operates Puhti, Mahti, and LUMI supercomputers, providing computational resources to users with a CSC account)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAJAANI<|>GEO<|>Kajaani is the location of CSC's data center that houses the LUMI supercomputer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is the operating system used on CSC supercomputers, and users are recommended to be familiar with Linux command line usage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCSC PORTAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MyCSC portal is an online platform where CSC user accounts and projects are managed)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>CSC<|>Puhti is operated by CSC and available for CSC users<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>CSC<|>Mahti is operated by CSC and available for CSC users<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>CSC<|>LUMI is operated by CSC and located in their data center in Kajaani<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>KAJAANI<|>LUMI is located in CSC's data center in Kajaani<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>LINUX<|>Puhti uses the Linux operating system<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>LINUX<|>Mahti uses the Linux operating system<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMI<|>LINUX<|>LUMI uses the Linux operating system<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MYCSC PORTAL<|>CSC manages user accounts and projects through the MyCSC portal<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
