More about that in [Data organization](#data-organization).\n\n!!! note \"Data documentation can be done by using:\"\n    - (domain specific) metadata and data standards \n    - electronic laboratory notebooks\n    - dictionaries and vocabularies\n    - readme-files \n    \n    and they all take part in explaining what the project data is and what it means.\n\n## Semantic interoperability and machine-readability\n\n**Controlled vocabularies, thesauri, and ontologies** are all so called semantic artefacts, which are machine-readable models of knowledge. When a data standard and schema express the data structure (the relations of different elements in the data), semantic artefacts make the meaning of the content unambiguous and 'understandable' to a machine (machine actionable). For example, when you collect data about plants it may be obvious to other human readers, that the data is about living organisms and not about power plants and other factories, but a computer can't distinguish the difference by interpreting the meaning from the context as humans can. For this purpose, data should be accompanied by or refer to a publicly available vocabulary that tells a machine how to interpret the data in the context, and what values in the variables mean (for example are the numbers in the \"Degrees\" column Fahrenheit or Celsius degrees). It is also important to let the machine know whether an empty field, NULL, or zero means zero value, or if the data is simply missing. It can be crucial to the analyses and results if data is (mis)interpreted in different ways when reusing or merging datasets. \n\n!!! note \"Links to controlled vocabularies, thesauri, and ontologies\"\n    - [Finnish Thesaurus and Ontology Service (Finto.fi)](https://finto.fi/en/)\n    - [National checklist of Finnish species (Laji.fi)](https://laji.fi/en/taxon)\n    - [Basic Register of Thesauri, Ontologies & Classifications (BARTOC)](https://bartoc.org/)\n    - [CESSDA Vocabulary Service](https://vocabularies.cessda.eu/)\n    - [Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV)](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov)\n    - [The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/)\n    - [Repository of biomedical ontologies (BioPortal)](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)\n    - [NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS)](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/)\n    - [Research Vocabulary Australia](https://vocabs.ardc.edu.au/)\n    - [Marine Metadata Interoperability Ontology Registry and Repository (MMI ORR)](https://mmisw.org/)\n    - [Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF)](https://www.industrialontologies.org/)\n    \n    \n<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" srcdoc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9m4montnF0\" title=\"Elements of FAIR - Interoperability\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n## Data organization\n\nImportant part of good data management is also taking care of data organization. This includes for example thoughtful file naming, clear folder structure, accessible file formats and explicit version control.\n\nIt is good practice to make a clear **file naming system** from the start of your project and for example use the same system together with your research team. This helps you as well as your colleagues to understand what files contain from the name. Read tips for organizing your data and naming files and folders below or from [RDMKit Data Organisation page](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_organisation.html). \n\nYour research field might also have instructions and guidelines for organizing data. Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), for example, has been created by the scientific community of brain researchers, and it defines the file formats, file naming rules and rules to organize the data in directories.\n\n### Versioning\n\nTo keep data well-organized you should have a **version control system** in use. This can either be done manually, where you incorporate a running number to the end of a file name _(_v03)_, or automatically, which is the preferred way. Automatic version control can be done with software such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) (your institution might offer an integrated solution) or use cloud storing solutions, which usually provide automatic file versioning. More tips on data organization can be found in [the ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/).\n\nWhen making new versions of data files, it is important to **keep a copy of the original raw data**. Data should be kept in its raw form whenever possible to enable transparency and facilitate reanalysis. It also assists in combining multiple data sources and re-purposing the data use. Also, when sharing the data it might be worthwhile to provide both unprocessed and processed versions of your data, with either code or explanations for deriving the latter. In some cases it is even possible to publish the data with the processing and analyses code as an executable paper in order to prove that the scientific process is reproducible. In other words, executable papers are dynamic pieces of software that combine text, raw data, and the code used for the analysis, and that a reader can interact with. \n\n!!! note \"Learn more about reproducibility and executable research articles:\"\n    - [\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
