You can compare both strings and numbers. For\nexample, the following command prints data only when the third column is\n\"Tampere\":\n\n```bash\n$ awk '{if ( $3 == \"Tampere\")  print \"Location: \"$3\"\\tName: \"$1\" \"$2}' authors.txt\nLocation: Tampere       Name: Pekka Niemi.\n```\n\nAlternatively, the condition could be defined in the statement part\nbefore the `awk` commands:\n\n```bash\nawk ' $3 == \"Tampere\" {print \"Location: \"$3\"\\t Name: \"$1\" \"$2}' authors.txt\n```\n\nIf the columns contain numerical values, `awk` can also do numerical\noperations. For example, let's use `awk` to calculate how much disk\nspace jpg image files take in the current folder. We can first list the\njpg files with command: `ls -l *.jpg`\n\n```bash\n$ ls -l *.jpg\n-rw-------+ 1 kkayttaj csc   85112 Dec 19  2002 Image_2.jpg\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 kkayttaj csc  105542 Nov  6  2006 Screen.jpg\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 kkayttaj csc  167598 May 15  2008 casa1.jpg\n-rw-------+ 1 kkayttaj csc  550031 Mar 25  2008 hexa.jpg\n-rw-------+ 1 kkayttaj csc  869534 Dec 23  2005 img.jpg\n-rw-------+ 1 kkayttaj csc   19159 Jul 23  2003 kuva.jpg\n-rw-r-xr-x+ 1 kkayttaj csc  433268 Dec 23  2005 plot3.jpg\n-rw-------+ 1 kkayttaj csc 1591444 Jan 26 12:27 copy.jpg\n```\n\nTo sum up the values of the file sizes in the fifth column, we pipe the\noutput to `awk`:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -l *.jpg | awk '{total+=$5} END {print \"JPG files in total: \"total}'\nJPG files in total: 3821688\n```\n\nNote that in the `awk` command above the `total` is a variable name used\nby `awk`. The `END` defines that the following command is executed only\nwhen all input lines are processed. In the second `awk` command\nexample, we calculate and display a cumulative sum and average of ages\nfrom the file `authors.txt`.\n\n```bash\nawk '{ tot_age = tot_age + $4 }{ aver=tot_age/NR}{ print $0 \" cumulative age sum:\" tot_age \" average:\" aver}' authors.txt\n```\n\nHere we use the automatic `NR` row count variable to calculate the average\nage. This command prints out:\n\n```text\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50 cumulative age sum:50 average:50\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50 cumulative age sum:100 average:50\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26 cumulative age sum:126 average:42\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32 cumulative age sum:158 average:39.5\n```\n\n## Using `sort` to order rows\n\nThe `sort` command can be used to order rows of a text file or\nother input data into alphabetical or numerical order. The syntax of the\n`sort` command is simple: `sort -options files_to_sort`. By default, the\n`sort` command orders the rows of the file alphabetically using\ncase-sensitive sorting. With option `-f`, case-insensitive sorting is\nperformed. If the data contains columns separated by the space or\ntabulator character you can ask the sort command to use a certain column\n(or columns) for ordering the data. The columns to be used can be\nselected with the option `-k column_number`. For example, to sort\nthe data in the file `authors.txt` (the example file used previously in\nthis chapter), according to the family names that are located in the\nsecond column, use command\n\n```bash\nsort -k 2 authors.txt\n```\n\nthat prints out:\n\n```text\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\n```\n\nYou can also define other column separators with option `-t separator`. \nNote that by default, `sort` orders also numbers\nalphabetically. Option `-n` makes `sort` to use a numerical ordering\ninstead. The option `-r` reverses the order. Numerical sorting\naccording to the fourth column can now be done with the command\n\n```bash\nsort -k4 -n authors.txt\n```\n\nthat results in\n\n```text\nPekka Niemi. Tampere 26\nLeena Virtanen. Kuopio 32\nEeva Pekkanen. Oulu 50\nMarkus Aho. Turku 50\n```\n\nYou can also define several columns to be used for sorting. For\nexample, the following command uses the numerical order of the fourth\ncolumn as the primary sorting criteria (`-k4n`). In cases where\nseveral rows have the same value in the fourth column, the alphabetical\norder is used as the secondary sorting criteria (`-k2`):\n\n```bash\nsort -k4n -k2 authors.txt\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TAMPERE<|>GEO<|>A city mentioned in the context of filtering data with awk command)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEKKA NIEMI<|>PERSON<|>An author listed in the example, associated with Tampere)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JPG FILES<|>EVENT<|>An operation to calculate the total disk space used by jpg files in a directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EEVA PEKKANEN<|>PERSON<|>An author from Oulu, mentioned in the context of calculating cumulative age sum and average)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKUS AHO<|>PERSON<|>An author from Turku, mentioned in the context of calculating cumulative age sum and average)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEENA VIRTANEN<|>PERSON<|>An author from Kuopio, mentioned in the context of calculating cumulative age sum and average)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OULU<|>GEO<|>A city associated with author Eeva Pekkanen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURKU<|>GEO<|>A city associated with author Markus Aho)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUOPIO<|>GEO<|>A city associated with author Leena Virtanen)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEKKA NIEMI<|>TAMPERE<|>Pekka Niemi is associated with Tampere in the authors.txt file<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EEVA PEKKANEN<|>OULU<|>Eeva Pekkanen is associated with Oulu in the authors.txt file<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARKUS AHO<|>TURKU<|>Markus Aho is associated with Turku in the authors.txt file<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEENA VIRTANEN<|>KUOPIO<|>Leena Virtanen is associated with Kuopio in the authors.txt file<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
