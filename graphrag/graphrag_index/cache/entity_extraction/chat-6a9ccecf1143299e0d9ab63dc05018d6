They can be attached to or detached from virtual machines\nwhile they are running.\n\nPersistent volumes are using CEPH cluster. Regarding I/O performance, you should not use this kind of volume.\nIt will use network access to the volume therefore latency.\n\n## Creating and attaching a volume in the Pouta web interface\n\nPersistent volumes can be created using either the web interface or\nthrough the command line interface.\n\nIn the web interface, use the **Create volume** button on the\n*Volumes* page to create a new volume. You may then give a name and a\nsize for the volume (1 GB is the minimum). The only mandatory argument\nis the size of the volume.\n\n![Create persistent Volmume](../../img/create-volume-horizon.png)\n\n!!! Warning \"Avoid non-ASCII character in name or description\"\n    This is a know bug in the volume system. Volume creation will fail\n    if its name or description contains any non-ASCII characters (e.g., ä, ö, å, é, à, ñ, [CJK characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters), ...):\n\n    ![Unable to create volume](../img/Unable-to-create-volume.png)\n\n    And the volume will be stuck in \"Creating\":\n\n    ![Creating](../img/Creating.png)\n\n    The only way to delete a volume created with a non-ASCII character is\n    using the command line (see below).\n\nOnce the volume has been created, it can be attached to a running\nvirtual machine. One volume can be attached to only one virtual\nmachine at a time.\n\nTo attach a volume, first select the *Volumes* view in the Pouta web\ninterface. Click the arrow symbol next to the **Edit Volume** button\nfor the volume you want to attach and select **Manage\nattachments**. Select the instance (i.e. virtual machine) you want to\nattach the volume to in the **Attach to Instance** selector.\n\n![Attach persistent volume](../../img/volume-attach-horizon2.png)\n\n## Creating and attaching a volume with command line interface\n\nPersistent volumes can also be created and attached using the command\nline interface:\n\n```\nopenstack volume create --description \"<description>\" --size <size> <name>\n```\n\n!!! Warning \"Avoid non-ASCII characters in name or description\"\n    This is a know bug in the volume system. Volume creation will fail\n    if its name or description contains any non-ASCII characters, this\n    includes ääköset and any non-standard characters.\n\n    ```sh\n    $ openstack volume create --description='Déjà vu' --size 1 matrice\n    Error decoding your request. Either the URL or the request body contained characters that could not be decoded by Cinder. (HTTP 400) (Request-ID: req-7dc59e6f-eb29-4a5f-9cdc-4a44b177e3f2)\n    ```\n\n    The only way to delete a volume created with a non ASCII character is\n    using the command line (see below).\n\nList existing volumes:\n\n```\nopenstack volume list\n```\n\nList existing virtual machines to find the one to which you\nwant to attach a volume:\n\n```\nopenstack server list\n```\n\nWhen a volume's status is \"available\", you can attach it to a virtual\nmachine (you can use either names or IDs to refer to the VM and the\nvolume):\n\n```\nopenstack server add volume <virtual machine> <volume>\n```\n\n!!! info\n\n    Most volume types can only be attached to one virtual machine at a time.\n\n## Using attached volumes\n\nThe first time you use a attached volume it needs to be initialized.\n**This should ONLY be done the FIRST time you use it**, otherwise you\noverwrite all your data on the volume. First determine which device is\nyour volume.\n\nThe following is a simple usage example for creating a filesystem\non a volume and mounting the filesystem automatically after a\nreboot. Note that this is a simple example and there are many\ncooler ways to manage your file systems.\n\nOnce you have logged in to your virtual machine, you can list the\nvolumes:\n\n    sudo parted -l\n\nYou should be able to identify the volume based on its size. For this\nexercise, let us say it is `/dev/vdb`. First, we create a file\nsystem on it. We are going to\nuse *xfs* because we know it works well in Pouta:\n\n    sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb\n\nNow you can start using it. For example, to mount it under\n`/media/volume`, you first need to make sure that the path exists:\n\n    sudo mkdir -p /media/volume\n\nThen you can mount it:\n\n    sudo mount /dev/vdb /media/volume\n\nFinally, you need to change the ownership to be able to read and write data in it.\nIn the following command, we are assuming the username is cloud-user.\n\n    sudo chown cloud-user:cloud-user /media/volume\n\nAfter this step, you should be able to use your volume normally. If you want the volume to be available after rebooting the virtual machine, you need to add it in the `/etc/fstab` configuration file.\nYou can use the label you previously created for the partition:\n\n    sudo sh -c 'echo \"/dev/vdb     /media/volume    xfs    defaults,nofail    0    2\" >> /etc/fstab'\n\n## Detaching the volume\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
