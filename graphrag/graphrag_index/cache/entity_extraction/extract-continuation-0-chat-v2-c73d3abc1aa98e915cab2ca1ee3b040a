YAML files are recognized\nby the `.yml` or `.yaml` file suffix.\n\nA YAML dataset can be\n\n* a value\n\n```yaml\nvalue\n```\n\n* an array\n\n```yaml\n- value 1\n- value 2\n- value 3\n```\n\nor\n\n```yaml\n[value 1, value 2, value 3]\n```\n\n* a dictionary\n\n```yaml\nkey: value\nanother_key: another value\n```\n\n  or\n\n```yaml\nkey:\n  value\nanother_key:\n  another value\n```\n\n* YAML dataset\n\n```yaml\nkey:\n  - value 1\n  - another key:\n      yet another key: value 2\n    another key 2:\n      - more values\n    this keys value is also an array:\n    - but indentation is not necessary here\n```\n\nValues can be input across multiple lines using `>`:\n\n```yaml\nkey: >\n  Here's a value that is written over multiple lines\n  but is actually still considered a single line until now.\n\n  Placing double newline here will result in newline in the actual data.\n```\n\nVerbatim style is supported with the `|` character:\n\n```yaml\nkey: |\n  Now each\n  newline is\n  treated as such\n```\n\n## YAML vs JSON\n\nYAML is a superset of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Thus,\n\n```json\n{\n  \"key\": [\n    {\n      \"value 1\": {\n        \"another key\": {\n          \"yet another key\": \"value 2\"\n        },\n        \"another key 2\": [\n          \"more values\"\n        ],\n        \"this keys value is also an array\": [\"but indentation is not necessary here\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nis also valid YAML. In general YAML is more compact than JSON:\n\n```yaml\nkey:\n  - value 1:\n      another key:\n        yet another key: value 2\n      another key 2:\n        - more values\n      this keys value is also an array:\n        - but indentation is not necessary here\n```\n\n## yq command line tool\n\n`yq` is a useful tool to work with `yaml`. It can be installed using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/yq/):\n\n```bash\n$ pip show yq  \nName: yq\nVersion: 3.0.2\nSummary: Command-line YAML/XML processor - jq wrapper for YAML/XML documents\nHome-page: https://github.com/kislyuk/yq\nAuthor: Andrey Kislyuk\nAuthor-email: kislyuk@gmail.com\nLicense: Apache Software License\nLocation: /home/jtahir/Documents/csc-stuff/osclient/lib/python3.6/site-packages\nRequires: argcomplete, PyYAML, toml, xmltodict\nRequired-by: \n```\n\n`yq` is a `jq` wrapper, this means that it converts the yaml input to json and then handles the processing to `jq`, for this reason it has the same syntax as `jq`. In the example below, the value of `.data.WebHookSecretKey` is retrieved in raw mode (without quotes):\n\n```bash\n$ echo 'apiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\ndata:\n  WebHookSecretKey: dGhpc19pc19hX2JhZF90b2tlbgo=\nmetadata:\n  name: webhooksecret\n  namespace: mynamespace     # set this to your project namespace\n' | yq ' .data.WebHookSecretKey ' -r\ndGhpc19pc19hX2JhZF90b2tlbgo=\n```\n\nFor more information, see [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/) or [json.org](https://json.org).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>YAML is a data serialization language used to describe key-value maps and arrays, recognized by `.yml` or `.yaml` file suffix)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, which YAML is a superset of)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>`yq` is a command-line tool used to process YAML files, acting as a wrapper for `jq` to handle YAML input)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREY KISLYUK<|>PERSON<|>Andrey Kislyuk is the author of the `yq` command-line tool)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YAML<|>JSON<|>YAML is a superset of JSON, meaning all JSON syntax is valid in YAML but not vice versa<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YQ<|>YAML<|>`yq` is specifically designed to work with YAML files, processing them similarly to how `jq` works with JSON<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YQ<|>ANDREY KISLYUK<|>Andrey Kislyuk is credited as the author of the `yq` tool, linking him directly to its development and maintenance<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
