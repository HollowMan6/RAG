By default, the number of workers is the number of cores given by `availableCores()`. For guidelines on designing batch job files, see other examples on this page.\n\nThe R script below could be used to compare analysis times using sequential, multisession and multicore strategies. \n\n```r\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(tictoc)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\n# Different future plans (choose one) \n# (Note: three cores and thus three workers were used in this example)\n\n# plan(sequential)\n# plan(multisession)\n# plan(multicore)\n\n# Analysis timing\n\ntic()\nnothingness <- future_map(c(2, 2, 2), ~Sys.sleep(.x))\ntoc()\n\n# sequential: 6.157 sec\n# multisession: 2.463 sec\n# multicore: 2.212 sec\n```\n\nFor multi-node analyses using `plan(cluster)`, the job can be submitted using the package `snow`. As we are using `snow`, R must be launched using `RMPISNOW` and we should specify enough tasks for both the master and worker processes (see 'Jobs using `snow`'). To use `future` with `snow`, the following lines would also need to be included in the R script:\n\n```r\nlibrary(future)\n\ncl <- getMPIcluster()\nplan(cluster, workers = cl)\n\n# Analysis here\n\nstopCluster(cl)\n```\n\nFor practical examples of jobs using `plan(cluster)` and `plan(multicore)` with raster data, [see this page](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/puhti/02_parallel_future). \n\n*Jobs using `pbdMPI`*\n\nIn analyses using the `pbdMPI` package, each process runs the same copy of the program as every other process while operating on its own data. In other words, there is no separate master process as in `snow` or `doMPI`. Executing batch jobs using `pbdMPI` can be done using the `srun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript` command. For example, we could submit a job with four tasks divided between two nodes (with two tasks allocated to each node):\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_pbdmpi\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt\n#SBATCH --partition=test\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000\n\n# Load r-env\nmodule load r-env\n\n# Clean up .Renviron file in home directory\nif test -f ~/.Renviron; then\n    sed -i '/TMPDIR/d' ~/.Renviron\nfi\n\n# Specify a temp folder path\necho \"TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>\" >> ~/.Renviron\n\n# Run the R script\nsrun apptainer_wrapper exec Rscript --no-save --slave myscript.R\n```\n\nAs an example, this batch job file could be used to execute the following \"hello world\" script (original version available via the `pbdMPI` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/snoweye/pbdMPI)). The `init()` function initializes the MPI communicators while `finalize()` is used to shut them down and to exit R.\n\n```r\nlibrary(pbdMPI, quietly = TRUE)\n\ninit()\n\nmessage <- paste(\"Hello from rank\", comm.rank(), \"of\", comm.size())\ncomm.print(message, all.rank = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)\n\nfinalize()\n```\n\n#### Improving performance using threading\n\n`r-env` has been compiled using the Intel® Math Kernel Library (MKL), enabling the execution of data analysis tasks using multiple threads. For more information on threading, [see the Intel® website](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/mkl-linux-developer-guide/top/managing-performance-and-memory/improving-performance-with-threading.html). \n\nBy default, `r-env` is single-threaded. While users may set a desired number of threads for a job, the benefits of this in terms of computation times depend on the analysis. Because of this, we encourage experimenting with different thread numbers and benchmarking your code using a small example data set and, for example, the R package [`microbenchmark`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microbenchmark/index.html).\n\n!!! note\n    Note that simply adding more resources does not necessarily guarantee faster computation!\n\nThe module uses OpenMP threading technology and the number of threads can be controlled using the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. In practice, the number of threads is set to match the number of cores used for the job. Because `r-env` is based on an Apptainer container, when specifying the number of OpenMP threads we need to use the environment variable `APPTAINERENV_OMP_NUM_THREADS`.\n\nAn example batch job script can be found below. Here we submit a job using eight cores (and therefore eight threads) on a single node. Notice how we match the number of threads and cores using `APPTAINERENV_OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`. By using `APPTAINERENV_OMP_PLACES=cores`, we bind each thread to a single core. We also use `APPTAINERENV_OMP_PROC_BIND=close` to ensure that threads are placed as closely as possible (to allow faster communication between threads). Note that [other options](https://theartofhpc.com/pcse/omp-affinity.html) for controlling thread affinity are also available, depending on your analysis.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH --job-name=r_multith\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package in R for parallel computing, allowing different strategies like sequential, multisession, and multicore)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TICTOC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package in R used for timing code execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FURRR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package that provides tools for applying functions in parallel, using futures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for simple network of workstations, used for parallel processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RMPISNOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A configuration for launching R with the snow package for parallel processing using MPI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PBDMPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for programming with big data in MPI for high-performance statistical computing and profiling in R)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R-ENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An environment module for R, compiled with Intel® Math Kernel Library (MKL) for improved performance through threading)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEL® MATH KERNEL LIBRARY (MKL)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library that provides highly optimized, threaded, and vectorized functions to maximize performance on each processor family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROBENCHMARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An R package for accurate timing of R expressions, useful for benchmarking code performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An API that supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUTURE<|>SNOW<|>Future package can be used with snow for parallel processing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUTURE<|>PBDMPI<|>Future package can be integrated with pbdMPI for parallel processing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R-ENV<|>INTEL® MATH KERNEL LIBRARY (MKL)<|>R-env is compiled with Intel MKL for improved performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R-ENV<|>OPENMP<|>R-env uses OpenMP threading technology for parallel processing<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
