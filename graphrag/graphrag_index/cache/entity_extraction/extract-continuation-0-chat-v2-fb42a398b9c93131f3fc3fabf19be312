You can add your own `repos.yaml` file in the `~/.spack/` directory and then configure the path to your custom package directory inside that file:\n\n```\n$ cat ~/.spack/repos.yaml\nrepos:\n- /users/username/spack-packages\n```\n\nWhen `$SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG` is unset, Spack will read this configuration file and pick up your private Spack repository. You can verify that Spack is seeing the new package repository by running the `spack repo list` command:\n\n```\n $ spack repo list\n==> 2 package repositories.\ncustom     /users/username/spack-packages\nbuiltin    /pfs/lustrep3/appl/lumi/spack/23.03/0.20.0-user/var/spack/repos/builtin\n```\n\nMore information about creating package repositories is available in the [Spack documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html).\n\n## Further reading\n\n- [Spack documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n- [Spack tutorial](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)\n- [Spack Source code](https://github.com/spack/spack) (especially the package definitions)\n- [Spack Slack](https://slack.spack.io/)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spack is a package management tool used for installing, managing, and configuring software packages, with a focus on high-performance computing environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a computing environment or infrastructure where Spack modules are utilized, indicating a high-performance computing context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME/.SPACK/<|>GEO<|>A directory path in a user's home directory for overriding default Spack configuration settings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USERS/USERNAME/SPACK-PACKAGES<|>GEO<|>A custom package directory path for a user's private Spack repository)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PFS/LUSTREP3/APPL/LUMI/SPACK/23.03/0.20.0-USER/VAR/SPACK/REPOS/BUILTIN<|>GEO<|>The path to the built-in Spack package repository within the LUMI infrastructure)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOME/.SPACK/<|>SPACK<|>The HOME/.spack/ directory is used for user-specific Spack configuration overrides<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USERS/USERNAME/SPACK-PACKAGES<|>SPACK<|>The users/username/spack-packages path is a custom package repository for Spack managed by the user<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACK<|>LUMI<|>Spack is used within the LUMI computing environment for package management<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
