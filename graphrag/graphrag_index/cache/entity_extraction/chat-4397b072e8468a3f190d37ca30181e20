On the other hand, the browser user interface has a number of limitations compared to other clients, the most notable of which are lower performance and uploading/downloading only a single file at a time. Instructions for accessing and using Allas with a browser: [OpenStack Horizon web interface](./using_allas/web_client.md)\n\n3. To access Allas with command line commands, client software supporting the _Swift_ or _S3_ protocol is required. This is the most flexible way to access Allas, but it requires more effort than other access methods. Instructions to use a command line client: [Accessing Allas with Linux](./accessing_allas.md#accessing-allas-in-the-csc-computing-environment-and-other-linux-platforms).\n\n4. To access Allas with a GUI client, a suitable GUI client is required. The client needs to be capable to use the _Swift_ or _S3_ access protocol. Instructions to use a GUI client: [Accessing Allas with Windows and Mac](./accessing_allas.md#accessing-allas-with-windows-or-mac).\n\nSee also the [common use cases](./using_allas/common_use_cases.md).\n\n\n## Protocols\n\nThe object storage service is provided over two different protocols, _Swift_ and _S3_. From the user perspective, one of the main differences between S3 and Swift is authentication. The token-based Swift authentication used in Allas remains valid for eight hours at a time, but in the key-based S3, the connection can stay permanently open. The permanent connection of S3 is practical in many ways, but it includes a security aspect: if the server where Allas is used is compromised, the object storage space will be compromised as well.\n\nDue to this security concern, Swift is the recommended protocol for multiple-user servers such as Mahti and Puhti. Thus, for example, the CSC-specific _a-commands_, as well as the standard _rclone_ configuration in Puhti and Mahti, are based on Swift. However, in some cases, the permanent connections provided by the S3 protocol may be the most reasonable option, for example, in personal virtual machines running in cPouta.\n\nThe Swift and S3 protocols are <u>not</u> mutually compatible when handling objects. For small objects that do not need to be split during the upload, the protocols can be used interchangeably, but split objects can be accessed only with the protocol that was used for uploading them. The size limit for splitting an object depends on the settings and protocol. The limit is typically between 500 MB and 5 GB.\n\nGeneric recommendations for selecting the protocol:\n\n * If possible, use the _Swift_ protocol. It is better supported.\n * In any case, choose only one of the protocols. Do not mix _S3_ and _Swift_.\n * It is better to store a few large objects than many small objects.\n * Using over 100 GB objects may cause problems because of long upload/download times.\n\n## Clients\n\nAllas is accessed via a client software that takes care of moving data to and from Allas and managing data objects. There are several different kinds of client software for accessing the object storage servers. Allas can be used with any object storage client that is compatible with the Swift or S3 protocol.\n\n| Client | Notes |\n| :-------- | :------- |\n| [web client](./using_allas/web_client.md) | Use via [https://pouta.csc.fi](https://pouta.csc.fi).
