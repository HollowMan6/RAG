A typical Route definition would be:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1\nkind: Route\nmetadata:\n  name: <name-of-the-route>\nspec:\n  host: <host.name.dom>\n  to:\n    kind: Service\n    weight: 100\n    name: <name-of-service>\n  tls:\n    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect\n    termination: edge\nstatus:\n  ingress: []\n```\n\nThis will redirect any traffics coming to `<host.name.dom>` to the service `name-of-service`.\n\n* `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` is set to `Redirect`. This means that any traffic coming to port 80 (HTTP) will be redirected to port 443 (HTTPS).\n* `termination` is set to `edge`, This means that the route will manage the TLS certificate and decrypt the traffic sending it to the service in clear text. Other options for `termination` include `passthrough` or `reencrypt`.\n\nEvery host with the pattern `*.rahtiapp.fi` will automatically have a **DNS record** and a valid **TLS certificate**. It is possible to configure a Route with any given hostname, but a `CNAME` pointing to `rahtiapp.fi` must be configured, and a **TLS certificate** must be provided. See the [Custom domain names and secure transport](../tutorials/custom-domain.md) article for more information.\n\n#### Annotations\n\n* It is possible to use annotations to enable **IP whitelisting**, where only a few IP ranges are allowed to get through the **route** and the rest of the internet is blocked. Security-wise, it is highly encouraged to utilize IP whitelisting for services that are not meant to be visible to the entire internet. In order to add it to a route do:\n\n    ```sh\n    oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist='192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.1'\n    ```\n\n!!! Caution\n    If the whitelist entry is malformed, OpenShift will discard the whitelist and allow all traffic.\n\n* It is also possible to use annotations to [configure Route Timeouts](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/configuring_routing.html), as described in the upstream documentation.\n\n    A timeout from the LoadBalancer looks like:\n\n    ```html\n    <html><body><h1>504 Gateway Time-out</h1>\n    The server didn't respond in time.\n    </body></html>\n    ```\n\n    Any other kind of Timeout error, will more likely be not related to the LoadBalancers.\n\n    For example, to increase the timeout of route `myroute` to 60s give:\n\n    ```sh\n    oc annotate route myroute --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=60s\n    ```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
