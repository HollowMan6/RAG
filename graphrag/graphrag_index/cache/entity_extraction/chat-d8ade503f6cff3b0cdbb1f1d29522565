More is not always better!\n    If you have very large cases, don't exceed 50 simultaneous (sub)jobs.\n\nAs an example, the \"run settings dialog\" of `glide` offers three options:\n\n* Recommended number of subjobs.\n* Exactly (fill in here) subjobs.\n* Subjobs with no more than (fill in here) ligands each.\n\nAim for such numbers that an average subjob takes 1-24 hours to run. This\nensures that the overhead per subjob remains small while offering efficient\nparallelization, i.e. you get your results quickly and each subjob (as well as\nthe master job) has time to finish.\n\nDon't run subjobs that complete faster than 15 minutes. You can check the\nsubjob duration afterwards with [seff](../faq/how-much-memory-my-job-needs.md)\nand use this info in your following jobs: `seff <slurm jobid>`.\n\nIf time runs out for a subjob, search for \"restart\" in the\n[Schrödinger Knowledge Base](https://support.schrodinger.com/s/)\nfor your module, and/or look again for the options of your driver with\nthe `-h` flag. Most jobs are restartable, so you don't lose completed\nwork or used resources.\n\nIf you choose too many subjobs, Maestro may get confused with the Slurm\nmessages and sorting out the issue can be difficult. Also, running too\nmany subjobs at a time can lead to the [license tokens running out](#availability-of-licenses),\nand the time spent waiting in the queue will be wasted.\n\n## Optimal disk usage\n\nThe Schrödinger HOSTs in Puhti have not been configured to use the\n[local NVMe disk](../../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti/#local-storage),\nwhich is available only on some of the compute nodes. Since most jobs don't\ngain speed advantage from NVMe disk, you'll likely queue less by not asking\nfor it. If your job performs a lot of I/O operations, please contact\n[CSC Service Desk](../contact.md) on how to request fast disk. The only disk available\nfor the jobs is the same where your input files already are. Hence, it does not make\nsense to copy the files to a \"temporary\" location at the start of the job.\n\n## Running the Maestro GUI on Puhti\n\n[The _Desktop_ app in the Puhti web interface](../../computing/webinterface/desktop.md)\ncan be used to run the Maestro GUI on Puhti. The performance may, however, be\nslower than running the GUI locally (recommended). Running the GUI on Puhti over\nSSH using X11 forwarding over SSH is **not recommended** as it performs extremely\npoorly.\n\n## Availability of licenses\n\nThe CSC Maestro license has a fixed amount of tokens that are available for everyone.\nFirst, Maestro uses _module specific_ tokens, of which there are many for each module.\nIf they run out, then more jobs (of that same type) can be run with _general tokens_,\nbut when they run out, no more jobs of that type (or any new jobs which need a\ngeneral token) can be run by anyone. Therefore, this situation should be avoided.\nOnce a job ends, the tokens are released, and are available for everyone.\n\nYou can check the currently available licenses (tokens) with:\n\n```bash\n$SCHRODINGER/utilities/licutil -avail\n```\n\nand currently used licenses (tokens) with:\n\n```bash\n$SCHRODINGER/utilities/licutil -used\n```\n\nNote that some Maestro tools or workflows use multiple modules and hence licenses\nor tokens from multiple modules. Typically, one running instance of a module (a job or\na subjob) requires several tokens. For example, Desmond and Glide jobs take 8 tokens each.\n\nCPU time (billing units) is a different resource and has nothing to do with license tokens.\nWhen you run out of billing units, you or your project manager can\n[apply for more via the My CSC portal](../../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md).\n\n## Fizzled jobs\n\nSometimes the jobs are launched, but don't finish. The state of the job as\nreported by `jobcontrol` (see below) is _fizzled_. This might be due to a\nnumber of reasons, but cleaning up and restarting the jobcontrol service\nmight help. When you don't have any Maestro jobs running (in Puhti), give:\n\n```bash\n$SCHRODINGER/utilities/jserver -cleanall\n$SCHRODINGER/utilities/jserver -shutdown\n```\n\nSometimes the `jserver -cleanall` command will not work because the program thinks\nsome jobs are still running. To force purge these jobs, run:\n\n```bash\n$SCHRODINGER/jobcontrol -delete -force <jobid>\n```\n\nbefore running the above `jserver` commands. `<jobid>` should be replaced by the\nID of your stranded job, for example `puhti-login\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
