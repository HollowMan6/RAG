The available operations:\n\n| Function |\n| :--- |\n| _Create_ a new bucket |\n| _Upload_ an object (max. 5GB) |\n| _View_ objects and buckets |\n| _Download_ an object |\n| _Remove_ objects and buckets |\n| Make buckets _public_ or _private_ |\n\n## Create a bucket\n\n1\\. Go to [pouta.csc.fi](https://pouta.csc.fi/) and login\n\n2\\. In the menu on the left, navigate to **Project | Object Store | Containers**  \n(A container corresponds to a bucket)\n\n![\"Creating a container\"](img/allas_screenshot_create_container.png)  \n**Figure** Creating a container\n\n3\\. Press the **+Container** button and name the bucket (see the [checklist for naming a bucket](../introduction.md#naming-buckets)). If you choose to make the bucket _Public_, the contents of the bucket can be [viewed via the internet](#view-objects-via-the-internet).\n\n## Upload an object\n\nThe data upload function of this interface works only for files smaller than 5 GB.\n\n1\\. Choose the desired bucket and press the **upload symbol** on the right.\n\n![\"Upload object\"](img/Allas_screenshot_upload.png)  \n**Figure** Uploading an object\n\n2\\. Choose the object on your computer and name it. **Note:** Do <u>not</u> use non-ASCII characters (&auml;, &ouml; etc.). \n\n3\\. Upload the object. It will appear in your container. You can also create pseudo folders for the objects with the **+Folder** button next to the upload symbol, e.g. to organize the objects into folders.\n\n## View objects via the internet\n\nIf the bucket containing the objects is set to _public_, the objects can be viewed via the internet by anyone who knows the URL. This setting can be changed in [pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/containers](https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/containers/) by choosing the container and selecting the **Public Access** setting:\n\n![\"Making object public or private\"](img/Allas_screenshot_public.png)\n**Figure** Making an object public or private\n\nFor example, the public object called _my_fish_ in the container _my_fishbucket_ can be viewed with the URL _a3s.fi/my_fishbucket/my_fish_.\nNote that in cases, where a large object is stored to Allas as segments, you must set to _public_ also the segments containing bucket ( e.g. _my_fichbucket_segments_ ).\n\n## Download an object\n\nDownload an object by clicking the **Download** button on the right side of the object's name.\n\n## Remove objects and buckets\n\nObjects can be removed by expanding the dropdown menu on the right next to the _Download_ button and choosing **Delete**.\n\nBuckets can be removed only when they are empty. Hence, all objects in a bucket must be removed or moved elsewhere before the bucket can be deleted. Remove a bucket by clicking the **trashcan symbol** next to the bucket's name. \n\n![\"Removing object or container\"](img/Allas_screenshot_delete.png)\n**Figure** Removing an object or a bucket\n\nAlternatively, and especially if you want to remove several objects at once, you can choose the objects by selecting the small boxes on the left side of the object names and choosing the **trashcan symbol** on the red background in the upper right corner.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK HORIZON DASHBOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A user-friendly web client for managing resources in OpenStack, including functionalities for object storage like creating buckets, uploading objects, and setting access permissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage service used in conjunction with the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard for managing buckets and objects over the web interface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUTA.CSC.FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The web portal for accessing and managing resources, including the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard for object storage)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK HORIZON DASHBOARD<|>ALLAS<|>The OpenStack Horizon Dashboard provides instructions for using Allas with its web interface<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>POUTA.CSC.FI<|>Allas is accessed and managed through the pouta.csc.fi web portal<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
