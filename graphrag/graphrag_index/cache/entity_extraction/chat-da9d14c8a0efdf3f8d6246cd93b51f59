The repository also contains some useful\nscripts for submitting jobs.\n\n\n## Simulated test runs\n\nAs quantum resources can be scarce, it is recommended that you prepare the codes and algorithms you intend to run on Helmi in advance. To help with this process, [`qiskit-on-iqm` provides a fake noise model backend](https://iqm-finland.github.io/qiskit-on-iqm/user_guide.html#noisy-simulation-of-quantum-circuit-execution). You can run the fake noise model backend locally on your laptop for simulation and testing.\n\nA set of Qiskit and Cirq examples and scripts for guidance in using the LUMI-Helmi partition are also available. [You can find these here](https://github.com/FiQCI/helmi-examples).\n\n## Job Metadata\n\nAdditional metadata about your job can be queried directly with Qiskit. For example:\n\n```python\n\nprovider = IQMProvider(HELMI_CORTEX_URL)\nbackend = provider.get_backend()\n\n#Retrieving backend information\nprint(f'Native operations: {backend.operation_names}')\nprint(f'Number of qubits: {backend.num_qubits}')\nprint(f'Coupling map: {backend.coupling_map}')\n\njob = execute(circuit, backend, shots=shots)\nresult = job.result()\nexp_result = result._get_experiment(circuit)\n\nprint(\"Job ID: \", job.job_id())  # Retrieving the submitted job id\nprint(result.request.circuits)  # Retrieving the circuit request sent\nprint(\"Calibration Set ID: \", exp_result.calibration_set_id)  # Retrieving the current calibration set id.\nprint(result.request.qubit_mapping)  # Retrieving the qubit mapping\nprint(result.request.shots)  # Retrieving the number of requested shots.\n\n#retrieve a job using the job_id from a previous session\n#old_job = backend.retrieve_job(job_id)\n```\n!!! info \"Save your Job ID!\"\n    Note that there is currently no method to list previous Job ID's therefore it is recommended to always print your Job ID after job submission and save it somewhere!\n    The same applies for the calibration set id.\n\n\n## Figures of Merit\n\nThe figures of merit (or quality metrics set) may be necessary for publishing work produced on Helmi. It also gives an idea as to the current status of Helmi. In `helmi-examples` there is a helper script to get the calibration data including the figures of merit. The script can be found [here](https://github.com/FiQCI/helmi-examples/blob/main/scripts/get_calibration_data.py). This file can be added to your own python scripts and will return data in json format. Note that querying the latest calibration data may give an incomplete or outdated set of figures. Therefore calibration set IDs should be saved along with Job IDs.\n\nHere is a brief description of the figures which are given when querying:\n\n| Figure                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |     |     |\n| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |\n| T1 Time (s)                     | The T1 time is called the longitudinal relaxation rate and describes how quickly the excited state of the qubit returns to its ground state.                                          |     |     |\n| T2 Time (s)                     | The T2 time is called the transverse relaxation rate and describes loss of coherence of a superposition state.                                                                        |     |     |\n| T2 Echo Time (s)                | The T2 echo time describes the loss of coherence of the superposition state of the qubit.
