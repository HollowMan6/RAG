Prerequisites\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 4\npermalink: /hands-on/linux_prerequisites/basic-file-editing.html\n---\n\n# Basic file editing\n\n> ‚ÄºÔ∏è To begin, make sure you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) that is a member of a project which [has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\n> ‚òùüèª You should also have already [logged in to Puhti with SSH](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/ssh-puhti.html).\n\n> ‚òùüèª Note: For graphical output to work you need to log in with `ssh -X cscusername@puhti.csc.fi`. On Windows/macOS you also need to have an X server installed and running. [See details in the previous tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/ssh-puhti.html#remote-graphics). Another option is to use the Puhti web interface.\n\nIn the [previous tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/linux_prerequisites/basic-linux-commands.html) we downloaded a file called `my-first-file.txt`, made a copy of it named `YourName-first-file.txt`, and now we practice how to edit it!\n\nüí¨ These exercises are done with the `nano` editor, but you can use your favorite editor too.\n\nüí° Here's a [nano cheat sheet](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html)\n\n## Processing text files\n\n1. Open the file with `nano`:\n\n```bash\nnano YourName-first-file.txt      # replace YourName\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Edit the file. Type something there!\n3. Exit `nano` with `Ctrl+X`, type `Y` to confirm saving and press enter to accept the filename.\n4. Check that the modifications are actually there:\n\n```bash\nless YourName-first-file.txt      # replace YourName\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Exit the preview with `q`.\n\n## Processing images and pdf files\n\n‚òùüèª Note! In case you are using the Puhti web interface, you need to open the files below from the file browser.\n\n1. Download an image and a pdf:\n\n```bash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csc-training/csc-env-eff/master/_slides/img/terminal_icon.png\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csc-training/csc-env-eff/master/_slides/img/schrodingerscat.pdf\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Open the image with `eog` or using the file browser of the Puhti web interface.\n\n```bash\neog terminal_icon.png\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Close the preview window.\n4. Open the pdf with `evince` or using the file browser of the Puhti web interface.\n\n```bash\nevince schrodingerscat.pdf\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Close the preview window with your mouse or by pressing `Ctrl+C` when the Terminal window is selected.\n\n## Create text files\n\n1. You can also create files with `nano`. Try simply:\n\n```bash\nnano YourName-markdown-file.md\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. In the text file, write something (*e.g.* instructions for others how to replicate your file creation process), then save and close.\n    - May I interest you with the [basic Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)?\n3. Use `pwd` and copy the path of your current working directory\n4. Copy the text file to your personal computer for example with `scp`\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Note: The following has to be typed in your personal computer's terminal (not Puhti):\n\n```bash\nscp cscusername@puhti.csc.fi:/path/to/your/filename.md /path/to/local/folder\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Look for the file on your personal computer and check that the contents match.\n\n## More information\n\nüí° You can read more about `scp` and moving files from [Docs CSC: Copying files using scp](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/scp/)\n\nüí¨ One way to display `html` files on Puhti is to go through the Allas object storage service. After configuring Allas there's `a-commands` which enable publishing files on the internet. This is instructed in the [Allas tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/allas/tutorial_allas-file-transfer.html).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides user accounts, project memberships, and access to the Puhti service for computational resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is a computational service provided by CSC that users can access for various computing needs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NANO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nano is a text editor used for editing files in a Linux environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH, Secure Shell, is a protocol used to securely log into remote machines, such as Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERMINAL_ICON.PNG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An image file used in the tutorial for demonstrating file downloading and viewing on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHRODINGERSCAT.PDF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A PDF file used in the tutorial for demonstrating file downloading and viewing on Puhti)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is CSC's object storage service that can be used for storing and sharing files, including publishing them on the internet)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>CSC provides access to the Puhti service for computational resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>PUHTI<|>SSH is used to log into Puhti for accessing its computational services<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANO<|>PUHTI<|>Nano is recommended as a text editor for use within the Puhti computing environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>PUHTI<|>Allas is used alongside Puhti for storing and sharing files, including for web publishing<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
