Prerequisites\ngrand_parent: Part 1\nnav_order: 3\npermalink: /hands-on/linux_prerequisites/basic-linux-commands.html\n---\n\n# Basic Linux commands\n\n> ‼️ To begin make sure you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) that is a member of a project which [has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).\n\n> ☝🏻 You should also have already [logged in to Puhti with SSH](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/ssh-puhti.html) or via the Puhti web interface (and opened a login node shell).\n\n## Navigating folders\n\n1. Now that you have logged in to Puhti, check which folder you are in by typing `pwd` and hitting `Enter`:\n\n```bash\npwd\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Check if there are any files:\n\n```bash\nls\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Make a directory and see if it appears:\n\n```bash\nmkdir YourNameTestFolder    # replace YourName\nls\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. Go to that folder.\n\n```bash\ncd YourNameTestFolder       # replace YourName\n```\n\n💡 Note: if you just type `cd` and the first letter of the folder name, then hit `tab` key, the terminal completes the name. Handy!\n\n## Exploring files\n\n1. Download a file into this new folder. Use the command `wget` for downloading from a URL:\n\n```bash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csc-training/csc-env-eff/master/part-1/prerequisites/my-first-file.txt\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 1\"}\n2. Check what kind of file you got and what size it is using the `ls` command with some extra options:\n\n```bash\nls -lth         # options are l for long format, t for sorting by time and h for convenient size units. Anything that starts with a hashtag is a comment and is not executed\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 2\"}\n3. Use the `less` command to check out what the file looks like:\n\n```bash\nless my-first-file.txt\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 3\"}\n4. To exit the `less` preview of the file, hit `q`.\n\n💡 Tip: Instead of `less` you can use `cat` which prints the content of the file(s) straight into the command line. For long texts `less` is recommended.\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 4\"}\n5. Make a copy of this file:\n\n```bash\ncp my-first-file.txt YourName-first-file.txt    # replace YourName\nls -lth\nless YourName-first-file.txt                    # replace YourName\n```\n\n{:style=\"counter-reset:step-counter 5\"}\n6. Remove the file we originally downloaded (leave your own copy).\n\n```bash\nrm my-first-file.txt\nls\n```\n\n💡 Tip: If you don't want to have duplicate files you can use `mv` to 'move/rename' the file. Syntax is the same: `mv /path/to/source/oldname /path/to/destination/newname`.\n\n## More information\n\n- Learn [how to edit that file](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/linux_prerequisites/basic-file-editing.html) in the next tutorial!\n\n💡 For more information of a given command line `command`: type `man command` or `command --help` where `command` is replaced with the one that you need help with.\n\n💡 Tip: If you remember *a part of a command* that you have used recently you can search for it with the command `history | grep string`. This will show all your used commands that have included the string `string` (replace this with the pattern you are searching for).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
