At this time there is no ansible module for Tofu.\n\n\n<center>![Heat webUI](../../img/heat-web-ui.png)\n*Heat web UI*\n</center>\n\n!!! warning \"Tools evolve\"\n\n    Keep in mind that the situations for these (and most) tools evolve over time, support may get better or dropped altogether, features and bugs may be fixed, ...\n\n### Configuration management tools\n\nEvery application you build has some dependencies in the form of software libraries and their specific versions.\nIn order for your application to work, these dependencies should be explicitly defined and installed automatically. A configuration management tool like **Ansible** or **Puppet** is the best way to achieve this. Using a configuration management tool to define and install dependencies automatically makes the deployments more reproducible and predictable. In the Ansible example below, a task called \"Install dependencies\" will install few tools:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install dependencies\n  become: yes\n  package:\n   name:\n     - gzip\n     - git\n     - curl\n   state: present\n```\n\nWhen all dependencies are declared, Ansible will make sure that they are installed in the deployment environment before the actual application is\ndeployed. You should never install any dependencies\nmanually, instead automate their installation. This helps reproducibility (all systems will be installed in the same way) and the system will be self-documented (it will be clear what needs to be installed). It is also possible to specify versions of software to make the installation much more stable.\n\nThese principles also apply to configuration. When possible, you should use upstream modules to handle the configuration of the software installed. Modules often isolate you from platform and version differences, i.e. you will write the same configuration definition for different versions of the software and different flavors of the operating systems and the module will translate that for you.\n\nConfiguration management tools integrate very well with Pouta clouds. As they are able to read and use specific deployment values of the VMs, like IP addresses, host names, etc...  This means that these variables do not need to be hardwired into the system and will always be kept up to date. For example, we have a load balancer and few worker nodes, the load balancer needs to have a list of worker node IPs. A configuration management tool will be able to generate automatically the load balancer configuration using the information it gets from OpenStack's API. The final product is hands-off installation and upgrade process, where the configuration management does all the work and no manual work is necessary.\n\n## Research alternatives before you develop and deploy\n\nBefore you start to develop and deploy a new service, it is advisable to explore if existing services and software already cover your use case. You should try to avoid falling into the \"[not invented here syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)\", where internally developed services and products are unfairly favored. It changes from case to case, as sometimes the project needs cannot be covered by existing solutions. CSC provides some service solutions that you should be aware of:\n\n### Noppe\n\nIf you need Jupyter or RStudio notebook, CSC provides a [noppe service](../noppe/index.md). It is a mature service provided by a dedicated team of professionals.\n\n### Rahti\n\nIf you need to deploy Docker containers on a cluster like Kubernetes, CSS provides [Rahti](../rahti/index.md). Rahti is a OpenShift okd developed by RedHat.\n\n### Pukki\n\nIf you need a database, you should take a look to [Pukki](../dbaas/what-is-dbaas.md), CSC's Database as a Service offering (**currently in a closed beta**).\n\n\n!!! info \"contact us\"\n\n    If any of these services interest you, but they do not cover 100% your needs, please contact us at <servicedesk@csc.fi> and we will study your case.\n\n## Summary\n\nPouta offers few useful tools and resources that will make it easier to develop more reliable applications. Cloud deployments work very well when the application follow the idea of disposable microservices that are prepared to scale up and down transparently and are designed to respond well to unexpected failures. Pouta gives the flexibility of easily deploying isolated development environments. In addition, the API gives all the power of automation to you, and thanks to Devops tools it is simple to use that power. And of course never forget to backup your data.\n\n  [practices]: https://12factor.net/\n  [code repositories]: https://github.com/CSCfi\n  [code repository]: http://https://github.com/CSCfi/etherpad-deployment-demo\n  [Etherpad code example]: https://github.com/CSCfi/etherpad-deployment-demo\n  [OpenStack Heat resources]: https://docs.openstack.org/heat/stein/template_guide/openstack.html\n  [Ansible playbooks]: https://github.com/CSCfi/spark-openstack\n  [Travis CI]: https://travis-ci.org\n  [Circle CI]: https://circleci.com/\n  [Github actions]: https://github.com/features/actions\n  [cPouta]: https://pouta.csc.fi\n  [ePouta]: http://epouta.csc.fi\n  [Allas]: ../../data/Allas/index.md\n  [Cinder]: persistent-volumes.md\n  [ansible-openstack-example]: https://github.com/cscfi/ansible-openstack-example\n  [heat-openstack-example]: https://github.com/cscfi/heat-openstack-example\n  [terraform-openstack-example]: https://github.com/cscfi/terraform-openstack-example\n  [flavor]: vm-flavors-and-billing.md\n  [OpenStack provider]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
