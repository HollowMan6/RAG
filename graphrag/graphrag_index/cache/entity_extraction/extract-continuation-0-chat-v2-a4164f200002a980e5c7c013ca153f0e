Creating a SquashFS image from your\n  dataset, possibly composed of thousands of files, reduces it to a single file\n  from the point of view of Lustre. However, mounting the image to your Singularity\n  execution makes it appear as an ordinary directory inside the container.\n* If you have to use Lustre for IO-heavy tasks, make sure to leverage [file striping]\n\nWhether or not you are running HTC workflows, another important aspect affecting\nIO-efficiency is how your application is installed.\n[CSC has deprecated the direct usage of Conda environments] due to the huge amount\nof files they bring about. A large fraction of these files are read each time a\nConda application is run, causing excessive load on Lustre and system-wide slowdowns.\n**Conda environments and other applications reading thousands of files at start-up\nshould thus be containerized**. To make this easy, the [container wrapper tool Tykky]\nhas been made available.\n\nFurther details on [how to work efficiently with Lustre are documented here].\nPlease also consider the flowchart below as a guideline for selecting the most\nappropriate technologies for your IO-intensive workflows.\n\n```mermaid\n%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '0.6rem'}}}%%\ngraph TD\n    A(Is your application containerized?) -->|Yes| B(<a href='/computing/containers/run-existing/#mounting-datasets-with-squashfs'>Mount your dataset with SquashFS</a>)\n    A -->|No| C(Are you running a Conda/pip environment?)\n    C -->|Yes| D(<a href='/computing/containers/tykky/'>Containerize it with Tykky</a>)\n    D --> B\n    C -->|No| E(Are you running on Puhti or Mahti?)\n    E -->|Mahti| F(CPU or GPU job?)\n    F -->|CPU| G(<a href='/computing/disk/#compute-nodes-without-local-ssd-nvme-disks'>Use ramdisk</a>)\n    F -->|GPU| H(<a href='/computing/disk/#compute-nodes-with-local-ssd-nvme-disks'>Use fast local NVMe disk</a>)\n    E -->|Puhti| H\n    B -->|No| E\n    B -->|Yes| I(Done)\n    I -.-> E\n    G -->|No, I have to use Lustre| J(<a href='/computing/lustre/#file-striping-and-alignment'>Use file striping</a>)\n    H -->|No, I have to use Lustre| J\n```\n\n!!!warning \"Note\"\n    Please do not reserve GPU nodes just to utilize the node's NVMe disk.
