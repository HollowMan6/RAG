language](https://julialang.org) is a high-performance, dynamic programming language.\nJulia is excellent for scientific computing because it can compile efficient native code using LLVM and includes mathematical functions, parallel computing capabilities, and a package manager in the standard library.\nFurthermore, Julia's syntax is intuitive and easy to learn, the multiple-dispatch paradigm allows writing composable code, increasing the ability to reuse existing code, and environments enable executing code in a reproducible way.\n\n[TOC]\n\n\n## License\nJulia language is licensed under free and open source [MIT license](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n\n\n## Available\nJulia language is available on Puhti, Mahti, and LUMI from the command line using the [module system](../computing/modules.md).\nIt is also available on the web interface via [Jupyter](../computing/webinterface/julia-on-jupyter.md) and [VSCode](../computing/webinterface/vscode.md#julia-language).\n\nIf you find issues in using Julia on the cluster, you should [contact the servicedesk](../support/contact.md).\n\n\n## Usage\n### Using the Julia module\nJulia language is available from the `julia` module.\n\n=== \"Puhti and Mahti\"\n\n    On Puhti and Mahti, we can load the module as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    module load julia\n    ```\n\n=== \"LUMI\"\n\n    On LUMI, we must add the module files under CSC's local directory to the module path before loading the module.\n\n    ```bash\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n    module load julia\n    ```\n\nAfter loading the Julia module, we can use Julia with the `julia` command.\nWithout arguments, it starts an interactive Julia REPL.\n\n```bash\njulia\n```\n\nFor available command line options, we can run `julia --help` or read the manual `man julia`.\nFor questions about the features of Julia language, we refer we recommend the official [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org) and the [discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) channel.\n\n\n### Using the package manager\nThe standard method for installing Julia packages is to use the package manager, `Pkg`, from the standard library.\nIn Julia, we can import it as follows:\n\n```julia\nimport Pkg\n```\n\nThe common functions we use are `Pkg.add` to add packages, `Pkg.activate` to activate environments, and `Pkg.instantiate` to install all packages defined in the active environment.\nThe [Pkg documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/) provides more information on how to use Julia's package manager.\n\n\n### Placing the Julia depot directory\nThe first directory on the Julia depot path controls where Julia stores installed packages, compiled files, log files, and other depots.\nIt is `$HOME/.julia` by default.\nThe home directory has a relatively small quota on Puhti, Mahti, and LUMI.\nIf you install large packages, we recommend placing the depot directory under Projappl to avoid running out of quota.\nWe can change the depot directory by prepending a new directory to `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` environment variable.\n\nFor example, we can use the following by replacing the `<project>` with a CSC project.\n\n```bash\nexport JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=\"/projappl/<project>/$USER/.julia:$JULIA_DEPOT_PATH\"\n```\n\nAfterward, you can safely remove the default depot directory using `rm -r $HOME/.julia`.\nFor more information, you can read more about the [depot path documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/constants/#Base.DEPOT_PATH).\n\n\n### Multi-threading\nJulia provides the `Threads` library for multi-threading.\nIt is included in the base library and imported by default in a Julia session.\nWe can start Julia with multiple threads by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or starting Julia with the `--threads` option which overrides the value in the environment variable.\nIf Julia module is loaded within a Slurm job and the environment variable is not set, it is set to the amount of requested CPU cores (`--cpus-per-task`).\nThe default thread count is one.\nWe recommend reading the [multi-threading](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/) section in Julia's manual for more details.\n\n\n### Multi-processing and distributed computing\n#### Distributed and ClusterManagers.jl\nFor multiprocessing and distributed computing, Julia provides the `Distributed` standard library.\nWe use it for multi-processing on the local node.\nWe can extend `Distributed` by installing the `ClusterManagers.jl` package, which allows us to add workers' processes to multiple nodes via Slurm using `SlurmManager`.\nWe recommend reading the [multi-processing and distributed computing](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/distributed-computing/) section in Julia manual for more details.\n\n\n#### MPI.jl\nWe can use MPI for distributed computing, especially over multiple nodes, in Julia on Puhti, Mahti, and LUMI using the `MPI.jl` package.\nWe can install it using the package manager as follows:\n\n```julia\nimport Pkg\nPkg.add(\"MPI\")\n```\n\nWe can load the `julia-mpi` module which sets global preferences to the environment such that MPI.jl uses to use the system MPI installation and the correct command to start MPI processes.\n\n```bash\nmodule load julia-mpi\n```\n\nFor more information, we\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model":
