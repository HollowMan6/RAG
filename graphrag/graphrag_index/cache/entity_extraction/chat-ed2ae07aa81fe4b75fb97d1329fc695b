Currently, there are two major providers of the\n`singularity` runtime, namely [Singularity CE][singularityce] and\n[Apptainer][apptainer], with the latter being a fork of the former. For most\ncases, these should be fully compatible. LUMI provides the `singularity` runtime\nincluded in the HPE Cray Operating System (a SUSE Linux based OS) running on\nLUMI - no modules need to be loaded to use `singularity` on LUMI. You can\nalways check the version of singularity using the command `singularity\n--version`.\n\nSee the [Apptainer/Singularity containers install page][containers-install] for\ndetails about creating LUMI compatible software containers.\n\n## The basics of running a container on LUMI\n\nApplications in a container may be run by combining Slurm commands with\nSingularity commands, e.g., to get the version of Ubuntu running in a container\nstored as \"ubuntu_22.04.sif\", we may use `srun` to execute the `singularity`\ncontainer\n\n```bash\n$ srun --partition=<partition> --account=<account> singularity exec ubuntu_21.04.sif cat /etc/os-release\n```\n\nwhich prints something along the lines of\n\n```text\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS\"\nNAME=\"Ubuntu\"\nVERSION_ID=\"22.04\"\nVERSION=\"22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)\"\nVERSION_CODENAME=jammy\nID=ubuntu\nID_LIKE=debian\nHOME_URL=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/\"\nSUPPORT_URL=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/\"\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/\"\nPRIVACY_POLICY_URL=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy\"\nUBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy\n```\n\n### Binding network file systems in the container\n\nBy default, the [network file system partitions][data-storage-options], such as\n`/scratch` or `/project` are not accessible from the within the container. To\nmake them available, they need to be explicitly bound by passing the\n`-B/--bind` command line option to `singularity exec/run`. For instance\n\n```bash\n$ srun --partition=<partition> --account=<project_name> singularity exec -B /scratch/<project_name> ubuntu_21.04.sif ls /scratch/<account>\n```\n\n!!! warning\n    Since project folder paths like `/scratch/<project_name>` and\n    `/project/<project_name>` are symlinks on LUMI, you must bind these full\n    paths to make them available in the container. Simply binding `/scratch` or\n    `/project` will not work.\n\n## Running containerized MPI applications\n\nRunning MPI applications in a container requires that you either bind the host\nMPI (the MPI stack provided as part of the software stack available on the\ncompute node) or install a LUMI compatible MPI stack in the container.\n\n!!! warning\n    For MPI-enabled containers, the application inside the container must be\n    dynamically linked to an MPI version that is [ABI-compatible][mpich-abi]\n    with the host MPI.\n\n### Using the host MPI\n\nTo properly make use of LUMI's high-speed network, it is necessary to\nmount a few host system directories inside the container and set\n`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so that the necessary dynamic libraries are available at run\ntime. This way, the host's MPI stack replaces the MPI installed in the container image.\n\nAll the necessary components are available in a module that can be installed\nby the user via [EasyBuild][easybuild-install]\n\n```bash\n$ module load LUMI partition/<lumi-partition> EasyBuild-user\n$ eb singularity-bindings-system-cpeGNU-<toolchain-version>.eb -r\n```\n\nRunning e.g. the [OSU point-to-point bandwidth test\ncontainer](../../software/containers/singularity.md#building-containers-on-local-hardware)\ncan then be done using\n\n```bash\n$ module load singularity-bindings\n$ srun --partition=<partition> --account=<account> --nodes=2 singularity run mpi_osu.sif\n```\n\nwhich gives the bandwidth measured for different message sizes, i.e., something\nalong the lines of\n\n```text\n# OSU MPI Bandwidth Test v5.3.2\n# Size      Bandwidth (MB/s)\n1                       3.00\n2                       6.01\n4                      12.26\n8                      24.53\n16                     49.83\n32                     97.97\n64                    192.37\n128                   379.80\n256                   716.64\n512                  1386.52\n1024                 2615.18\n2048                 4605.69\n4096                 6897.21\n8192                 9447.54\n16384               10694.19\n32768               11419.39\n65536               11802.31\n131\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
