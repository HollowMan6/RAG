[Simcenter STAR-CCM+](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/STAR-CCM.html) allows the modeling and analysis of a range of engineering problems involving fluid flow, heat transfer, stress, particulate flow, electromagnetics and related phenomena. Formerly known as STAR-CCM+, the software was first developed by CD-adapco and was acquired by Siemens Digital Industries Software as part of the purchase of CD-adapco in 2016. It is now a part of the Simcenter Portfolio of software tools (Wikipedia).\n\n## License\n\nCSC - IT Center for Science has no own Star-CCM+ licenses available for customer use on CSC's computing platforms.  Instead, user may purchase for her or his own use a *Power-On-Demand* (PoD) license to be used on the servers, for more information, see this [web page](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O000061xpm2SAA/simcenter-starccm-licensing-options-and-setup-installation-and-troubleshooting).\n\n## Available\n\nSeveral versions of Star-CCM+ are available on [Puhti, Mahti and LUMI](../computing/available-systems.md) servers. Use command\n\n```bash\nmodule spider starccm+\n```\n\non the server to check the installed versions. The double precision version will have the `-R8` suffix on the end of the module version number.\n\nOn LUMI, you need to first load the module environment, and then give module spider command\n\n```bash\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule spider starccm+\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThere is a **batch job script** example available on the Puhti and Mahti servers in:\n\n```bash\n/appl/soft/eng/starccm+/parjob_starccm+\n```\n\nOn LUMI, the example batch job file is available here:\n\n```bash\n/pfs/lustrep3/appl/local/csc/soft/eng/starccm+/parjob_starccm_lumi\n```\n\nCopy the file and modify it for your own use. Further instructions are given in the file and the documentations of the platforms.\n\n## Support\n\nIn a problem situation, please [contact CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\n## More information\n\n* [Simcenter STAR-CCM+](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/STAR-CCM.html)\n* [Simcenter STAR-CCM+ Power On Demand licensing](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O000061xpm2SAA/simcenter-starccm-licensing-options-and-setup-installation-and-troubleshooting)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIMCENTER STAR-CCM+<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Simcenter STAR-CCM+ is a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based simulation software developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software, allowing modeling and analysis of engineering problems involving fluid flow, heat transfer, and more)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIEMENS DIGITAL INDUSTRIES SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Siemens Digital Industries Software is the developer of Simcenter STAR-CCM+, a part of the Simcenter Portfolio, and acquired CD-adapco in 2016)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CD-ADAPCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CD-adapco was the original developer of STAR-CCM+, which was acquired by Siemens Digital Industries Software in 2016)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC - IT Center for Science does not have its own Star-CCM+ licenses but provides information on obtaining Power-On-Demand licenses for use on its computing platforms)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is one of the servers where Star-CCM+ is available for use)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is one of the servers where Star-CCM+ is available for use)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>LUMI is one of the servers where Star-CCM+ is available for use and requires loading a specific module environment for access)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMCENTER STAR-CCM+<|>SIEMENS DIGITAL INDUSTRIES SOFTWARE<|>Simcenter STAR-CCM+ was developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software and is part of its Simcenter Portfolio<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIEMENS DIGITAL INDUSTRIES SOFTWARE<|>CD-ADAPCO<|>Siemens Digital Industries Software acquired CD-adapco, the original developer of STAR-CCM+, in 2016<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMCENTER STAR-CCM+<|>CSC - IT CENTER FOR SCIENCE<|>CSC - IT Center for Science provides information on obtaining licenses for Simcenter STAR-CCM+ but does not offer its own licenses<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMCENTER STAR-CCM+<|>PUHTI<|>Star-CCM+ is available on the Puhti server<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMCENTER STAR-CCM+<|>MAHTI<|>Star-CCM+ is available on the Mahti server<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMCENTER STAR-CCM+<|>LUMI<|>Star-CCM+ is available on the LUMI server<|>5)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
