This includes, but it is not limited to: **virtual machines**, **network configuration**, **user accounts**, ...\n\n!!! info \"Security reports\"\n\n    If you have discovered a critical security flaw or believe your machine has been compromised, please contact us immediately at <servicedesk@csc.fi>.\n\nThis list of security guidelines is not meant to cover all the possible cases and scenarios, but to serve as a starting point for keeping everyone secure. \n\n## Network\n\nIt is very important to keep your network configuration as secure as possible, as it is the gate any intruder will use to enter in your system. It is relatively simple to apply some good practises that will give a good extra security layer. Few strategies are advisable. \n\n### Restrictive firewall (white listing)\n\nYour virtual machine instances should be configured so that they allow the minimum required access to run your application. By default, virtual machines have no external access, this means no single port is opened by default to the public Internet. In order to connect to them, or to provide any kind of service, access has to be explicitly added. It is important to only open the ports that need to be opened and only open it for the least amount of IPs possible.\n\nEvery virtual machine running in Pouta comes with two firewalls: the firewall of the virtual machine itself (netfilter/iptables) and Pouta Security groups. We are only going to focus on Pouta security groups, as they are the easiest way to apply a set of complex firewall rules to a set of virtual machines. This is an example of a security group that gives access to port 22/SSH to only 4 subnets:\n\n![Restricted-SSH](../../img/restricted-ssh-security-group.png)\n\nThese 4 subnets could be the 4 public ranges that your organization uses in its office network.\n\nSecurity groups are easy to configure and easy to visualize. This is the view from a virtual machine's instance page:\n\n![Restricted API SSH](../../img/restricted-api-ssh.png)\n\nyou can see that every single opening is shown there. \n\n### Disable unneeded services\n\nDo not run unnecessary services on your VM, even if they are not accessible from the outside. The more services you run, the more attack surface you will have top intruders to exploit. For example, do not deploy your own mail server. If you need to send email from cPouta, use [Pouta's SMTP server](additional-services.md#sending-e-mail-from-cpouta). If this SMTP server does not cover your use case, please contact <servicedesk@csc.fi>.\n\n### Use secure protocols\n\nWherever possible, use encrypted and secure communication protocols to avoid man in the middle attacks, this is when someone get access to your communications and can read the data going through like in a public WIFI. For example: Do not use HTTP, use instead HTTPS. Do not use FTP to transfer files, use instead FTPS, SFTP or S3.\n\n### Use intrusion detection software\n\nTools such as [denyhosts](https://github.com/denyhosts/denyhosts) or [Fail2ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban) will analyse log files and ban IP addresses that are attempting to make brute-force attacks to your application. They are very powerful tools, but they have to be used used with care as they can lead to false positives, i.e. Banning IPs that should not be banned. \n\n## Software\n\nRunning secure software is also very important. It is not a trivial task to develop fully secure software, but there are some simple strategies that will help with the task. \n\n### Only install from reputable sources\n\nBe mindful of the sources for the software you install. Only install software from reputable sources. If possible, use the distribution's package manager (`yum`, `dnf`, `apt`, ...). Packages managers make it easy to install software, keep it updated, and uninstall it. If the desired software it not available in the distribution package manager repository, an official source must be used. Follow the instructions on the official website of the software you need. If more than one source is offered, think about using the one that provides an easier life-cycle (install/update/uninstall/...), like [snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)) or [flatpak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak).\n\n### Automatic software updates\n\nAll operating systems have the ability to apply updates automatically. If you run regular updates, you are less exposed to known security problems. It is common that the fix is available before the security problem is published.\n\nIn Centos 8 and newer, you have `dnf-automatic`:\n\n```yaml\nsudo yum install dnf-automatic -y\nsystemctl enable --now dnf-automatic-install.timer\n```\n\n`yum-cron` for Centos 7:\n\n```yaml\nsudo yum install yum-cron -y\nsudo systemctl enable yum-cron.service\nsudo systemctl start yum-cron.service\n```\n\n`unattended-upgrades` for Ubuntu:\n\n```yml\nsudo apt install unattended-upgrades\n```\n\nEach OS version will have its own way to activate this.\n\n!!! info \"Kernel updates\" \n\n    Some updates, such as kernel upgrades, require rebooting the virtual machines. Please schedule this into your regular maintenance.\n\nIf your use case does not support automatic updates, which is common for highly available setups, please make sure to schedule regular maintenance windows where the software upgrade is scheduled.\n\n* **Subscribe to security announcements for your OS**, if there is a security problem in your operating system, you need to find it out as soon as possible. You can subscribe to an appropriate mailing list, RSS feed,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
