While there are multiple methods available for this task, we recommend utilising the graphical user interface SDA (Sensitive Data Archive) Uploader tool. Installing this simple application may require special permission from your system administration, but it will conveniently enable the tool to establish the secure connection using the SSH keys you've already tested, encrypt the files with [CSC public encryption key for registers](https://admin.sd.csc.fi/publickey/?instance=single%20registry), and upload them. \n\n#### 4.1 Upload with the SDA Uploader tool\n\nWith the SDA Uploader tool, you need to collect all the data to one folder on your computer before transfer.\n\n!!! Note \n    The folder name determines the indentifying information visible in SD Apply. Therefore, it is a good practice to use the journal number or other unique identifier for the folder name. This ensures that the correct data are always sent to the correct applicant, even in additional data transfers.  \n      \n1. Create a folder on your computer and name it with the journal number or other suitable unique identifier. Add all the files belonging to the dataset to that folder.\n2. Download the SDA (Sensitive Data Archive) Uploader tool available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSCfi/sda-uploader/releases), for Linux, Mac and or Windows. You might need permissions from your administrators to install the SDA Uploader tool on your laptop.\n    * Windows (sdagui-python3.11-windows-amd64.zip )\n    * Mac (sdagui-python3.11-macos-amd64.zip)\n    * Linux (sdagui-python3.11-linux-amd64.zip)\n\n\n3. Download the [CSC public encryption key for registers](https://admin.sd.csc.fi/publickey/?instance=single%20registry).\n4. Open the SDA Uploader GUI tool and complete these steps:\n    * Add CSC public key for registers using `Load Recipient Public Key` button.\n    * Select the folder you want to upload with the `Select Directory to Upload` button.\n    * Add your private SSH key (RSA format) with the `Load SSH Key`.\n    * Fill in your username (username@org.fi) to the `SFTP Username` text field.\n    * Fill in the SFTP server: porin.lega.csc.fi:50527 to the `SFTP Server` text field.\n    \n5. Finally, click on upload and encrypt. All the files will be encrypted, uploaded to CSC and assigned to the same identifier in SD Apply. If the tool requests a password for your SSH key, just leave the field empty. The data will become automatically discoverable in SD Apply with the folder name.\n\n[![SDA Uploader tool.](images/apply/SDA_Uploader.png)](images/apply/SDA_Uploader.png)\n\n\n#### 4.2 Advanced options\n\nThis SDA (Sensitive Data Archive) Uploader tool is available on GitHub, via  command line (CLI, option 2 below) options for Linux, Mac and Windows. More information about the tool in the GitHub repository. Alternatively, you can encrypt the data with Crypt4GH (also GUI available, option 3 below) and send the data directly with SFTP on command line. With each option, you need to use CSC public key for encryption.\n\n##### Advanced option 1\n\nWith the SDA CLI tool, you also first create a folder on your computer and name it with the journal number or other unique identifier. Add all of the files belonging to the dataset to that folder. Then you add the following command to the command line (replace example_dataset_123 with the directory name, username@org.fi with your credentials, and X:\\folder\\filename.key (or ~/.ssh/filename for Linux/macOS) with the location of your SSH key):\n\n```\nsdacli example_dataset_123 -host porin.lega.csc.fi -p 50527 -u username@org.fi -i X:\\folder\\filename.key -pub registry.pub\n```\n\n##### Advanced option 2\n\nWith Crypt4GH and SFTP, you first encrypt the data with CSC public key with either Crypt4GH python module or GUI version. Then you open the SFTP connection with the following command (replace username@org.fi with your credentials and X:\\folder\\filename.key (or ~/.ssh/filename for Linux/macOS) with the location of your private SSH key):\n\n```\nsftp -i X:\\folder\\filename.key -P 50527 username@org.fi@porin.lega.csc.fi\n```\n\nThen create a directory for the dataset you are going to transfer:\n\n```\nmkdir example_dataset_123\ncd example_dataset_123\n```\n\nThen you put all of the files belonging to that dataset to the folder:\n\n```\nput example_dataset_123_file-1\nput example_dataset_123_file-2\nput example_dataset_123_file-3\nexit\n```\n\nAfter a successful upload, the dataset is visible in SD Apply. With the direct SFTP transfer, you can wait a moment after putting the first file to the folder for the directory to become visible in SD Apply, so the system doesn't create multiple entries for single directory. This might happen, if the files are sent too quickly one after the other.
