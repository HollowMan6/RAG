Option `-w` enables us to write to the sandbox:\n\n```text\nsudo apptainer shell -w sd_sandbox_1\n```\n\nNow we are inside the Apptainer sandbox, and we can start installing the software we need.\nWe have already Conda available that will provide a handy way to install many software tools.\nFor example, following commands install _bamtools_ into Conda environment called _biotools_. \n\n```text\nconda init bash\nbash\nconda create -n biotools\nconda activate biotools\nconda install bamtools\n```\n\nWe could also use normal installation procedures instead of Conda. For example instead of `conda install vcftools`\nyou could do vcftools installation with commands:\n\n```text\ncd /opt/tools\ngit clone https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools\ncd vcftools/\nautoreconf -i\n./configure --prefix=/opt/tools\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\nNew version of samtools could be installed with command:\n\n```text\napt install samtools\n```\n\nPip can be used to add Python modules:\n\n```text\npip install pyhdfe\n```\n\nWhen you are ready with the software installations you can exit the sandbox with command:\n\n```text\nexit\n```\n\nNote: If you have launched a bash session for Conda installations, you will need to give two exit commands\n\n### 3.3 Creating an Apptainer image file\n\nNow we are back in the base virtual machine. Next we convert the sandbox into an Apptainer image file with command:\n\n```text\nsudo apptainer build sd_tools_1.sif sd_sandbox_1\n```\n\nAfter this, file listing (`ls -lh`) shows that the current directory has a sandbox directory and an Apptainer image file\n\n```text\ndrwxr-xr-x. 18 root   root   4.0K Sep 27 12:56 sd_sandbox_1\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 ubuntu ubuntu 419M Sep 27 13:43 sd_tools_1.sif\n```\n\nNote that both the sandbox and Apptainer image file can be used to execute the commands we just installed. For example, we can print out _samtools_ help message with both commands below:\n\n```text\napptainer exec sd_sandbox_1 samtools \napptainer exec sd_tools_1.sif samtools\n```\n\n## 4. Uploading container to Allas/SD Connect\n\nIn order to use the Apptainer container in SD desktop, we need to encrypt it with CSC public key and upload it to Allas. If you want to use the same container in other locations too, for example in Puhti and Mahti, you will need to upload another, non-encrypted version to Allas.\n\nFor the upload process we use the Allas tools we installed in step 2, where we installed Allas tools to directory `$HOME/allas-cli-utils`.\nFirst we add this directory to command path:\n\n```text\nexport PATH=${HOME}/allas-cli-utils:${PATH}\n```\n\nNext we open connection to Allas using the `allas_conf` script. Note that you must define your CSC user account\nwith `-u your-csc-account`. Here we assume that the user account is `kkayttaj`.\n\n```text\nsource ${HOME}/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -u kkayttaj\n```\n\nThe command above asks for the password of the CSC user account and then lists the Allas projects that the user account has available.\nIn this case we select the number that defines project _project_2000123_. After that the Allas connections to the selected project will remain active for the next eight hours.\n\nNow we can access Allas with [a-tools](../Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md) or [rclone](../Allas/using_allas/rclone.md). \nNext we upload the container image we just created to Allas with command:\n\n```text\na-put --sdx sd_tools_1.sif -b 2000123_apptainer_sd -m \"SD Compatible. Contains bamtools, samtools and vcftools.\"\n```\n\nIn the command above option `--sdx` is used to encrypt the container with CSC public key. The encrypted container will be stored to bucket `2000123_apptainer_sd`. Here the bucket name contains the project number (2000123) to ensure uniqueness and _sd_ is used to indicate that this bucket contains SD Desktop compatible data. Option `-m` is used to add a description line to the metadata object that a-put creates.\n\n## 5. Using Apptainer containers in SD Desktop\n\nIn order to use the apptainer container you have created you need first download a copy of the container to the SD Desktop with _Data Gateway_ tool. First login to [SD Desktop](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi) and connect to the Virtual Desktop that you want to use. Open Data Gateway, navigate then\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
