For\nexample, you can tear down your unused virtual machines with automatic\nprovisioning and configuration when you no longer need them. Later when\nyou need them again, you can provision new virtual machines from\nscratch. Your data should always be stored on a volume, and virtual\nmachines should be launched when you need computation done. \n\nAn example how to automate a workflow with Heat, Ansible and Docker to\ndeploy Etherpad containing both clustered database and Load balancing:Â <https://github.com/CSCfi/etherpad-deployment-demo>\n\n### Boot from image\nA good utility in\nPouta is creating your own virtual machine using the *Boot from image\n(creates new  volume)* option. In this case, even if you delete your\nvirtual  machine, the entire file system state is saved on the\npersistent volume in our central storage service. You can boot a new\nvirtual machine from this volume. It will have the same file system\nstate as the previously deleted virtual machine. You can attach this\nvolume to any other virtual machine and access the file system of the\ndeleted virtual machine. It is billed as a normal volume in\nbilling units, which is cheaper than a running virtual\nmachine. Creating virtual machines with this utility and deleting them\nwhen not needed helps save your billing unit\nallocation. One great option is that you can easily delete your\nvirtual machine and start a new one with the same volume\nand a new flavor. This makes it possible to easily scale\nfrom a smaller virtual machine flavor to the biggest virtual machine\nflavors.\n\n!!! info\n\n    This type of scaling is not recommended for the IO,\n    GPU or TB flavors since ephemeral storage data is lost in this\n    process.\n\n### Select a suitable state of your virtual machine\nDepending on your project requirements, you can change the state of your virtual\nmachines:\n\n-   In case you are going on a long vacation and want to save \n    billing units, you can shelveÂ your virtual machines.\n-   If you no longer require your virtual machine, you can delete it\n    after copying all essential data from it to a volume.\n\nYou can transition between different states via the Pouta dashboard,\ncommand line tools or REST APIs, depending on your project setup. The\nmost common states for virtual machines are active, shut down,\nshelved and deleted. There may be occasions when your virtual machine\nenters the _error_ state. Virtual machines in the error state are still\nbilled. In case your virtualÂ machine enters the error state and you are\nunable to recover it, please contactÂ cloud-support@csc.fi.\n\n### Resize your virtual machine\nResizing aÂ virtual machine is a\ngood utility in Pouta, and helps save billing\nunits. Based on your project requirements, you can scale your virtual machine up or\ndown to other flavors. Scaling down your\nvirtual machine when it has less computational workload frees up\ncompute resources and saves billing units. Later on,\ndepending on your computational workload, you can scale up your virtual\nmachines. Please note that you can resize to another flavor from another *family* but it's **highly not recommended!**.\nYou may lose data during this process and CSC is not responsible. We recommend to only resize to the flavors of the\nsame *family*. For example, if you are using a standard\nfamily flavor, you can only resize it to another standard family\nflavor. When the resize is complete, the virtual machine status first\ndisplaysÂ _verify resize_. At this point, you need to confirm again if\nyour virtual machine has been resized as expected. Resizing will have\ndowntime for the virtual machine until the whole resize process has\nbeen completed. Note that resizing is not as elegant as using the _boot\nfrom volume_ option explained above. If you know beforehand that you want change the\nsize of the virtual machines at some point, using boot from\nvolumeÂ when launching the virtual machine gives more\nflexibility.  \nMore information about how to resize an instance [here](../../support/faq/how-to-resize-in-pouta.md)\n\n  [Pouta flavors and billing]: vm-flavors-and-billing.md\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMATED PROVISIONING<|>EVENT<|>Automated provisioning and configuration of virtual machines to save billing units by tearing down unused machines and provisioning new ones as needed\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ETHERPAD DEPLOYMENT DEMO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A demonstration on GitHub by CSCfi showing how to automate a workflow with Heat, Ansible, and Docker for deploying Etherpad with clustered database and load balancing\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOOT FROM IMAGE<|>EVENT<|>A utility in Pouta that allows creating virtual machines from an image, saving the file system state on a persistent volume, which helps in saving billing units\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pouta<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides utilities for managing virtual machines, including booting from image, shelving, deleting, and resizing, to help save billing units\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications.
