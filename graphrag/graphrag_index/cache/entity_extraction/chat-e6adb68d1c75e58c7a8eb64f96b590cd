The purpose of this guide is to give an overview of available options, so it would be easier to decide if CSC has suitable services for your EO research. It helps you find the right data and tools for raster data based EO tasks. This guide focuses on spaceborne platforms. However, many tools and concepts also apply to airborne platforms. If you are interested in the fundamentals of EO, please check the [resources and further reading section](#resources-and-further-reading).\n\n**What are the benefits of using EO data?**\n\n* Possibility to observe wide areas at same time\n* Non-intrusive\n* Same sensor for different parts of the world, easy to compare different areas\n* Time series to see changes during different seasons and years\n* Cost-efficient\n\n!!! default \"Raster data format\"\n\n    Most EO data is available in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-geospatial-raster-data-feb7673f6db0\" aria-label=\"Towards data science guide to raster data\">raster format</a>. The most common file formats are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF\" aria-label=\"GeoTiff data format description\">GeoTiff</a> and <a href=\"http://giswiki.org/wiki/GeoJPEG2000\" aria-label=\"GeoJPEG2000 data format description\">GeoJPEG2000</a>.\n\n## Why should I use CSC computing resources for EO?\n\nFor working with EO data in general, there are three main options:\n\n1) **EO specific services**, which provide both data and ready-to-use processing environments. Usually these give better user experience and efficiency, but the services might be limited in computing power, available tools and options for adding own data or tools. These might have usage fees. Examples are [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/), [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com).\n\n2) **Cloud services** with access to EO data. Practically, the data is often stored in object-storage and can be accessed as independent service. They  provide general computing services, such as virtual machines, to which EO  tools need to be installed by the end-user. These options usually have some fees, mainly for processing and storage. The data download may be free of charge or have a small cost, depending on the amount of data needed. One example is [Amazon Web Services](https://registry.opendata.aws/); also the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com) somewhat fit this category.\n\n3) **Own computing environment** - PC, local cluster, virtual machines. Data needs to be downloaded and all tools must be installed to this system. On the other hand, it gives more freedom to select the tools and set-up. Usually this does not cause any extra costs, but the computing power is usually rather limited.\n\nCSC services do not fit well in this categorization, as they provide some features from all of these. **CSC computing services provide a lot of computing power and storage space, and they are free of charge** for Finnish researchers for academic or educational use. \n\nAt CSC, EO data can be processed and analyzed using a supercomputer, for example [supercomputer Puhti](../../../computing/systems-puhti.md), or a virtual machine in the [cPouta cloud service](../../../cloud/pouta/index.md). Puhti's computing capacity can hardly be compared to any other EO service, in both available processing power and amount of memory. Both Puhti and cPouta have also GPU resources, which are especially useful for large simulations and deep learning use cases. \n\nPuhti has a lot of [pre-installed applications](#what-applications-are-available-on-puhti), so it is a ready-to-use environment. cPouta virtual machines are similar to commercial cloud services, where all set-up and installations are done by the end-user. In general, both services only support Linux software.\n\nAt CSC, [some Finnish EO datasets](#eo-data-at-csc) are available for direct use. In many cases, however, downloading EO data from other services (see [list of EO data download services](#eo-data-download-services)) is a required step of the process. Puhti and cPouta provide local storage of ~1-20 Tb. For more storage space, [Allas object storage](../../../data/Allas/index.md) can be used.\n\nUsing CSC computing services requires basic Linux skills and ability to use some scripting language (for example Python, R, Julia) or command-line tools. In addition, supercomputers and virtual machines require you to understand some specific concepts, so it takes a few hours to get started. The [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/) makes the start considerably easier, providing a desktop environment in the web browser, which enables the use of tools with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and also tools like R Studio and JupyterLab for an easy start with R, Python and Julia.\n\n## What data do I need?\n\nWhen starting a task that requires EO data, there are multiple factors to consider. The decision on what are the most important factors depends heavily on the task and the resources available. The following list summarizes what one needs to consider when defining the data needs:\n\n* Sensor: Different sensors cover different intervals of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum and with that show different properties of the observed areas, they can be active or passive:\n    * Multispectral: multiple intervals around the visible spectrum of the EM are observed\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
