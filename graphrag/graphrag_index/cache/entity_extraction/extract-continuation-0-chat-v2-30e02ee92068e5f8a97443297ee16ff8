We recommend starting one\nserver per job in a job-specific directory for simple cases that fit inside one\nSlurm job.\n\n```bash\n# Specify a location for the server\nexport HQ_SERVER_DIR=\"$PWD/hq-server/$SLURM_JOB_ID\"\n\n# Create a directory for the server\nmkdir -p \"$HQ_SERVER_DIR\"\n```\n\nNow, we start the server in the background and wait for it to start. The server\nkeeps running until we stop it; therefore, we place it in the background so it\ndoes not block the execution of the rest of the script.\n\n```bash\n# Start the server in the background\nhq server start &\n\n# Wait until the server has started\nuntil hq job list &> /dev/null ; do sleep 1 ; done\n```\n\n**Workers**\n\n</--\nNext, we start HyperQueue workers in the background with the number of CPUs and the amount\nof memory defined in the batch script. We access those values using the `SLURM_CPU_PER_TASK`\nand `SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU` environment variables. By starting the workers using the `srun`\ncommand, we create one worker per Slurm task. We also wait for all workers to connect,\nwhich is generally good practice as we can notice issues with the workers early.\n\n```bash\n# Set memory for workers in bytes according to SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU if greater than zero.\n# Otherwise, leave unset to use all the memory of the node.\nif [[ \"${SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU:-0}\" -gt 0 ]]; then\n    # Calculate the total memory reservation and convert it from megabytes to bytes.\n    TOTAL_MEM_BYTES=$((SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK * SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU * 1000000))\n    TOTAL_MEM_OPT=\"--resource mem=sum($TOTAL_MEM_BYTES)\"\nelse\n    TOTAL_MEM_OPT=\"\"\nfi\n\n# Start the workers in the background.\nsrun --overlap --cpu-bind=none --mpi=none hq worker start \\\n    --manager slurm \\\n    --on-server-lost finish-running \\\n    --cpus=\"$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\" \\\n    $TOTAL_MEM_OPT &\n\n# Wait until all workers have started\nhq worker wait \"$SLURM_NTASKS\"\n```\n-->\n\nNext, we start HyperQueue workers in the background with the number of CPUs defined\nin the batch script using the `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` environment variable.
