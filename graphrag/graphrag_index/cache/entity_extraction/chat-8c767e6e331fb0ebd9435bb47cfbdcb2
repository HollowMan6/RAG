efficiency\n\nOften when running many parallel jobs, the problem of input/output (IO) efficiency\narises. If you're doing a lot of IO-operations (reading and writing files) in your\nhigh-throughput workflows, you should pay special attention to *where* these\noperations are performed. CSC supercomputers use [Lustre] as the\nparallel distributed file system. It is designed for efficient parallel IO of\nlarge files, but when dealing with many small files IO quickly becomes a bottleneck.\nImportantly, intensive IO-operations risk degrading the file system performance for\nall users and should thus be moved away from Lustre.\n\nIf you need to read and write thousands of files in your HTC workflow, please use:\n\n* [Fast local NVMe disk] on Puhti and Mahti GPU-nodes\n* [Ramdisk] (`/dev/shm`) on Mahti CPU-nodes\n* If your application\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
