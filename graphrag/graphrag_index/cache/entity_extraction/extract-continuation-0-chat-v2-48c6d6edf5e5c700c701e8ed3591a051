Do one of the following:\n    1. Copy the public key (`ssh-ed25519 ...`) displayed in the PuTTYgen main\n    window to your clipboard. Make sure to scroll down to the bottom of the\n    text box.\n    2. Edit the public key file written by PuTTYgen so that all the file\n    contents are on one row and the key sequence does not contain any\n    spaces. Copy the public key from the file to your clipboard.\n2. Connect to a supercomputer using SSH and open the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\n   file using a text editor. Paste your copied public key to the end of the\n   file and save the file.\n\n!!! note \"Using SSH keys\"\n    See the page on [setting up SSH keys](ssh-keys.md) for general\n    information about using SSH keys for authentication.\n\n### Connecting with SSH keys (PuTTY)\n\nWhen creating a remote connection using PuTTY, select the private key file\nunder `Connection --> SSH --> Auth`. If you want the private key to be\nused each time you connect, save your session to store your choice.\n\n### Authentication agent (PuTTY)\n\nTo avoid having to type your passphrase every time you connect, you can\nuse the [Pageant authentication agent](https://www.putty.be/0.76/htmldoc/Chapter9.html)\nto store your private keys in memory.\n\n## MobaXterm\n\n### Basic usage (MobaXterm)\n\n[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is an SSH client with an embedded X\nserver, which means that it can be used to display graphics. To connect using\nMobaXterm, open the terminal and run:\n\n```bash\n# Replace <username> with the name of your CSC user account and\n# <host> with \"puhti\" or \"mahti\"\n\nssh <username>@<host>.csc.fi\n```\n\n### Graphical connection (MobaXterm)\n\nTo enable displaying graphics over SSH, use the `-X` (X11 forwarding) or `-Y`\n(trusted X11 forwarding) option when creating the connection:\n\n```bash\nssh -X <username>@<host>.csc.fi\n```\n\n### Generating SSH keys (MobaXterm)\n\nYou can generate SSH keys using MobaXterm by running:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519\n```\n\nIf you want your generated keys to persist through MobaXterm restarts,\nset a persistent home directory for MobaXterm in the program settings\n(`Settings --> Configuration --> General`).\n\n!!! note \"Using SSH keys\"\n    See the page on [setting up SSH keys](ssh-keys.md) for general\n    information about using SSH keys for authentication.\n\n### Copying public key to supercomputer (MobaXterm)\n\nThe recommended way to copy a public key to a supercomputer is\n[through the My CSC customer portal](ssh-keys.md#adding-public-key-in-my-csc).\nAlternatively, you can do it in MobaXterm using the `ssh-copy-id`\nutility:\n\n```bash\nssh-copy-id <username>@<host>.csc.fi\n```\n\nYou will be asked for your CSC password (not the passphrase for the SSH key).\nSubsequent logins using the SSH key pair will ask for the passphrase.\n\n### Authentication agent (MobaXterm)\n\nTo avoid having to type your passphrase every time you connect, enable the\nMobAgent authentication agent in the program settings (`Settings -->\nConfiguration --> SSH`).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUTTYGEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software tool used for generating SSH keys for secure remote login)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Secure Shell, a protocol for securely accessing remote computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERCOMPUTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A high-performance computing system used for complex computational tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGEANT AUTHENTICATION AGENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool that stores private keys in memory for PuTTY)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An SSH client with an embedded X server for graphical interface support)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Represents the organization providing the supercomputer access)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUTTYGEN<|>SSH<|>PuTTYgen is used to generate keys for SSH protocol<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>SUPERCOMPUTER<|>SSH protocol is used to connect to a supercomputer<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAGEANT AUTHENTICATION AGENT<|>PUTTYGEN<|>Pageant stores keys generated by PuTTYgen<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>SSH<|>MobaXterm is used as an SSH client for remote connections<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOBAXTERM<|>CSC<|>MobaXterm can be used to connect to CSC's supercomputers<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
