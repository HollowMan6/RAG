|\n| :----------------- | :--------------------------- |\n| mb                 | Create a bucket              |\n| put                | Upload an object             |\n| ls                 | List

            | Get the checksum             |\n| info               | View metadata                |\n| signurl            | Create a temporary URL       |\n| put -P             | Make an object public        |\n| setacl --acl-grant | Manage access rights         |\n\n\nThe table above lists only the most essential `s3cmd` commands. For more\ncomplete list, visit the [s3cmd manual page](https://s3tools.org/usage) or type:\n\n```text\ns3cmd -h\n```\n\nIf you need to make uploaded objects or buckets public you can add the `-P, --acl-public` flag\nto `s3cmd put`. \n\n### restic\n\n`restic` is a slightly different from `rclone` and `s3cmd` and is mainly used\nfor doing backups. \n\n**Set up the restic repository**\n\n```bash\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<MY_ACCESS_KEY>\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<MY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>\n$ restic -r s3:https://lumidata.eu/<bucket> init\n```\n\nAfter this we can run commands like `restic restore` and `restic backup`. the\n`-r` flag with the correct bucket and the KEY environment variables are always\nneeded when running `restic` commands.\n\nFor more information, see the [Restic documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)\n\n## Raw HTTP request \n\nThe LUMI-O object storage can be used by issuing HTTP request.\n\n!!! warning\n\n    We don't recommend using the HTTP API unless there is a specific need. The \n    tools listed above are easier to use. This section only serve as a reference\n    on how to provide the credentials to the HTTP API. \n\n    See [Common error messages](error-messages.md) for explanations on some of\n    the HTTP return codes. \n\nThe example below upload the file `README.md` to the bucket `my-nice-bucket`\nusing `curl`:\n\n```bash\nexport S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<MY_ACCESS_KEY>\nexport S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<MY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>\n\nfile=README.md\nbucket=my-nice-bucket\nresource=\"/${bucket}/${file}\"\ncontentType=\"text/plain\"\ndateValue=`date -R`\nstringToSign=\"PUT\\n\\n${contentType}\\n${dateValue}\\n${resource}\"\ns3Key=$S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID\ns3Secret=$S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\nsignature=`echo -en ${stringToSign} | openssl sha1 -hmac ${s3Secret} -binary | base64`\ncurl -X PUT -T \"${file}\" \\\n     -H \"Host: https://lumidata.eu/\" \\\n     -H \"Date: ${dateValue}\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: ${contentType}\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: AWS ${s3Key}:${signature}\" \\\n      https://lumidata.eu/${bucket}/${file}\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
