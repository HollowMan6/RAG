[**Working with large language models on supercomputers**](ml-llm.md)\n\n## What CSC service to use?\n\nCSC offers several services which might be relevant for machine learning users:\n\n- [Supercomputers, Puhti, Mahti](../../computing/index.md) and\n  [LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/) are multi-user clusters\n  and offer the highest computing performance, including GPU\n  acceleration in a centrally controlled software environment,\n\n- [Pouta](../../cloud/pouta/index.md) offers your own virtual server with full\n  control of the software environment, but restricted computing performance\n  compared to supercomputers, \n\n- [Rahti](../../cloud/rahti/index.md) offers a more automatized container-based\n  cloud environment, useful in particular for deploying web services.\n\n**Our recommendation is to use CSC's supercomputers**, unless you need\na very complicated software environment, or work with sensitive\ndata. In those cases Pouta might be the right choice, and we also\noffer the ePouta variant which is suited for cases with high security\nrequirements.\n\nIf you are developing a service, for example want to deploy a trained\nmodel as a service, then Pouta or Rahti might be most relevant for\nyou.\n\nIf you are unsure about the right service to use, don't hesitate to\n[contact our service desk](../contact.md) and explain your computing\nneeds.\n\n\n## CSC's supercomputers\n\nFor most machine learning needs CSC's supercomputers are the way to\ngo. These are clusters of hundreds (or thousands) of computers, some\nof which offer GPU-acceleration. The supercomputers are multi-user\nsystems, so individual users have limited rights to install software,\nand as with any shared resource one must follow the [usage\npolicy](../../computing/usage-policy.md) so that the service can\nremain usable.\n\nCSC hosts two national supercomputers: Puhti and Mahti, and the\nEuropean LUMI supercomputer. If you are [unsure which supercomputer to\nchoose, read the discussion here](gpu-ml.md#puhti-mahti-or-lumi).\n\nIf you are a new user, please read [how to access Puhti and\nMahti](../../computing/index.md#accessing-puhti-and-mahti), and [how\nto submit computing\njobs](../../computing/running/getting-started.md). If you have opted\nfor LUMI read the [LUMI Get Started\npage](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/).\n\nBoth [Puhti and Mahti have a web\ninterface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md) which can be\naccessed via [www.puhti.csc.fi](https://www.puhti.csc.fi) and\n[www.mahti.csc.fi](https://www.mahti.csc.fi), respectively. Via the\nweb interface, one can easily launch for example a Jupyter Notebook\nsession with TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n\nAlso check the subsections related to [efficient GPU\nutilization](gpu-ml.md), [how to work with big data sets](ml-data.md),\nand [multi-GPU and multi-node jobs](ml-multi.md).\n\n\n## Cloud services\n\n### Pouta\n\nThere are some use cases where the supercomputers are not the right solution,\nand you may need a [virtual server on **Pouta**](../../cloud/pouta/index.md).\nTypical examples include:\n\n- very complex software environment,\n- need for root access,\n- computation involving sensitive data.\n\nWith Pouta you get your own virtual server, where you have root or administrator\naccess. [HPC and GPU flavors are\navailable](../../cloud/pouta/vm-flavors-and-billing.md#hpc-flavors) for heavy\ncomputing needs, however, the computing resources will always be smaller than in\na supercomputer.\n\nFor computation involving highly sensitive data we also offer the ePouta variant\nwhich is suited for cases with high security requirements. With ePouta the\nvirtual server will be integrated into your existing network infrastructure.\n\nSee our [Pouta documentation pages on how to apply for\naccess](../../cloud/pouta/index.md).\n\n\n## Further reading in Docs CSC\n\n* [Python parallel jobs](python-usage-guide.md#python-parallel-jobs)\n* [Dask tutorial](dask-python.md)\n* [High-throughput computing and workflows](../../computing/running/throughput.md)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSC provides computing resources for machine learning, including supercomputers and cloud services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of CSC's national supercomputers offering high computing performance and GPU acceleration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mahti is a national supercomputer hosted by CSC, designed for high computing performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI is a European supercomputer hosted by CSC, offering high computing performance including GPU acceleration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pouta is a cloud service offered by CSC for virtual servers with full control of the software environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti is a container-based cloud service provided by CSC, useful for deploying web services)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>PUHTI<|>Puhti is a supercomputer provided by CSC for machine learning and other computing needs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>MAHTI<|>Mahti is a supercomputer provided by CSC for high-performance computing tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>LUMI<|>LUMI is a European supercomputer hosted by CSC, offering advanced computing resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>POUTA<|>Pouta is a cloud service offered by CSC for users needing virtual servers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSC<|>RAHTI<|>Rahti is provided by CSC for users looking to deploy web services in a cloud environment<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
