If what you need is such a basic Cray optimized Scientific\nPython environment and, possibly, a few extra packages, you may load the\n`cray-python` module and install the few extra packages on the file systems in\na [pip virtual environment][pip-virt-env].\n\n### Use an existing container with a pip virtual environment\n\nIf you have an existing container but need a few extra packages, you may\ninstall such packages on the file systems in [pip virtual\nenvironment][pip-virt-env] and use them with the container. [An example of this\napproach is given in the LUMI PyTorch guide][container-virt-env-example].\n\n### Use the LUMI container wrapper\n\nWe provide the [LUMI container wrapper][tykky] which may be used to solve\nthe \"many small files\" performance problem by wrapping a\n[Conda][conda]/[pip][pip] installation. This is a convenient way to get access\nto a performant Python installation if you only run a single binary/script\nand/or need to intertwine with the host software environment without having to\nexplicitly deal with containers. See [this GitHub\nissues](https://github.com/DeiC-HPC/cotainr/issues/37) for a more detailed\ndiscussion of when this approach may be preferred over using a container\ndirectly.\n\n### Use the CSC software stack\n\n[CSC provides a small additional software stack][csc-software-stack] on LUMI, similar to the\nsoftware stacks provided on the Finnish HPC systems, which contains some Python\npackages.
