So in this case the\ncommand would be:\n\n```bash\na-check -b 2001659-uniref */*.gz\n```\n\nThe `a-check` command compares the item names to be uploaded to the matching\nobjects in Allas. The files or directories that don't have a target object in\nAllas are reported and stored in a file. In this case, if some objects in the\n`a-put` command above would be missing, then `a-check` would list the missing\nfiles and directories in a file `missing_2001659-uniref_63449` (the number at\nthe end is just a random number).\n\nThe file of missing items can then be used with `a-put` option `--input-list`\nto continue the failed upload process:\n\n```bash\na-put -b 2001659-uniref --nc --input-list missing_2001659-uniref_63449\n```\n\nYou should note that `a-check` does not check if the actual contents of the\nobject is correct. It checks only the object names, which might as well\noriginate from some other sources.\n\n## Example 4: Uploading complex directory structures to Allas\n\nSome workflows and software create complex directory structures to store and\nmanage data. You might have directories that have thousands or even millions of\nindividual files. Copying such datasets to Allas takes time and is not always\nstraightforward. The most reasonable way to upload this kind of data depends on\nthe case. This example introduces a few alternatives.\n\nFirst, we open a `screen` session on Puhti and set up an Allas connection just\nlike in the previous example:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi\nscreen\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf -k\n```\n\nSuppose we have a directory structure that contains images from road condition\ncameras from ten locations with an interval of ten minutes from the years\n2014â€“2018. The data is located in the directory `road_cameras` where each\nlocation has its own subdirectory (ten directories). Inside each subdirectory,\nthere is another layer of subdirectories, one for each year (five\nsubdirectories), each containing subdirectories for every day of the year\n(further 365 subdirectories), each containing 144 small image files.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nroad_cameras/site_7/2017/day211/image_654887.jpg\n```\n\nThus, the total number of files in the `road_cameras` directory is\n`10 * 5 * 365 * 144 = 2 628 000`.\n\nIn principle, we could copy all 2.6 million files as separate objects to Allas,\nbut in that case, we should split the data into multiple buckets as one bucket\ncan have at most 0.5 million objects. You could, for example, run a separate\n`rclone` command for each `site_*` directory and put the data from each site to\na site-specific bucket. For example:\n\n```bash\nrclone copyto road_cameras/site_1 allas:2001659_road_cameras_site_1/\n```\n\nThis way, you would end up creating ten buckets each containing 262 800\nobjects. This approach could be the most efficient way for storing and reusing\nthe data if you know that you will need to access individual images randomly.\n\nAs another extreme option, we could use `a-put` and collect all data into a\nsingle archive object. In order to do that, you must add the option\n`--skip-filelist` to the `a-put` command. By default, `a-put` collects detailed\nmetadata of **each** file in an `ameta` file. However, if you have millions of\nfiles, collecting this information takes a long time. If you need to know the\nfile names, you can use the `--simple-fileslist` option to collect the names â€“\nbut **no** other information â€“ of the files in the metadata file. This already\nspeeds up the preprocessing significantly. However, as in this case the naming\nhas been systematic, storing the file names to the metadata files can be just\nignored altogether (`--skip-filelist`), which is the fastest option.\n\n```bash\na-put --skip-filelist road_cameras/\n```\n\nThis approach would store all 2,6 million files as a single object.\n\nIn practice, however, the optimal way of storing the data is often something\nbetween these two extremes. As a compromise, you could apply packing at a\nhigher level in the hierarchy. For example:\n\n```bash\na-put --skip-filelist road_cameras/site_*\n```\n\nThis would produce ten objects, each containing all information from a single\ncamera site. Alternatively, you could do the archiving so that data from each\nyear from each camera is collected as a single object:\n\n```bash\na-put --skip-filelist road_cameras/site_*/20*\n```\n\nThis option would store the data as 50 objects. Day-based objects for each\ncamera might be the most practical option for using the data later on, but as a\ndownside, preprocessing the data into `10 * 5 * 365 = 18250` objects probably\ntakes quite a long time.\n\nCopying millions of files to Allas takes a long time regardless of the method.\nIf we have started the `a-put` command inside a `screen` session, we can detach\nfrom the virtual session by pressing `Ctrl-A D`, log out from Puhti and leave\nthe upload process running for days.\n\nOnce the `a\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is CSC's object storage service used for storing and managing data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-CHECK<|>EVENT<|>A command used to compare item names to be uploaded with matching objects in Allas, reporting missing files or directories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A-PUT<|>EVENT<|>A command used for uploading files or directories to Allas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Puhti is one of CSC's supercomputers where users can open a screen session and set up an Allas connection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROAD_CAMERAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dataset containing images from road condition cameras from ten locations over several years)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-CHECK<|>ALLAS<|>The a-check command is used to ensure compatibility and completeness of files for Allas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A-PUT<|>ALLAS<|>The a-put command is used for uploading data to Allas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Users can set up an Allas connection from Puhti to manage data storage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAD_CAMERAS<|>ALLAS<|>The road_cameras dataset is an example of complex data that can be uploaded to Allas<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
