We can avoid this by substituting the\nelement list with `$(ls project_3/)`. Now, command `ls project3` is\nused to produce a list of file names to be processed:\n\n```bash\nfor filename in $(ls project_3/)\ndo\n   echo \"Moving file: $filename\"\n   mv project_3/$filename project_3/\"$filename\".old\ndone\n```\n\nIn bash, you can also create a for loop where a numerical index variable\nis increased automatically by a certain step size in each iteration.\nIn this case, the syntax is:\n\n```bash\nfor ((variable=start; variable<=end; i++)) \n```\n\nBelow is a for loop that performs the same renaming operation as above,\nbut using just numbers as elements.\n\n```bash\nfor ((number=1; number<=9; number++))\ndo\n   echo \"Moving file: sample${number}.txt\"\n   mv project_3/sample${number}.txt project_3/sample${number}.txt.old\ndone\n```\n\nIn a `while` loop, the loop keeps running as long as the defined\ncondition statement is true. In bash, a while loop can be made with\nthe syntax:\n\n```bash\nwhile [[ condition ]]\ndo\n   commands\ndone\n```\n\nThe renaming operation, made above with a for loop, could also be done\nwith a while loop:\n\n```bash\nnumber=1\nwhile [[ $number -le 9 ]]\ndo\n   echo \"Moving file: sample${number}.txt\"\n   mv project_3/sample${number}.txt project_3/sample${number}.txt.old\n   ((number = number + 1))\ndone\n```\n\nIn the example above, a variable called `number` is first set to have\nvalue 1. The value of this variable is then increased by 1 in the end of\neach iteration cycle. The iterations are continued until the variable\nreaches value 10.\n\nConditional statements (`if`) can be made as follows:\n\n```bash\nif [[ condition ]]\nthen\n   commands\nelse\n   commands\nfi\n```\n\nYou can use operands listed in the table below in the conditional statements\nof `if` and `while` commands. Note that bash uses different conditional\nstatements for strings and integers. For example, the equality of strings\nis tested with `==` while the equality of integers is tested with `-eq`.\nThe syntax is also strict about the spaces between the brackets, and the\ncondition statement definition `[[a == b]]` will not work and should\nbe fixed to `[[ a == b ]]`.\n\nCommonly used string, integer and file operands of `if` and `while`\nstatements are listed below.\n\n| Statement       | Operation                                                 |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `[[ a == b ]]`  | True if strings a and b are equal                         |\n| `[[ a != b ]]`  | True if strings a and b are not equal                     |\n| `[[ a =~ b ]]`  | True if strings a and b are similar (allows wildcards)    |\n| `[[ a < b ]]`   | True if string a is alphabetically before string b        |\n| `[[ a > b ]]`   | True if string a is alphabetically after string b         |\n| `[[ a -eq b ]]` | True if integers a and b are equal                        |\n| `[[ a -ne b ]]` | True if integers a and b are not equal                    |\n| `[[ a -lt b ]]` | True if integer a is less than b                          |\n| `[[ a -gt b ]]` | True if integer a is greater than b                       |\n| `[[ a -le b ]]` | True if integer a is less or equal to b                   |\n| `[[ a -ge b ]]` | True if integer a is greater or equal to b                |\n| `[[ -e name ]]` | True if file exists                                       |\n| `[[ -n a ]]`    | True if string a has non-zero length                      |\n| `[[ A || B ]]`  | True if condition A or condition B is true (logical OR)   |\n| `[[ A && B ]]`  | True if condition A and condition B is true (logical AND) |\n| `[[ !
