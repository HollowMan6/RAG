Any pod that runs in Rahti 2 will use by default this IP to reach anything located outside Rahti 2 or a Route. It is possible, for selected namespaces that need it, to configure a dedicated IP. Each request is reviewed individually due to the fact that there is a limited pool of virtual IPs available.\n\n!!! warning \"Egress IP may change\"\n\n    The egress IP of Rahti 2 might change in the future. For example, if several versions of Rahti 2 are run in parallel each will have a different IP. Or if a major change in the underlining network infrastructure happens.\n\n\n## Using LoadBalancer Service Type with Dedicated IPs\n\nUnlike routes, the `LoadBalancer` service type makes it possible to expose services to the internet without being limited to HTTP/HTTPS. This feature allows you to expose services to receive external inbound traffic on a dedicated public IP address, ensuring that external users or services can interact with your applications. To enable and use LoadBalancer services within your Rahti 2 project, you must submit a request to the service desk (`servicedesk@csc.fi`). The request must include the following details:\n\n- **Project Name**: Provide the exact name of the Rahti 2 project for which you want to enable LoadBalancer services.\n\n- **Use Case**: Clearly describe the use case, including:\n    - The type of services you plan to expose (e.g., web applications, APIs).\n    - Any specific requirements or considerations.\n\nWhen your request is approved by the admins, you will receive the public IP address that can be used to access your services, and you can then proceed with the creation of the ```LoadBalancer``` service.\n\nFor example, the following service definition exposes a MySQL service on the assigned public IP at port 33306.\n\n\n```yaml\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: mysqllb\n  namespace: my-namespace\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 33306\n      targetPort: 3306\n  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  selector:\n    app: mysql\n```\n\nEnsure that the service type is set to `LoadBalancer`, and that the `allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts` field is set to false (the default is true) because NodePorts are not enabled in Rahti 2. If this field is not set correctly, the allocated node port will be unusable, and service creation may fail if the entire default node port range (`30000-32767`) is already allocated.\n\nAdditionally, the port field in the service definition (e.g., `33306` in the previous example) must be within the range of `30000-35000`.\n\n### Multiple LoadBalancer Services\n\nIt is also possible to expose multiple `LoadBalancer` services on the same public IP but on different ports, you can enable IP sharing by adding the `metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip` annotation to services. The value of the annotation is a label of your choice. The services annotated with the same label will share the same IP. Here is an example configuration of two services that share the same IP address:\n\n```yaml\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: mysqllb\n  namespace: my-namespace\n  annotations:\n     metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip: \"label-to-share-1.2.3.4\"\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 33306\n      targetPort: 3306\n  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  selector:\n    app: mysql\n```\n\n\n```yaml\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: httplb\n  namespace: my-namespace\n  annotations:\n     metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip: \"label-to-share-1.2.3.4\"\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 30080\n      targetPort: 80\n  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  selector:\n    app: httpd\n```\n\n!!! info\n    Just as a side note, in Rahti2, the way routes and external load balancer services manage traffic during deployment rollouts differently. \n\n    Routes, managed by OpenShift's HAProxy, are designed to quickly adjust and direct traffic as soon as a new pod starts and simultaneously cease routing to the old or terminating pods, ensuring rapid response to changes and minimizing service disruption. \n\n    In contrast, external load balancers distribute traffic not only to new pods but also continue to send requests to old or terminating pods. This behavior occurs because these services rely on periodic updates from [EndpointSlices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/pods-and-endpoint-termination-flow/), which can delay the exclusion of terminating pods from traffic distribution. This difference in handling traffic can be useful to understand, as it affects how deployment strategies should handled for application updates. \n    \n    For more information refer to the OpenShift documentation regarding [route based deployment strategies](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-proxy-shard_route-based-deployment-strategies).\n    To avoid disruptions when using external load balancer services, you can adopt the principle of a [blue-green deployment](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
