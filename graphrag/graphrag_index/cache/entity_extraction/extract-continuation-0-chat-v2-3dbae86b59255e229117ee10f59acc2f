the request to the same url while authenticated will\ntry to fetch `<bucket>` from your own project not `proj_id`. \n\nInstead the format `https://lumidata.eu/<proj_id>:<bucket>/<object>`\nmust be used.\n\nFor public objects the above two URLs are equivalent. \nNote that the authorization header of any request is checked before any access rules are \nverified -> using invalid credentials will lead to an access denied even for public objects. \n\n\nDue to the format of the URL, currently there is no known way to use boto3 or `aws` cli\nto interact with data which is specifically shared with your project.  \n\n\n**s3cmd and rclone**\n\nTo access buckets and subsequently objects not owned by the authenticated project:\n\n```\ns3cmd ls s3://<proj_id>:<bucket>/\n```\n\n```\nrclone ls lumi-465000001:\"<proj_id>:<bucket>\"\n```\nWhere `465000001` would be your own project you have configured authentication for\nand `<proj_id>` is the numerical project id for the other project. \n\n\n**Curl**\n\nDon't use curl unless you have to, main\npoint here is that the project id owning the bucket has to be included\nwith the bucket and object name when generating the signature.\n\n```\nobject=README.md\nbucket=BucketName\nproject=465000001\nresource=\"/$project:$bucket/$object\"\nendPoint=https://lumidata.eu$resource\n\n\ncontentType=\"text/plain\"\ndateValue=`date

\\\n     -H \"Authorization: AWS ${s3Key}:${signature}\" \\\n     $endPoint\n```\n\n## Presigned URLs\n\nPresigned URLs are URLs generated by the user which grant time-limited \"public\" access \nto an object. It's also possible to generate an URL which allows time-limited \nupload for a specific object (key) in a bucket. \n\n### Read-only presigned urls\n\nYou can generate a presigned url using e.g s3cmd \n\n```bash\ns3cmd signurl s3://<bucket_name>/<object_name> <unix_epoch_time>\n```\n\nThat generates access link that is valid until the given unix epoch time. To get the required unix epoch time, it's possible to use online calculators,\ne.g when one wants to grant access until a specific date, or then adding \nthe desired duration to the current time.\n\n```\ns3cmd signurl s3://<bucket_name>/<object_name> $(echo \"`date +%s` + 3600 * <nbr_of_hours>\" | bc)\n```\n\nIrregardless of the set expiry time, presigned urls will become invalid when\nthe access key used for the signing expires.  \n\nIt's also possible to use the `aws` command to presign:\n\n```bash\naws s3 presign s3://<bucket_name>/<object_name> --expires-in <seconds>\n```\n\n### Writable presigned urls\n\n\nThere is no way to create presigned urls for `PUT` operations \nusing either `s3cmd` or `aws`. Below is a short example script\nusing boto3 to generate a valid url that can be then used to add an object called `file.txt` to the defined bucket. \n\n``` bash\npython3 presign.py presign file.txt\ncurl -X PUT -T file.txt \"<generated url>\"\n```\n\n\n**presign.py**\n```python\nimport boto3\nimport argparse\n\ndef generate_presigned_url(s3_client, client_method, method_parameters, expires_in):\n    try:\n        url = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(\n            ClientMethod=client_method, Params=method_parameters, ExpiresIn=expires_in\n        )\n    except:\n        print(\"Couldn't get a presigned URL\")\n        raise\n    return url\n\ndef usage_demo():\n\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument(\"bucket\", help=\"The name of the bucket.\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"key\", help=\"The name of the bucket\")\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    s3_client = boto3.client(\"s3\")\n    client_action = \"put_object\"\n    url = generate_presigned_url(\n        s3_client, client_action, {\"Bucket\": args.bucket, \"Key\": args.key}, 1000\n    )\n    print(f\"Generated put_object url: {url}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    usage_demo()\n```\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUMIDATA.EU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lumidata.eu is a platform that allows for the interaction with data through specific URL formats and authentication methods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S3CMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>s3cmd is a command line tool for managing data in cloud storage services that are compatible with Amazon S3)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCLONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Curl is a command line tool used for transferring data with URLs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOTO3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMIDATA.EU<|>S3CMD<|>Lumidata.eu supports the use of s3cmd for accessing buckets and objects not owned by the authenticated project<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMIDATA.EU<|>RCLONE<|>Lumidata.eu supports the use of rclone for accessing buckets and objects not owned by the authenticated project<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMIDATA.EU<|>CURL<|>Lumidata.eu can be accessed using curl for generating signatures and making requests<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMIDATA.EU<|>AWS<|>Lumidata.eu's interaction format and authentication methods are similar to those used by AWS services<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUMIDATA.EU<|>BOTO3<|>Lumidata.eu does not currently support direct interaction with boto3 for data shared with a specific project<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
