Krona combines a variant of radial, space-filling \ndisplays with parametric coloring and interactive polar-coordinate zooming. \n\nKrona charts can be created using an Excel template or KronaTools, which includes support for several \nbioinformatics tools and raw data formats. The interactive charts are self-contained and can be \nviewed with any modern web browser.\n\n[TOC]\n\n## License\n\nKrona is free to use and open source. It is provided under its own [license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marbl/Krona/master/KronaTools/LICENSE.txt).\n\n## Available\n\n* Puhti: 2.8.1\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use KronaTools commands, load the biokit module:\n\n```bash\nmodule load biokit\n```\n\nMany bioinformatics tools provide classifications based on the NCBI Taxonomy. \nThese classifications can be imported to Krona via tab-separated files listing \ntaxonomy IDs.\n\nFor example, file `sample1.tsv`:\n\n```text title=\"sample1.tsv\"\n#queryID  #taxID  #score\nquery1    9606    0.9\nquery2    9534    0.8\n```\n\ncan be visualized with the command:\n\n```bash\nktImportTaxonomy sample1.tsv\n```\n\nThe three columns are by default _query-ID_, _taxonomy-ID_, and _score_ (optional),\nbut these can be changed using the options `-q`,`-t`, and `-s`. Commented lines (`#`) are ignored.\nFor example, an output file from [Kraken2](kraken.md) can be visualized with the command:\n\n```bash\nktImportTaxonomy -q 2 -t 3 KrakenOutput -o KronaReport.html\n```\n\nThe Krona visualizations are based on HTML5. To study them, you can open a virtual desktop in [Puhti web interface](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md) and open a browser there. \n\nAlternatively, you can copy these files to a publicly accessible data bucket in Allas, and study the results with your local web browser. You can use commands\n[a-flip](../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md#a-flip) or [a-publish](../data/Allas/using_allas/a_commands.md#a-publish) to do the copying:\n\nFor example the command:\n\n```bash\na-flip KronaReport.html\n```\n\nwill produce a URL that you can copy to your browser.\n\nIn addition to _ktImportTaxonomy_ there are several application-specific data import tools.\nFor example, for BLAST (`ktImportBLAST`) and MG-RAST (`ktImportMGRAST`). There are also general purpose tools\nfor text (`ktImportText`) and XML data (`ktImportXML`). On Puhti, you may also be interested to\nuse `ktImportDiskUsage` to visualize how many different datasets use space in your directories.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Krona wiki](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
