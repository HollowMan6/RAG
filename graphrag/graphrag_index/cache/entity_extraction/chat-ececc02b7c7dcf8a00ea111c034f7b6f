[As an interactive app on our web interface](../../computing/webinterface/vscode.md)\n2. [Remotely using the Remote-SSH plugin](./remote-dev.md#visual-studio-code-with-remote-ssh-plugin)\n\n!!! info \"Using custom environments in VSCode\"\n    Since only CSC modules are offered in the VSCode session launch form,\n    using custom Python environments with built-in VSCode functions like\n    debugging requires changing the path of the Python interpreter\n    after the session has launched. This can be done by clicking on\n    the Python version information displayed in the lower right corner\n    of the VSCode window.\n\n### Spyder\n\n[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is a scientific Python development\nenvironment. The [python-data](../../apps/python-data.md) and\n[geoconda](../../apps/geoconda.md) modules\nhave Spyder included. The best option for using it is through the\n[Puhti web interface remote desktop](../../computing/webinterface/desktop.md).\n\n## Python parallel jobs\n\nThere are several Python libraries for parallel computing. Below are a few suggestions:\n\n* [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) – process-based parallelism\n* [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) – running Python functions as pipeline jobs\n* [dask](https://docs.dask.org) – general purpose parallel programming solution\n* [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io) – MPI bindings for Python\n\nThe `multiprocessing` package is likely the easiest to use. Being part of the\nPython standard library, it is included in all Python installations by default.\n`joblib` provides some more flexibility in comparison. These two packages are suitable for\nsingle-node parallelization (max. 40 cores).\n\n`dask` is the most versatile of the bunch and has several options for\nparallelization. Please see the [CSC Dask tutorial](./dask-python.md) for\nexamples of both single-node (max. 40 cores) and multi-node parallelization.\n\nIn addition, there are examples of\n[using different parallelization options on Puhti](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/puhti)\non our CSC Training GitHub organization. Of the above four packages, examples are\nprovided for `multiprocessing`, `joblib` and `dask`.\n\nThe `mpi4py` package is included in our [PyTorch environment](../../apps/pytorch.md).\nIt is generally the most efficient option for multinode jobs with non-trivial parallelization.\nFor a short tutorial on `mpi4py`, along with other approaches for improving the\nperformance of Python programs, please see the free\n[Python in High Performance Computing](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/python-in-hpc)\nonline course.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
