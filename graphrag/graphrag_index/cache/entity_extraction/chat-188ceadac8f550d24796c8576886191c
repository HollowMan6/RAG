This is done using the `restore`\nsub-command.\n\n```bash\n$ module restore <collection-name>\n```\n\nMore options to manage collections of modules can be found by running `module\nhelp` or in the [Lmod User Manual][lmod_collection]. Note, however, that the\nlatter may contain options or commands that do not yet work on the version of\nLmod supported on LUMI.\n\n## Creating and using your own modules\n\nWhen you install software yourself, it may make life easier if you make it\navailable through a module. Some software for HPC systems will also produce\nmodules during the installation process, e.g., the Intel oneAPI compilers\n(which are not supported on LUMI).\n\nLmod supports most Tcl-based module files written for the various versions of\nEnvironment Modules. It also has its own format for module files, which are Lua\nprograms though with a restricted set of Lua functions available. More\ninformation on developing module files is available in the [Lmod\ndocumentation][lmod_doc]. Even though that documentation is for the latest\nversion of Lmod, it is likely very relevant for LUMI as the Lmod version \non LUMI is fairly close to the latest version at the moment.\n\n??? Tip \"Tip: Study an existing module file\"\n    If you want to study an existing module file then `module show <modulename>`\n    will also show you where to find the module file.\n\nAdding directories to the search path for modules is done with\n\n```bash\n$ module use <directory>\n```\n\nConversely, removing a directory is done with\n\n```bash\n$ module unuse <directory>\n```\n\nRemoving a directory from the module search path will also unload the modules\nthat are loaded from that directory.\n\n??? Tip \"For advanced users: Resetting the MODULEPATH\"\n    The search path for modules is stored in the environment variable\n    `MODULEPATH`. Adding directories to the search path by manipulating\n    `MODULEPATH` is possible. However, overwriting the variable and removing\n    directories can have nasty side effects and bring the internal data\n    structures of Lmod into an inconsistent state, e.g., because there may now be\n    modules loaded from directories that are not in the `MODULEPATH`.\n\n    If you want to overwrite `MODULEPATH`, e.g., to build your own private environment\n    fully independent from those that LUMI offers, you also need to re-initialise Lmod\n    by running\n\n    ```bash\n    $ source /usr/share/lmod/lmod/init/bash\n    ```\n\n## Further reading\n\nOn LUMI, we use the Lmod implementation as provided by HPE Cray as part of the\nprogramming environment. The version of Lmod is way behind the most recent\nversion. This implies that not all information that can be found on the internet\nis also correct for LUMI.\n\n- [Official Lmod documentation on readthedocs][lmod], but this is always for\n  the latest version.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
