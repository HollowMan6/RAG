In our [Puhti Python examples](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/puhti) there are examples how to utilize these different parallelisation libraries.\n\nIf you think that some important GIS package for Python is missing from here, you can ask for installation from [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).\n\n\n## Available\n\nThe `geoconda` module is available:\n\n* 3.11.9 (Python 3.11.9, PDAL 2.7.2, GDAL 3.9.1, created August 2024), in Puhti and Mahti.\n* 3.10.9 (Python 3.10.9, PDAL 2.5.2, GDAL 3.6.2, created March 2023), in Puhti.\n* 3.10.6 (Python 3.10.6, PDAL 2.4.1, GDAL 3.5.0, created September 2022), in Puhti and Mahti.\n\nVersion number is the same as the Python version.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor using Python packages and other tools listed above, you can initialize them with:\n\n```bash\nmodule load geoconda\n```\n\nBy default the latest geoconda module is loaded. If you want a specific version you can specify the version number of geoconda:\n\n```bash\nmodule load geoconda/[VERSION]\n```\n\nTo check the exact packages and versions included in the loaded module:\n\n```bash\nlist-packages\n```\n \nYou can add more Python packages to `geoconda` by following the instructions in\nour\n[Python usage guide](../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).\n\nYou can edit your Python code in Puhti with:\n\n* [Visual Studio Code in Puhti web interface](../computing/webinterface/vscode.md), \n* [Visual Studio Code on your local laptop](../support/tutorials/remote-dev.md),\n* [Jupyter Notebook or Lab in Puhti web interface](../computing/webinterface/jupyter.md) or \n* Spyder in [Puhti web interface with remote desktop](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md).\n\nTo open Spyder in Puhti web interface with remote desktop:\n\n1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi).\n2. Open Remote desktop: Apps -> Desktop. \n3. After launching the remote desktop open `Terminal` (Desktop icon) and start Spyder:\n\n```bash\nmodule load geoconda\nspyder\n```\n\n### r5py memory settings\n`r5py` by default does not correctly understand how much memory it has available in a supercomputer so, it has to be defined manually. It is using Java in the background, so add environmental variable to set maximum memory available for Java: \n\n* `export _JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Xmx4g\"` from command-line before starting Python OR\n* `os.environ[\"_JAVA_OPTIONS\"] = \"-Xmx4g\"` in the beginning of your Python code.\n\n### Google Earth Engine authentication set up\nFor using Google Earth Engine (GEE) API with `earthengine-api` package, one needs to have an account in GEE. Before first usage, also set up GEE authentication in Puhti:\n\n1. Open Puhti web interface\n2. Start Desktop app\n3. In the Desktop, open:\n    * Web Browser under Applications menu and\n    * Terminal from shortcuts\n4. In the Terminal:\n\n```\nmodule load geoconda\npython\n\nimport os\nos.environ['PATH'] = '/appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/google-cloud-sdk/bin:' + os.environ['PATH']\n\nimport ee\nee.Authenticate()\n```\n\nThis prints out a long link and asks for a code. Copy the link to the Web Browser and open the Google log-in page. Log-in and copy the created code back to Python.\n\n\n## Using Allas from Python\n\nThere are two Python libraries installed in Geoconda that can interact with Allas. __Swiftclient__ uses the swift protocol and __boto3__ uses S3 protocol. You can find CSC examples how to use both [here](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/allas). \n\nIt is also possible to __read__ and __write__ files from and to Allas or other cloud object storage directly with GDAL-based packages such as `geopandas` and `rasterio`. Please check our [Using geospatial files directly from cloud, inc Allas tutorial](../support/tutorials/gis/gdal_cloud.md) for instructions and examples.\n\nWith large quantities of data in Allas, consider using [virtual rasters](https://research.csc.fi/virtual_rasters). \n\n\n\n## License\n\nAll packages are licensed under various free and open source licenses (FOSS), see the linked pages above for exact details.\n\n## Citation\n\nPlease see the above linked package pages for citation information per package.\n\n##  Acknowledgement\n\nPlease acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports.\nAs an example, you can write \"The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072531) and the Open Geospatial Information Infrastructure for Research (Geoportti, urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072513) for computational resources and support\".\n\n## Installation\n\nGeoconda was installed to Puhti and Mahti using [Tykkys conda-containerize functionality](../computing/containers/tykky.md).
