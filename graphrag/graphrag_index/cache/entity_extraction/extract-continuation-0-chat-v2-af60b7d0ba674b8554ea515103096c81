Certain features specific to OpenShift\nare only available when using the oc tool.\n\n## How to install the `oc` tool\n\nThe oc tool is a single binary that only needs to be included in your _path_. You may download it from the [Getting started with the OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) page in OpenShift's documentation. Follow the detailed instructions in the link.\n\nIn order to test that it was properly installed, open a new terminal, go to any folder, and run:\n\n```\n$ oc --help\n```\n\nIt should show the list of all available commands.\n\n## The \"Command Line Tools\" page in the OpenShift web UI\n\nInstructions for downloading the oc tool including the download link for several platforms and operating systems can be found in the \"Command Line Tools\" page in the web interface:\n\n![Command line tools](../../img/cli_help_menu_4.png)\n\nafter clicking you will be welcomed with:\n\n![OpenShift Command Line Tools page](../../img/openshift_cli_dialog_4.png)\n\n## How to login with `oc`?\n\nThe oc login command to login can be found in the dropdown menu next to your name. There is a\nbutton next to it for copying the command to the clipboard. Copy the command and paste it in a terminal to start using OpenShift via the\ncommand line. The command looks like:\n\n```bash\noc login https://api.2.rahti.csc.fi:6443 --token=<secret access token>\n```\n\nThis command can be obtained by clicking your username and \"Copy Login Command\"\nin the web console:\n\n![copy login](../../img/CopyLoginCommand.png)\n\n!!! info \"sudo\"\n\n    If you open multiple terminals, the login session for oc will be active in\n    all of them.\n\n!!! info \"Helm login\"\n    If you are using Helm and you are not logged in, you might get an error like:\n    ```sh\n    $ helm ls       \n    Error: Kubernetes cluster unreachable: Get \"http://localhost:8080/version\": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused\n    ```\n\n## How to login in the registry?\n\nIn order to use Rahti 2 internal container registry, it is necessary to login separately. Once you login, it is possible to use the client docker to `pull` and `push` from Rahti 2's registry.\n\n### Using personal account\n\nAfter login with `oc`, it is possible to use the command to generate a token (`oc whoami -t`):\n\n`docker login -p $(oc whoami -t ) -u unused image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi`\n\n!!! info \"sudo use\"\n    Some docker client setups require to run the `docker` client as root using `sudo`. In this case the `oc login` command needs to also be run using `sudo`. This is because the login information is stored in the user's home directory, only the user that runs `oc login` is logged in to Rahti.\n\n    As a general recommendation, it is better to use other \"rootless\" runtimes like podman, when possible. It is also possible to configure Docker as non-root user. In order to do so, in most Linux distributions, you just need to type this command:  \n    \n    ```sh\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n    ```\n\n    And then log out and log back to have the group membership re-evaluated.\n\n### Using a service account token\n\nRahti 2 also offers the opportunity of using an internal service account to interact with the registry. This is recommended for automated procedures like a CI pipeline. Even though by default 3 internal service accounts are created in every Rahti 2 namespace: builder, default and deployer, it is recommended to create a dedicated internal service account and assign to it the `system:image-pusher` role.\n\n```sh\noc create serviceaccount pusher\noc policy add-role-to-user system:image-pusher pusher\ndocker login -p $(oc sa get-token pusher) -u unused image-registry.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi\n```\n\nThis service account token, the one you get with `oc sa get-token pusher` does not expire.\n\n## CLI cheat sheet\n\n**Basic usage:**\n\n```bash\noc <command> <--flags>\noc help <command>\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\nShow projects:\n\n```bash\noc projects\n```\n\nSwitch to project `my-project`:\n\n```bash\noc project my-project\n```\n\nShow all pods in the current namespace:\n\n```bash\noc get pods\n```\n\nShow all pods in the namespace `<my-other-name-space>`:\n\n```bash\noc get pods -n <my-other-namespace>\n```\n\nShow all pods that have the key-value pair `app: myapp` in `metadata.labels`:\n\n```bash\noc get pods --selector app=myapp\n```\n\nPrint the specifications of the pod `mypod`\n\n```bash\noc get pod mypod -o yaml\n```\n\n### Other useful commands\n\n* `oc create` creates an object. Example: `oc create -f file.yaml`\n* `oc replace` replaces an object. Example: `oc replace -f file.yaml`\n* `oc delete` deletes an object in OpenShift. Example: `oc delete rc\n  myreplicationcontroller`\n* `oc apply` modifies an object according to the input. Example `oc apply -f\n  file.yaml`\n* `oc explain` prints out the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rahti 2 is a platform that can be accessed and managed via command line tools such as OpenShift's oc tool or Kubernetes' kubectl tool)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSHIFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenShift provides documentation and tools for developers to manage applications, including the oc command line tool)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODMAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>OPENSHIFT<|>Rahti 2 utilizes OpenShift's oc tool for command line access and management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>KUBERNETES<|>Rahti 2 can also be managed using the kubectl tool from Kubernetes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHTI 2<|>DOCKER<|>Rahti 2's internal container registry can be accessed using Docker for pull and push operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCKER<|>PODMAN<|>Podman is recommended as a rootless alternative to Docker for running containers<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
