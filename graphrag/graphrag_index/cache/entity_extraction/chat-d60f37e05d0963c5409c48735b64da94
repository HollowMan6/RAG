If you do not want to use\nvirtual environments,Â you can skip these steps and move directly to\nthe installation instructions using pip.\n\nFirst install the python3-venv package. On Ubuntu:\n\n    sudo apt install python3-venv\n\nNote that on Red Hat based systems there is no need of installing a \ndedicated package. \n\nCreate a directory for your virtual environments. We give it a\nspecific name but you can call it something else as well:\n\n    mkdir python_virtualenvs\n\nGo to the directory and create a new virtual environment:\n\n    cd python_virtualenvs\n    python3 -m venv osclient\n\nThis creates a new directory called \"osclient\" in the\n\"python\\_virtualenvs\" directory. This directory will contain\neverything you install within the virtual environment. It also\ncontains a script for activating the environment that you need to run\nnext:\n\n    source osclient/bin/activate\n\nAfter activation, further Python or\npip commands will run in the context of the virtual environment. If\nyou now proceed with the installation instructions below, all packages\nwill be installed in your newly created virtual environment.Â You will\nknow that the \"osclient\" virtual environment is activated when you see\nthe text \"(osclient)\" before your prompt in the shell you are\nusing. If you install the command line clients inside a virtual\nenvironment, they will only be available within that virtual\nenvironment.\n\nAfter installation, if you want to deactivate the virtual environment,\nyou can simply type:\n\n    deactivate\n\nNote that doing this will also mean that any of the command line tools\nyou install will not be available for use until you reactivate the\nvirtual environment.\n\n#### Installing the client tools using pip\n\nOpenStack provides a set of Python tools for managing various aspects\nof its operation. Each subcomponent of OpenStack has its own tool.Â It\nalso provides the common shared tool\n*python-openstackclient*. The easiest way to install most of the\ncommand line tools is to install python-openstackclient. It should\npull several other clients as dependencies. If a tool you need is\nmissing even after installing python-openstackclient, please refer to\nthe table at the beginning of this page for a list of packages to\ninstall.\n\n!!! info\n\n    If you followed the instructions for setting up a virtual\n    environment, remove the \"sudo\" from the beginning of the commands\n    below. As you are installing in your own virtual environment, you do\n    not want to run the commands as root.\n\nInstall python-openstackclient with pip:\n\n    sudo pip install python-openstackclient\n\nIf you also want to install all the service-specific tools listed at\nthe beginning of this page:\n\n    sudo pip install python-keystoneclient python-novaclient python-glanceclient python-neutronclient\n\nDepending on your computer's setup, some dependencies might be\nmissing. The error message `ImportError: No module named\n<module>` can usually be fixed by installing the missing module\nwith pip and then repeating the previous, failed command. For some\nerrors during installation, updating setuptools or pip might help.\nUpgrade a package:\n\n    sudo pip install -U python_module_to_be_upgraded\n\n### Configure your terminal environment for OpenStack\n\nThe environment variables need to be set before you can use the\nclient. You can set them using a script provided in the OpenStack\nweb interface. You can download this script at the following URL\nafter logging in:\n\n> <a\n> href=\"https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/\"\n> class=\"external-link\">https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/</a>\n\nTo download this in the web interface, navigate to the\n*API Access* section, and press *Download OpenStack RC File v3.*\n\n![RC file example](../../img/pouta-openrc.png)\n\nOnce you have the openrc script from the web UI, you can add the\nenvironment variables:\n\n    source <project_name_here>-openrc.sh\n\nYou will be asked to type in a password. *Please use the password of your CSC\naccount* because the command line interface does not support yet the usage of\ncredentials from linked accounts, such as Haka or Virtu. After doing this, the\ncurrent terminal session will have the proper environment variables for using\nthe command line tools. You need to do this again if you open a new terminal.\n\n  [install it first]: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/\n  [SoftwareCollections.org]: https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/\n  [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python]: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
