GDAL and most tools depending on it can **read** directly from an public URL or S3 storage services. This eliminates the need to download the files manually before data analysis. GDAL can also **write** files to S3 storage services, but only some tools dependent on GDAL are supporting it. \n\nReading data directly from an external service is usually slower than reading from local disks, but in many cases, these seconds are negligible compared to the full duration of an analysis, but it is important to have good Internet connection.\n\nS3 services are very common for storing bigger amounts of data, for example:\n\n* CSC [Allas](../../../data/Allas/index.md),\n* EuroHPC [LUMI-O](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/),\n* ESA [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem S3](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/S3.html),\n* Amazon [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/),\n* Google [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage),\n* Microsoft [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/) etc. \n\nMore details on how to use GDAL with public files from URL (VSICURL) and private files in S3 (VSIS3) storage are given below. Special attention is on CSC Allas object storage service and supercomputers. For using GDAL on a supercomputer, a module including [GDAL](../../../apps/gdal.md), must be activated.\n\n## Reading public files from URL\n\n[VSICURL](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#vsicurl) can be used for reading files available via URL. Public objects in S3 storage usually also have an URL, so this works also for public S3 files. VSICURL also supports partial reading of files, so it works well with cloud-optimized file formats. VSICURL also supports basic authentication. \n\n```\n# A public file\ngdalinfo /vsicurl/URL\n\n# For example, from Paituli\ngdalinfo /vsicurl/https://www.nic.funet.fi/index/geodata/mml/orto/normal_color_3067/mara_v_25000_50/2023/N33/02m/1/N3324F.jp2\n\n# CSC Allas\ngdalinfo /vsicurl/https://a3s.fi/bucket_name/object_name\n# OR alternatively\ngdalinfo /vsicurl/https://bucket_name.a3s.fi/object_name\n\n# Amazon S3 (us-west-2)\ngdalinfo /vsicurl/https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bucket_name/object_name\n\n#Depending on GDAL installation settings VSICURL may sometimes work also without the `/vsicurl/` before the URL.\ngdalinfo URL\n```\n\n## Reading and writing files from/to S3 services\n\nGDAL's [VSIS3](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#vsis3-aws-s3-files) is for working with S3 services. \n\n\n### S3 connection details\n\nFor accessing the data from S3 services, first the connection details must be set correctly. Usually the following connection details are needed:\n\n* end-point URL\n* region\n* access and secret key\n\nEach service's user guide should specify the end-point and region and give instructions how to find the keys. It is recommended to save the keys and region name to `credentials` file, located in `C:\\Users\\username\\.aws\\credentials` on Windows or `~/.aws/credentials` on Mac or Linux. For example the Allas the credentials file could look like this:\n\n```\n[allas_project1]\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyy\nAWS_DEFAULT_REGION=regionOne\n```\n\nThe end-point URL is not needed for Amazon S3, but is needed for other services. Unfortunately it can not be given via `credentials` file, but needs to be given to GDAL as environment variable. For example to set Allas end-point: Windows command shell: `set AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=a3s.fi` or Linux/Max: `export AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=a3s.fi`\n\n#### S3 connection set up for Allas \n\nOn CSC supercomputers the easiest option to set up Allas connection details is to use [allas-conf command](../../../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md#configuring-s3-connection-in-supercomputers):\n\n```\nmodule load allas\nallas-conf --mode s3cmd\n```\n\n* `module load allas` sets AWS_S3_ENDPOINT environment variable, which needs to be run each time S3 is used.\n* `allas-conf --mode s3cmd` writes the keys and region name to `credentials` file (also prints them to Terminal) and must be run only when using first time or when changing the CSC project.\n\nAfter this, you are ready to use GDAL or GDAL-based tools on supercomputers.\n\nIf you want to use Allas on some other machine, then copy `~/.aws/credentials` file from supercomputer to the other machine and set `AWS_S\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GDAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GDAL is the main open-source library for reading and writing geospatial data, supporting various geospatial file formats and network-based file systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QGIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>QGIS is a free, open-source geographic information system that relies on GDAL for data processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCGIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ArcGIS is a geographic information system for working with maps and geographic information, utilizing GDAL for data handling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python is a programming language that can use GDAL for geospatial data manipulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing that integrates with GDAL for geospatial data analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>S3 storage services refer to web services that offer scalable storage for data, including geospatial files, accessible via the internet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allas is a storage service provided by CSC for storing large amounts of data, including geospatial data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROHPC LUMI-O<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LUMI-O is a storage component of the LUMI supercomputer, offering storage solutions including for geospatial data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESA COPERNCIUS DATA SPACE ECOSYSTEM S3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem S3 is a storage service by ESA for Copernicus satellite data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON S3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon S3 is a scalable storage service by Amazon, widely used for storing and retrieving any amount of data, including geospatial data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Cloud Storage is a service by Google for storing and accessing data on Google's infrastructure, including geospatial data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE BLOB STORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud, used for storing large amounts of unstructured data, including geospatial data)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDAL<|>QGIS<|>QGIS relies on GDAL for its data processing capabilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDAL<|>ARCGIS<|>ArcGIS utilizes GDAL for handling geospatial data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDAL<|>PYTHON<|>Python can use GDAL for manipulating geospatial data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDAL<|>R<|>R integrates with GDAL for geospatial data analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDAL<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>GDAL supports reading from and writing to S3 storage services<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>CSC ALLAS<|>CSC Allas is an example of an S3 storage service<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>EUROHPC LUMI-O<|>EuroHPC LUMI-O is part of the S3 storage services ecosystem<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>ESA COPERNCIUS DATA SPACE ECOSYSTEM S3<|>ESA Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem S3 is a specialized S3 storage service for satellite data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>AMAZON S3<|>Amazon S3 is a leading provider of S3 storage services<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE<|>Google Cloud Storage is recognized as an S3 storage service<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S3 STORAGE SERVICES<|>MICROSOFT AZURE BLOB STORAGE<|>Microsoft Azure Blob Storage is part of the S3 storage services available<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
