DeepSpeed is supported in the [PyTorch\nmodules in Puhti and Mahti](../../apps/pytorch.md) since version\n1.10. DeepSpeed is not yet fully supported on LUMI.\n\nExample of running DeepSpeed on a single full node using the\n`deepspeed` launcher:\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpu\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=40\n    #SBATCH --mem=320G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:4\n    \n    module purge\n    module load pytorch\n    \n    srun apptainer_wrapper exec deepspeed myprog.py \\\n        --deepspeed --deepspeed_config my_ds_config.json \\\n        <further options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpumedium\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=128\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:4\n\n    module purge\n    module load pytorch\n\n    srun apptainer_wrapper exec deepspeed myprog.py \\\n        --deepspeed --deepspeed_config my_ds_config.json \\\n        <further options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"LUMI\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=small-g\n    #SBATCH --ntasks=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=56\n    #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8\n    #SBATCH --mem=480G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n\n    module purge\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n    module load pytorch\n\n    srun singularity_wrapper exec deepspeed myprog.py \\\n        --deepspeed --deepspeed_config my_ds_config.json \\\n        <further options>\n    ```\n   \n<br/>\n\nExample of running DeepSpeed on 2 full nodes using MPI for launching a\nseparate task for each GPU:\n\n=== \"Puhti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpu\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10\n    #SBATCH --mem=320G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:4\n    \n    module purge\n    module load pytorch\n\n    srun python3 myprog.py \\\n        --deepspeed --deepspeed_config my_ds_config.json \\\n        <further options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mahti\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=gpumedium\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:4\n    \n    module purge\n    module load pytorch\n\n    srun python3 myprog.py \\\n        --deepspeed --deepspeed_config my_ds_config.json \\\n        <further options>\n    ```\n\n=== \"LUMI\"\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    #SBATCH --account=<project>\n    #SBATCH --partition=small-g\n    #SBATCH --nodes=2\n    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=7\n    #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8\n    #SBATCH --mem=480G\n    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00\n\n    module purge\n    module use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\n    module load pytorch\n\n    srun python3 myprog.py \\\n        --deepspeed --deepspeed_config my_ds_config.json \\\n        <further options>\n    ```\n\n\nIf you are converting an old PyTorch script there are a few steps that\nyou need to do:\n\n1. Make sure it handles the DeepSpeed command line arguments, for example:\n\n    ```python\n    import argparse\n    \n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    # handle any own command line arguments here\n    parser = deepspeed.add_config_arguments(parser)\n    \n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    ```\n\n2. Initialize the distributed environment, for example:\n\n    ```python\n    import deepspeed\n\n    deepspeed.init_distributed()\n    ```\n    \n3. Initialize the DeepSpeed engine:\n\n    ```python\n    model = # defined in normal way\n    train_dataset = # defined normally\n    \n    model_engine, optimizer, train_loader, __ = deepspeed.initialize(\n        args=args, model=model, model_parameters=model.parameters(),\n        training_data=train_dataset)\n    ```\n    \n4. Modify the training loop to use the DeepSpeed engine:\n\n    ```python\n    for batch in train_loader:\n        data = batch[0].to(model_engine.local_rank)\n        labels = batch[1].to(model_engine.local\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEEPSPEED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DeepSpeed is an optimization software suite for PyTorch that helps in scaling both training and inference for large deep learning models, supported in PyTorch modules in Puhti and Mahti since version 1.10)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, supported by DeepSpeed for optimization)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>Puhti is a computing environment where DeepSpeed is supported for PyTorch modules since version 1.10)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Mahti is a computing environment where DeepSpeed is supported for PyTorch modules since version 1.10)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMI<|>GEO<|>LUMI is a computing environment mentioned as not yet fully supporting DeepSpeed)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPSPEED<|>PYTORCH<|>DeepSpeed is an optimization suite specifically designed for PyTorch to enhance performance and scalability<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPSPEED<|>PUHTI<|>DeepSpeed is supported in the PyTorch modules in Puhti, indicating a direct application and usage relationship<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPSPEED<|>MAHTI<|>DeepSpeed is supported in the PyTorch modules in Mahti, indicating a direct application and usage relationship<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPSPEED<|>LUMI<|>DeepSpeed is mentioned in the context of LUMI, indicating a potential future support or interest in implementation<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>PUHTI<|>PyTorch modules, optimized by DeepSpeed, are available in Puhti, showing a usage and support relationship<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTORCH<|>MAHTI<|>PyTorch modules, optimized by DeepSpeed, are available in Mahti, showing a usage and support relationship<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
