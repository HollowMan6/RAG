Now 48 nodes with 192 GiB of memory, and 12 nodes with 768 GiB of memory have been equipped with local disks that have a size of 1490 GiB. Later in 2022 all the big memory nodes with 1,5TiB of memory will be upgraded with 6 TiB disks. These are in addition to the original 40 CPU nodes and 80 GPU nodes with 3600 GiB NVMes.
