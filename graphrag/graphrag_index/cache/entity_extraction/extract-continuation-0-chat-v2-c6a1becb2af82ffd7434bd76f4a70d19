Upload the input data to Allas using `boto3` or [another\n   client](../accessing_allas.md).\n2. Download the data from Allas to a local device\n(i.e. personal workstation or CSC supercomputer) using `boto3`.\n3. Analyze your local copy of the data.\n4. Write the analysis results to your local storage.\n5. Upload the results to Allas using `boto3`.\n\nSome Python libraries support direct reading and writing over S3,\nsuch as\n[AWS SDK for pandas](https://aws-sdk-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\nand\n[GDAL-based libraries](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/python/allas/working_with_allas_from_Python_S3.py)\n(for working with geospatial data).\n\n!!! note \"\"\n    Remember to avoid handling the same objects with both S3 and SWIFT, as\n    [they work differently with large objects](../introduction.md#protocols).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installation on a personal workstation\n\n`boto3` is available for Python 3.8 and higher.\nIt can be\n[installed on a personal device](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#installation)\nusing `pip` or `conda`.\n\n```bash\n# pip\npip install boto3\n\n# conda\nconda install anaconda::boto3\n```\n\n### Installation on a CSC supercomputer\n\nThe pre-existing [`geoconda`](../../../apps/geoconda.md) and\n[`biopythontools`](../../../apps/biopython.md) modules already have `boto3`\ninstalled. If you wish to use the library in another Python environment, you can\nuse `pip` to\n[add it on top of an existing module](../../../support/tutorials/python-usage-guide.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).\n\n## Configuring S3 credentials\n\n### Credentials for accessing a single project\n\nThe easiest way to set up S3 credentials for using `boto3` is by\n[configuring an S3 connection on a CSC supercomputer](s3_client.md#configuring-s3-connection-in-supercomputers).\nAfter running `allas-conf --mode s3cmd`, the credentials are stored in\n`~/.aws/credentials`, which is the default location where `boto3` looks for\nthem. You can also define another location for the credentials file by\nmodifying the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable.\n\nIf you wish to access Allas from a personal workstation,\nyou can simply copy the credentials file to your device\n[using a file transfer tool](../../moving/index.md) like `scp`.\nIf you want `boto3` to find the credentials automatically\nwithout having to modify `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`,\nmake sure that you also copy the parent directory as in the example\nbelow.\n\n```bash\n# Copy the credentials file and its parent directory to your home directory\nscp -r <username>@<hostname>.csc.fi:~/.aws $HOME\n```\n\n### Credentials for accessing multiple projects\n\nUsing `allas-conf --mode s3cmd` is straightforward,\nbut it overwrites the existing credentials file when run,\nmaking it somewhat tedious to work with multiple projects.\nTherefore, it is recommended to use the \n[Cloud storage configuration](../../../computing/webinterface/file-browser.md#accessing-allas-and-lumi-o)\napp in the [Puhti](https://puhti.csc.fi) or [Mahti](https://mahti.csc.fi)\nweb interface to configure S3 connections, since these configurations are\nstored under\n[individual S3 profiles](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#shared-credentials-file).\n\n1. Use *Cloud storage configuration* to configure S3 connections,\nor _remotes_, for the projects whose Allas storage you wish\nto access. The configurations are stored in `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` on\nthe supercomputer whose web interface you used for generating them.\n\n2. The S3 configuration entries for the access key ID and secret access key\nneed to be prefixed with `aws_` for `boto3` to recognize them as S3\ncredentials, but we do not want to make changes directly to\n`~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`, as it is used by other programs.\nInstead, use the `sed` utility to read the contents of the configuration file,\nmake the necessary changes, and write the modified contents to a new file,\nfor example `~/.boto3_credentials`. This can all be done with the following command.\n\n    ```bash\n    sed -E 's/^(access|secret)/aws_\\1/g' ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf > ~/.boto3_credentials\n    ```\n\nAfter completing these steps, your S3 credentials for using `boto3` are stored\nunder project-specific S3 profiles in the file you created in step 2. The profile names\nhave the format `s3allas-<project>`, e.g. `s3allas-project_2001234`.\nYou can now use these credentials to\n[create a `boto3` resource](#create-b\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AWS SDK FOR PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Python library developed for working with Amazon S3 storage and other AWS services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A storage solution accessed over the S3 protocol using boto3 or another client)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON S3 STORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon's cloud storage service that can be accessed using boto3 for data storage and retrieval)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS SDK FOR PANDAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Python library that supports direct reading and writing over S3 for data analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GDAL-BASED LIBRARIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Libraries for working with geospatial data, supporting operations over S3)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEOCONDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-existing module on CSC supercomputers that includes boto3 installed for geospatial data analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOPYTHONTOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-existing module on CSC supercomputers that includes boto3 installed for biological data analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supercomputers provided by CSC that offer computing resources and have modules like geoconda and biopythontools installed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUHTI<|>GEO<|>A CSC supercomputer that users can configure S3 connections on for accessing Allas storage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHTI<|>GEO<|>Another CSC supercomputer where users can configure S3 connections for accessing Allas storage)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWS SDK FOR PYTHON<|>AMAZON S3 STORAGE<|>The AWS SDK for Python is developed specifically for interacting with Amazon S3 Storage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLAS<|>AWS SDK FOR PYTHON<|>Allas can be accessed using the AWS SDK for Python via the S3 protocol<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWS SDK FOR PANDAS<|>ALLAS<|>AWS SDK for pandas supports direct operations over S3, making it compatible with Allas storage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDAL-BASED LIBRARIES<|>ALLAS<|>GDAL-based libraries can work with Allas storage over S3 for geospatial data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEOCONDA<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>Geoconda is a module available on CSC supercomputers that includes boto3<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOPYTHONTOOLS<|>CSC SUPERCOMPUTER<|>Biopythontools is a module available on CSC supercomputers that includes boto3<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Puhti supercomputer users can configure S3 connections for accessing Allas storage<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHTI<|>ALLAS<|>Mahti supercomputer users can configure S3 connections for accessing Allas storage<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
