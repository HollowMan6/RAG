To be able to use Allas, you need to be a member of \na CSC project that has the permission to use Allas. If you do not have a CSC account, you must first register as a CSC user\nand join or start a computing project for which Allas has been enabled. This can be done in the\nMyCSC user portal: [https://my.csc.fi]( https://my.csc.fi).\n\nOnce you have Allas enabled you can access it from any machine or server that is connected to internet. This can be a your laptop, supercomputer at CSC, virtual machine in cloud or enven your phone.\n\n\n## Accessing Allas from the web browser\n\nAt the moment CSC provides several web browser interfaces for Allas:\n\nThe **WWW interfaces of Puhti and Mahti** are connected to Allas. \nThese interfaces allow you transfer files and directories between your local computer and Allas as well as\nbetween CSC supercomputers and Allas.\n\n* [Instructions for using Allas in Puhti and Mahti web interfaces](../../computing/webinterface/file-browser.md)\n* [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi)\n* [Mahti web interface](https://www.mahti.csc.fi)\n\n\nThe OpenStack Horizon web interface in **cPouta** provides easy-to-use basic functions for data management in Allas. This interface can only be used for files smaller than 5 GB.\n\n* [Web client â€“ OpenStack Horizon Dashboard](./using_allas/web_client.md)\n* [cPouta Web Interface](https://pouta.csc.fi)\n\n\n**SD Connect** provides an interface for storing and sharing sensitive data. \nThis service is based on Allas but we don't recommend it for other than sensitive data.\n\n* [SD Connect instructions](../sensitive-data/sd_connect.md)\n* [SD Connect interface](https://sd-connect.csc.fi)\n\n\n\n## Accessing Allas in the CSC computing environment and other Linux platforms\n\nCSC supercomputers Puhti and Mahti support many different command line tools for using Allas, These include\n\n* [**a-tools**](./using_allas/a_commands.md) for basic use: (Swift, optionally S3)\n* [**rclone**](./using_allas/rclone.md) providing some advanced functions:** (Swift, optionally S3) \n* [**swift**](./using_allas/swift_client.md) python client that provides wide range of functionalities (Swift)\n* [**s3cmd**](./using_allas/s3_client.md) an S3 client and persistent Allas connections:** (S3)\n\nNote that the tools listed above utilize two different protocols: _Swift_ and _S3_. Data uploaded using one protocol is not necessary compatible with another protocol. \n\nThe software listed above can also be used on other devices, for example a virtual machine running in cPouta or your own laptop.\n\nIn Puhti and Mahti the Allas tools listed above are installed by CSC and provided through _allas_ module.\nIn order to use Allas in Puhti or Mahti, first load the Allas module:\n```text\nmodule load allas\n```\nAllas access for a specific project using swift protocol can then be enabled:\n```text\nallas-conf\n```\nTo enable S3 protocol, use option `-m S3`\n```text\nallas-conf -m S3\n```\nThe `allas-conf` command prompts for your CSC password (the same that you use to login to CSC servers). It lists your Allas projects and asks you to define a project (if not already defined as an argument). `allas-conf` generates an `rclone` configuration file for the Allas service and authenticates the connection to the selected project. `allas-conf` enables you to use only one Allas project at a time in one session. The project you are using in Allas does not need to match the project you are using in Puhti or Mahti, and you can switch to another project by running `allas-conf` again.\n\nIn the case of the Swift protocol, the authentication information is stored in the `OS_AUTH_TOKEN` and `OS_STORAGE_URL` environment variables and is valid for up to eight hours. However, you can refresh the authentication at any time by running `allas-conf` again. The environment variables are set only for the current login session, so you need to configure authentication individually for each shell with which you wish to access Allas.\n\nIn the case of the S3 protocol, the authentication information is stored in configuration files located in your home directory on the device. The same authentication is used for all login sessions and it does not have an expiration time.\n\nOnce an Allas connection is configured, you can start using the object storage with the tools listed above. \n\nBasic Allas operations with different tools.\n\n| Tool\t| List objects in bucket _buck_123_\t| Upload file _data1.txt_ to bucket _buck_123_ |\tDownload file _data1.txt_ from bucket _buck_123_ |\n|-------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| [a-commands](using_allas/a_commands.md) |`a-list buck_123` | `a-put data1.txt -b buck_123` | `a-get buck_123/data1.txt.zst` |\n| [rclone (swift)](using_allas/rclone.md) |`rclone ls allas:buck_123` | `rclone copy data1.txt allas:buck_123/` |\t`rclone copy allas:buck_123/data1.txt ./`|\n| [\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
