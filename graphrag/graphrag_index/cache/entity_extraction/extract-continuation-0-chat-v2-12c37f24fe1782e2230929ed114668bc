It should be used only for rescue operations when normal SSH access is not possible.\n\n## Mount the disk \n\n1. Check what volumes you have. If you don't have any other volumes attached it should look something like this:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ lsblk\n\tNAME   MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\n\tvda    253:0    0  10G  0 disk\n\t└─vda1 253:1    0  10G  0 part\n\tvdb    253:16   0  80G  0 disk\n\t└─vdb1 253:17   0  80G  0 part /\n\t```\n\n1. Now you want to mount `vdb1` to `/tmp/mnt` and go to that directory:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ sudo mkdir -p /tmp/mnt\n\t$ sudo mount /dev/vdb1 /tmp/mnt/\n\t```\n\n## Change bootloader (Grub)\n\n1. Take a backup of grub:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ cp /tmp/mnt/boot/grub2/grub.cfg /tmp/mnt/root/grub.cfg.bak-$(date +\"%F\")\n\t```\n\n1. Open `/tmp/mnt/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` with your favorite text editor. Remove the first `menuentry` section. \n\n    *NOTE:* This might not be the correct solution for your specific problem. The first menuentry is normally your latest and default kernel. \n\n## Use `chroot` to change the `/` folder\n\nIn case that your instance has issues due to some broken packages or drivers, then you can switch to your original and fix the problems using the following commands:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo mv /tmp/mnt/etc/resolv.conf{,.bak}\n$ sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /tmp/mnt/etc/resolv.conf\n$ sudo chroot /tmp/mnt\n```\n\nThe `chroot` has now changed your root folder `/` to `/tmp/mnt/` (your VM's disk partition). And can do any fix or change like uninstalling or reinstalling a package. \n\n## Get out of rescue\n\n1. Log out from the instances and `unrescue` the instance:\n\n\t```sh\n\topenstack server unrescue $INSTANCE_UUID\n\t```\n\n1. It would be a good idea to verify that a restart works after the kernel reinstallation:\n\n\t```sh\n\tssh <default-user>@<floating-ip> reboot\n\t```\n\n    wait to boot and ssh to it again:\n\n\t```sh\n\tssh <default-user>@<floating-ip>\n\t```\n\n    It should work as before the incident happened.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CIRROS IMAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cirros image is a small Linux distribution with limited software support and security updates, used for rescue operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH refers to Secure Shell, a protocol used to securely access and manage a computer over an unsecured network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is a program that loads the Linux kernel into the computer's memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHROOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CHROOT is a command on Unix-like operating systems that changes the root directory for the current running process and its children)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenStack is a cloud computing platform that enables users to control large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CIRROS IMAGE<|>SSH<|>Cirros image is used for rescue operations when normal SSH access is not possible<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRUB<|>CIRROS IMAGE<|>GRUB configuration may be modified during rescue operations involving Cirros image<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHROOT<|>CIRROS IMAGE<|>CHROOT is used to change the root directory as part of rescue operations with Cirros image<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENSTACK<|>CIRROS IMAGE<|>OpenStack commands are used to manage instances, including rescuing instances with Cirros image<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
