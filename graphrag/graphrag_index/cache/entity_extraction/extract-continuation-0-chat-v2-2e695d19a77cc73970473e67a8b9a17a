This is an efficient\noption in cases where you want to run many similar, but independent,\nsimulations. Typical use cases are enhanced sampling methods such as replica\nexchange MD. Also, since Amber simulations do not typically scale that well to\nmultiple GPUs, multi-simulations can be used as a straightforward method to\naccelerate sampling by launching several differently initialized copies of your\nsystem, all running simultaneously on a single GCD each. If your system is very\nsmall and hence unable to utilize the full capacity of a GCD, it might even\nmake sense to run multiple replicas on the same GCD to maximize efficiency.\n\n!!! info \"Note\"\n    GPU resources on Puhti and Mahti are scarce, so we recommend running\n    large-scale multi-pmemd simulations only on LUMI. LUMI-G has a massive GPU\n    capacity available, which is also\n    [more affordable in terms of BUs](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/lumi_env/billing/)\n    compared to Puhti and Mahti.\n\nAn example multi-pmemd batch script for LUMI-G is provided below.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=standard-g\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8\n#SBATCH --time=01:00:00\n#SBATCH --account=<project>\n\nmodule use /appl/local/csc/modulefiles\nmodule load amber/24-gpu\n\nexport MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1\n\ncat << EOF > select_gpu\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\\$SLURM_LOCALID\nexec \\$*\nEOF\n\nchmod +x ./select_gpu\n\nCPU_BIND=\"mask_cpu:fe000000000000,fe00000000000000\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe0000,fe000000\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe,fe00\"\nCPU_BIND=\"${CPU_BIND},fe00000000,fe0000000000\"\n\nsrun --cpu-bind=$CPU_BIND ./select_gpu pmemd.hip.MPI -ng 16 -groupfile groupfile\n```\n\nIn this example, 16 copies of a system are run concurrently within a single\nAmber job, each using 1 GCD. 2 nodes are requested in total as each node on\nLUMI-G contains 8 GCDs (4 GPUs).
