Here you find information on compiling, developing, optimizing, and debugging
code for use with LUMI. If you are looking for ways to install your scientific
software on LUMI, consult the [software section][software-overview] instead.

LUMI provides multiple compiler suites for compiling code using the most common
compilers. To get started, you may want to familiarize yourself with the
[programming environment][programming-environment]. In addition, common
scientific libraries tuned for LUMI are also available. Finally, parallel
debugger and profiling tools are provided for use with LUMI as well.
