His artworks, such as the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper, set the bar high, inspiring many artists to refine and expand their own techniques. His influence resonated through his meticulous observations, his versatility, and his seamless integration of art with science and discovery.', 'global_answer': \"### Key Findings on Leonardo da Vinci's Relationships with Institutions\\n\\nLeonardo da Vinci had significant relationships with various influential institutions, including the Signoria, the University of Padua, and multiple museums like the Louvre. These connections highlight his recognition and impact within the artistic and scientific communities.\\n\\n#### The Signoria\\n\\nLeonardo da Vinci had a notable relationship with the Signoria, where he decorated the Council Hall. This association underscores the recognition of his work by an influential institution [Data: Relationships (32, 52, 102, +more)]. The Signoria's appreciation for his artwork during his time indicates his expertise and influence in the Florentine art scene.\\n\\nAdditionally, the connection to the Signoria may have played a part in shaping his political and artistic context, as it was a crucial institution in Florence's governance. This relationship contributed to both his income and his professional standing [Data: Relationships (17, 66)].\\n\\n#### The University of Padua\\n\\nLeonardo da Vinci's ties to the University of Padua underscore his scientific contributions and his interactions within the intellectual community of the time. His connection with the university allowed him to express his scientific ideas and potentially gain new perspectives from other prominent figures [Data: Relationships (32, 52, 102, +more)]. This suggests that the artistic and scientific fields were not entirely separate domains for him, as he maintained a strong footing in both.\\n\\nFurthermore, his interest in anatomical studies was a significant part of his artistic process's rigor, which likely influenced his work at the university. His interactions in Padua may have contributed to his understanding of perspective and form, which are evident in his artworks [Data: Entities (10), Relationships (66, 17)].\\n\\n#### The Louvre and Other Museums\\n\\nThe Louvre is associated with some of Leonardo da Vinci's works, including the Mona Lisa and an incomplete painting of St. John the Baptist. The presence of his art at the Louvre is a testament to his international reputation, as it houses significant pieces that attract millions of visitors each year [Data: Relationships (56, 71, 72, 60)].
